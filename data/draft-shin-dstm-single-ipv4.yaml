abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an enhanced dual stack mechanism used in DSTM[1]
    by adding a new DHCPv6 option which provides a method to assign a single IPv4
    global address with TCP/UDP port range to all dual stack hosts in DSTM domain
    instead of dynamic IPv4 global address allocation. This enhancement to DSTM will
    result in a more efficient mechanism to allow IPv4/IPv6 hosts to communicate with
    IPv4 only hosts using a single IPv4 global address only.</p>"
