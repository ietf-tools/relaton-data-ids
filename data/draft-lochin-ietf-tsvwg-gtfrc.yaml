abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces gTFRC, a TCP-Friendly Rate Control providing throughput
    guarantee over the DiffServ/AF class. gTFRC is largely based on TFRC [2]. It provides
    a mean to take into account the quality of service negotiated with the network.
    As a result, the mechanism is able to reach a minimum throughput guarantee whatever
    the flow's RTT and target rate.</p>"
