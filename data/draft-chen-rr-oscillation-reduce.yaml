abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a simple revision to Route Reflection that allows
    a Route Reflector to send a route advertisement (instead of a route withdraw)
    in certain cases. The route advertisement helps narrow the gap between Route Reflection
    and IBGP full-mesh in terms of routing information. It has been shown that the
    proposed mechanism helps achieve stable route selection and eliminate a number
    of persistent route oscillations involving Route Reflection.</p>"
