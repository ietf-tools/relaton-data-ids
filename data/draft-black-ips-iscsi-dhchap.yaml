abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an authentication mechanism based on enhancing
    CHAP [RFC 1994] with a Diffie-Hellman Exchange (see Section 22.1 of [Schneier]
    in order to prevent a passive eavesdropper from acquiring sufficient information
    to perform an off-line dictionary attack on the CHAP secret. The use of this authentication
    mechanism with iSCSI [iSCSI] is discussed, along with a brief comparison to the
    existing CHAP and SRP authentication mechanisms in iSCSI. Caution should be exercised
    in drawing inferences from the fact that the author of this draft is one of the
    chairs of the IP Storage Working Group. This draft is an individual submission
    that the IP Storage Working Group is free to adopt, modify, reject, fold, spindle,
    and/or mutilate as it sees fit.</p>"
