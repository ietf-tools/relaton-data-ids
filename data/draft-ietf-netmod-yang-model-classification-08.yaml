abstract:
- content: "<p>The YANG data modeling language is currently being considered for a
    wide variety of applications throughout the networking industry at large. Many
    standards development organizations (SDOs), open-source software projects, vendors,
    and users are using YANG to develop and publish YANG modules for a wide variety
    of applications. At the same time, there is currently no well-known terminology
    to categorize various types of YANG modules. A consistent terminology would help
    with the categorization of YANG modules, assist in the analysis of the YANG data
    modeling efforts in the IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the
    YANG- related discussions between the different groups. This document describes
    a set of concepts and associated terms to support consistent classification of
    YANG modules.</p>"
