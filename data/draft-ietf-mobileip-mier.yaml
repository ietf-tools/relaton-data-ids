abstract:
- content: "<p>It is in the interest of the Mobile IP WG to conserve the usage of
    the type field since we see many drafts proposing new extensions for Mobile IP.
    Therefore there is a real need to find ways to limit the usage of the type field
    in the extensions structure. MIER describes a new extension structure to Mobile
    IP to make the extensions far more extensible.</p>"
