abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a company name to URL mapping service based
    on the oldest and least complex of Internet directory protocols, whois, in order
    to explore whether an extremely simple and widely-deployed protocol can succeed
    where more complex and powerful options have failed or been excessively delayed.
    This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. It does
    not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested.</p>"
