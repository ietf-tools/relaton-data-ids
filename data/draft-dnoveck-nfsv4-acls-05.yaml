abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the
    description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc5661bis respecification
    effort for NFv4.1. It describes the structure and function of Access Control Lists
    within all existing minor versions of NFSv4. It describes the structure of NFSv4
    ACLs and their role in the NFSv4 security architecture. While the focus of this
    document is on the role of ACLs in providing a more flexible approach to file
    access authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived authorization-related
    attributes, the potential provision of other security-related functionality is
    covered as well. [Consensus Needed (Item #117a)]: Because of the failure of previous
    specifications to provide a satisfactory approach to either of the two ACL models
    for which support was originally intended, this document clarifies the status
    of draft POSIX ACLs, with the expectation that support for these might be provided
    via a later extension. In addition, this document will include some small protocol
    extensions to correct protocol defects, as provided for in RFC8178. [Consensus
    Needed (Item #117a)]: In this document, the relationship among the multiple ACL
    models supported has changed. A core set of functionality, shared in large part
    with that derived from a subset of the functionality provided by the now-withdrawn
    draft POSIX ACLs is presented as the conceptual base of the feature set. Additional
    sets of features used to provide the functionality within the NFSv4 ACL model
    and the full draft POSIX ACL model are considered as OPTIONAL extensions to that
    core, with the latter not yet present in NFsv4.1. The current version of the document
    is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding repairing
    problems with previous specifications of ACL-related features and to enable work
    to provide a greater degree of interoperability than has been available heretofore.
    The drafts provide a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining working
    group consensus regarding necessary changes. When the resulting document is eventually
    published as an RFC, it will supersede the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics
    appearing in existing minor version specification documents for NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1,
    thereby updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.</p>"
