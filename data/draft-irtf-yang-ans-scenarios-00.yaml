abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines some common wireless ad hoc network usage scenarios
    that have the potential of being deployed as medium or large scale networks. The
    scenarios include both pure ad hoc networks without any infrastructure support
    and the hybrid networks with some infrastructure in place. This document is motivated
    by the effort in the IRTF ANS (Ad hoc Network Scalability) research group. The
    aim of this document is to provide some common network scenarios that are rooted
    in the real world deployment to facilitate meaningful investigation and research
    of scalability in ad hoc networks.</p>"
