abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the concept of Virtual Customer Premises Equipment
    (VCPE). Such concept was first proposed in Broadband Forum (BBF) as Network Enhanced
    Residential Gateway (NERG). The concept is further expanded as not only referring
    to virtual CPE of residential network, but all the virtual network and service
    functions shifted from the customer side to the operator side. Deployment of VCPE
    in some typical DMM (Distributed Mobility Management) scenarios brings specific
    requirements and even protocol extension in DMM. In this document, we will first
    explain the motivation and advantages of VCPE. A usecases of VCPE in the community
    Wi-Fi deployment is further discussed so as to explain the deployment of VCPE
    in a DMM scenario. Three models of field deployment of VCPE are discussed afterwards
    to indicate the possible CP/DP decomposition requirement and protocol extension.</p>"
