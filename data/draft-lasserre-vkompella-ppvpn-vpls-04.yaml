abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a virtual private LAN service (VPLS) solution
    over MPLS, also known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). A VPLS creates an emulated
    LAN segment for a given set of users. It delivers a layer 2 broadcast domain that
    is fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses that is
    closed to a given set of users. Many VPLS services can be supported from a single
    PE node. This document describes the control plane functions of signaling demultiplexor
    labels, extending [PWE3-CTRL] and rudimentary support for availability (multi-homing).
    It is agnostic to discovery protocols. The data plane functions of forwarding
    are also described, focusing, in particular, on the learning of MAC addresses.
    The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by [PWE3- ETHERNET].</p>"
