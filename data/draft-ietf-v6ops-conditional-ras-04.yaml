abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses the most common scenarios of connecting an enterprise
    network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned by an ISP. The problem
    of enterprise multihoming without address translation of any form has not been
    solved yet as it requires both the network to select the correct egress ISP based
    on the packet source address and hosts to select the correct source address based
    on the desired egress ISP for that traffic. The "ietf-rtgwg- enterprise-pa-multihoming"
    document proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a new routing functionality
    (Source Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue and using
    Router Advertisements to influence the host source address selection. While the
    above-mentioned document focuses on solving the general problem and on covering
    various complex use cases, this document describes how the solution proposed in
    the "ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa- multihoming" draft can be adopted for a limited
    number of common use cases. In particular, the focus is on scenarios where an
    enterprise network has two Internet uplinks used either in primary/backup mode
    or simultaneously and hosts in that network might not yet properly support multihoming
    as described in RFC8028.</p>
