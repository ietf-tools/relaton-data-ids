abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives the authors' opinion of a rough outline of (1)
    the problems to be addressed by the proposed IETF HTTP-NG Working Group; (2) the
    requirements on the solution; and (3) the architecture of the solution. It draws
    heavily on contributions from the whole Protocol Design Group of the W3C HTTP-NG
    Activity. A suite of problems should be addressed, summarized as observing that
    the World Wide Web's tremendous success has created some strains on the Internet,
    its users, and its application developers. The requirements on the solution include
    modularity, extensibility, scalability, and efficiency. The proposed solution
    is to factor HTTP, the Web's central protocol, into three layers and look into
    performance improvements in the lower two of those resultant layers.</p>"
