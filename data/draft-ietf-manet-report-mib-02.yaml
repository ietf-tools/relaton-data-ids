abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes objects for configuring autonomous report generation on any device
    that supports MIBs containing counter and gauge objects for performance monitoring.
    This allows a management station to instruct a device to build off-line reports
    to be collected asynchronously by the management station. Further, this REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB
    can be configured in a proxy configuration where the report generation is performed
    on a device in close network proximity to the device containing the referenced
    counter objects. Hence, this capability allows network operators to reduce the
    SNMP polling traffic burden on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Disruption Tolerant Networks
    which is typical of SNMP performance management applications.</p>"
