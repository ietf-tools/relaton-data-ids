abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP,
    termed "One-time Extended Community Outbound Route Filter", which would allow
    a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh request with a set of extended-community-based
    filters to make the peer re-advertise only the specific routes matching the filters
    to the speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to refresh some specific routes
    without requiring its peer to re- advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out, which makes
    the route refresh operation more efficient and reduces the impact on network stability.
    This filter does not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers and should
    only be used for one-time filtering.</p>
