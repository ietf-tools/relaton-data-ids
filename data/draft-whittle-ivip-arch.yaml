abstract:
- content: '<p>Ivip (Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing) is a Core-Edge Separation
    solution to the routing scaling problem, for both IPv4 and IPv6. It provides portable
    address "edge" address space which is suitable for multihoming and inbound traffic
    engineering (TE) to end-user networks of all types and sizes - in a manner which
    imposes far less load on the DFZ control plane than the only current method of
    achieving these benefits: separately advertised PI prefixes. Ivip includes two
    extensions for ITR-to-ETR tunneling without encapsulation and the Path MTU Discovery
    problems which result from encapsulation - one for IPv4 and the other for IPv6.
    Both involve modifying the IP header and require most DFZ routers to be upgraded.
    Ivip is a good basis for the TTR (Translating Tunnel Router) approach to mobility,
    in which mobile hosts retain an SPI micronet of one or more IPv4 addresses (or
    IPv6 /64s) no matter what addresses or access network they are using, including
    behind NAT and on SPI addresses. TTR mobility for both IPv4 and IPv6 involves
    generally optimal paths, works with unmodified correspondent hosts and supports
    all application protocols.</p>'
