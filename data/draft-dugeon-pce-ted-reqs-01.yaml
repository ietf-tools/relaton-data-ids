abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced
    a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation Element as a
    tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement. In the PCE architecture,
    a main assumption has been done concerning the information that the PCE needs
    to perform its computation: the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) contains all
    pertinent and suitable information regarding the network that is in the scope
    of a PCE. Nevertheless, the TED requirements as well as the TED information have
    not yet been formalized. In addition, some recent RFC (like the Backward Recursive
    Path Computation procedure) or WG draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy ...) suffer
    from a lack of information in the TED, leading to a non optimal result or to some
    difficulties to deploy them. This memo tries to identity some TED requirements
    for the PCE. It is split in two main section: the identification of the specific
    information to be stored in the TED and how it may be populated.</p>"
