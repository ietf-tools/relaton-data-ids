abstract:
- content: <p>The BIER Encapsulation RFC8296 specifies that the "Proto" field in the
    BIER header is set to 1 if an MPLS label stack follows the BIER header and the
    top of the stack label is a downstream-assigned label, and is set to 2 if the
    top of stack label is an upstream-assigned label, which is looked up in the context-specific
    label forwarding table that can be derived from the BIER header. The terms upstream/downstream-assignment
    are inappropriate to describe the required forwarding for new MPLS label semantics
    such as SRGB and DCB labels as defined in RFC8402 and RFC9573 respectively. This
    can result in potentially inconsistent implementation choices causing potential
    interoperability issues. This document rectifies this situation by changing the
    IANA BIER Next Protocol Identifier semantic for MPLS code points from their label
    semantic to the required LFIB in the forwarding plane, hence covering those new
    type of labels without changing behavior for existing upstream/downstream-assigned
    labels.</p>
