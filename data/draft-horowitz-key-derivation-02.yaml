abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent advances in cryptography have made it desirable to use longer
    cryptographic keys, and to make more careful use of these keys. In particular,
    it is considered unwise by some cryptographers to use the same key for multiple
    purposes. Since most cryptographic-based systems perform a range of functions,
    such as authentication, key exchange, integrity, and encryption, it is desirable
    to use different cryptographic keys for these purposes. This RFC does not define
    a particular protocol, but defines a set of cryptographic transformations for
    use with arbitrary network protocols and block cryptographic algorithm.</p>"
