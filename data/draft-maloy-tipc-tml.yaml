abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a ForCES [ForCES] Transport Mapping layer (TML)
    based on the Transparent Inter Process Communication service [TIPC]. It is intended
    to be used when the ForCES protocol is transported over L2 carriers such as Ethernet,
    RapidIO or PCI- Express. TIPC has been specially designed for efficient and easy-to-
    use communication over L2 carriers, and is typically used to define clusters of
    loosely coupled nodes in such environments.</p>"
