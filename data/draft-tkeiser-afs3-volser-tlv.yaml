abstract:
- content: <p>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed at
    Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s. AFS-3 heavily leverages Remote Procedure
    Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed architecture. This memo extends
    the volume management interface to support getting and setting of AFS volume attributes
    via an extensible Tag-Length-Value (TLV) encoding, which is based upon AFS-3 extensible
    discriminated unions. TLV-based get and set RPCs are specified, along with a tag
    enumeration RPC. In addition, tags are allocated for existing volume and transaction
    metadata, and implementation-private tags are allocated for metadata related to
    the OpenAFS Demand Attach File Server, and the RxOSD protocol suite. Internet
    Draft Comments Comments regarding this draft are solicited. Please include the
    AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org)
    as a recipient of any comments. AFS-3 Document State This document is in state
    "draft", as per the document state definitions set forth in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-standardisation].</p>
