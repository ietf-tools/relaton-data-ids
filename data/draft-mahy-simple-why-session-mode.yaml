abstract:
- content: <p>The SIMPLE working group describes one or more messages sent completely
    independently as "pager-mode" messages, whereas messaging associated with as part
    of a "session" with a definite start and end is called session mode messaging.
    The SIMPLE community has received numerous comments and complaints from the larger
    IM community that session mode is more complex than pager mode messaging. However,
    session mode messaging has a number of benefits which are not available in pager
    mode, but these benefits have not been widely articulated and this value is not
    well understood outside the SIP/ SIMPLE community. This document attempts to describe
    the benefits of session mode, such as explicit rendezvous, integration with other
    media, direct client-to-client operation, and brokered privacy and security, in
    an accessible manner.</p>
