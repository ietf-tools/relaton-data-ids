abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture framework for achieving converged
    mobile services across alternative radio access networks (GAN, or Generic Access
    Network), such as WLAN, WiMax, and the cellular network, while utilizing SIP for
    media session control between the dual mode handset (DMH) and a network SIP proxy.
    The key benefits of this architecture include (1) fast and flexible service deployment
    in the IP domain, and (2) allow seamless voice call continuity services across
    IP and circuit-switched cellular domains.</p>"
