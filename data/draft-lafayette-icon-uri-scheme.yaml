abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the "icon" URI scheme. Icons have a fundamental
    role in user interaction with computer operating systems. In a graphical user
    interface, they may represent a file, folder, application, or device. They live
    on the desktop, in toolbars, and in menus. Most operating systems provide a standard
    set of icons that match the look and feel of the system. The "icon" URI scheme
    lets web page designers leverage these existing platform icons.</p>
