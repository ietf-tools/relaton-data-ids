abstract:
- content: "<p>Nested MIP [NestMIP] provides a means to support both localization
    and aggregation of MIP signalling. It achieves this by providing two distinct
    layers of MIP signalling and forwarding; a local access layer that provides local
    mobility management and local access services, and a remote access layer that
    provides remote access back to a home subnet. The local access layer provides
    a regional address from a Regional Mobility Agent (a regional HA) that is then
    used as a CCoA for the remote access layer. Inter-FA movement and MIP signalling
    at the local access layer then automatically produces the hand-off of potentially
    multiple parallel remote access sessions. The consequences of this model are however
    reductions in bandwidth efficiency due to the additional layers of temporary and
    permanent encapsulation. This draft describes a complementary model for MIP forwarding,
    called Concatenated MIP that re-uses, and extends the localised and aggregated
    MIP signalling model from [NestMIP]. The enhanced forwarding model is intended
    to co-exist both with [NestMIP] and [RegTunMods] so that the appropriate trade-offs
    can be made on a per session basis between bandwidth efficiency and other features.
    Inter-RMA hand-offs between Nesting and Concatenating Regional Mobility Agents
    is also supported.</p>"
