abstract:
- content: "<p>In the DNS architecture, two kinds of record types for maintaining
    host's IP addresses are supported: one is A type which records IPv4 and AAAA for
    IPv6 addresses. This document defines a new TYPE, which is mainly used in queries
    in order to get both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The main advantage is to avoid sending
    several requests in order to resolve the location of a given resource. A single
    request may be sufficient. The proposed solution does not require the definition
    of any new record type.</p>"
