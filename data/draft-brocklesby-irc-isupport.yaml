- content: "<p>This memo presents a way for the server to unobtrusively advertise
    the ways in which it differs from the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) specification
    defined in RFC 1459 [6]. It is a primary goal to implement this in a way which
    is completely backwards-compatible with the original protocol, and also with current
    non-standard implementations of the ISUPPORT numeric.</p>"
