    in text strings, which means that a minimum of around 800 bytes of data are required
    before compression can occur. Most data fields in databases are far smaller than
    that, and therefore dictionary-based compression is not efficient. The method
    proposed begins by making assumptions about the data and accepting some compromises;
    which allows compression to begin from the very first byte. The discussion proves
    that this can result in 1) an average 30% compression, 2) a maximum 50% compression,
    and 3) no expansion at all (0%) of the input data. As an added benefit, all processing
    can be performed using bit shifting and masking, which drastically lowers the
    cost of compression; no division or multiplication operations are necessary. UTF-8
    text is handled gracefully. OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND The origin of RadX is the
    attempt by Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970''s to pack more text into
    the limited memory space available to computers in that era, particularly as DEC
    was supporting different classes of machines with different word sizes - some,
    like the PDP/8 series, were byte machines, but some used 32 or even 36 bits. DEC
    engineers basically used radix40 as the basis for a compressed character set which
    included the alphabet, the numerals, the space, and three other special characters
    (which varied by machine). They called it "RAD50", because in that era DEC were
    into octal arithmetic and every- thing was in three-bit groups. It worked - they
    packed three letters into every 16 bits (40 x 40 x 40 = 64000), but the glaring
    problem was that it didn''t work for anything but filenames - the character set
    was too small. There were also performance issues. Using non-binary bases for
    character sets is not kind to ALUs; lots of division, modulus and multiplication
    are involved. Those who designed UTF-8 to represent Unicode in a flexible and
    fool- proof way had a similar problem. They decided on an approach in which all
    transformations could use bit-shifting instead of divide and multi- ply. We have
    done the same, which implies, of course, sticking to binary bases and radices.
    DISCUSSION The best compression methods seek out redundancy in text - but in order
    to do that, the analyzer needs a sufficiently large sample, which some experts
    have determined needs to exceed 800 bytes for random text. The most elegant solutions
    generate dictionaries on-the-fly, requiring only one pass through the data. If
    this method does not serve, then the best alternative is to make some assumptions
    about the data before it is ever seen, perhaps even restrict the universe of permitted
    values, and then dive right into a compression procedure from the very first byte.
    UTF-8 solved many encoding problems - backward compatibility with ASCII being
    the most important, but no less important is the ability to recover from a bad
    byte or sequence error, to skip illegal segments which may have come from some
    other Unicode encoding scheme, and so on. But the recognition that an algorithm
    cannot be arrogantly wasteful of CPU cycles is what has made it possible to utilize
    it without having to worry about the cost. IMPLEMENTATION RadX is a useful combination
    of Radix-32/64 compression. The data is primarily stored in Radix-32, which allows
    bit-shifting instead of divi- ding/multiplying to greatly simplify computation.
    This is combined with a check for double characters, which can be encoded effectively
    in 4 bits. Other ASCII characters are stored in 6 bits; UTF-8 characters are reduced
    to bare Unicode and stored in 24 bits maximum. A series of zero bytes is used
    for padding. As the input string is scanned from left to right, all disallowed
    Uni- code ranges are ignored. Control characters are treated as spaces, and all
    spaces consolidated. If the character is UTF-8, the Unicode page number is simply
    substituted for pages 00 to 0F. For codes from U+0080 to U+0FFF, only the last
    8 bits need to be added, so an extra byte is used. For U+1000 onwards, two extra
    bytes are encoded. For safety, certain bit patterns are detected and skipped.
    If the character is not UTF-8, then it is simple ASCII - and Radix-32 compression
    is attempted. A special subset of 32 characters is defined as: " .0123456789ABCDEFGHILMNOPRSTUWY"
    These are space, period, the numerals, and the alphabet with the excep- tion of
    J, K, Q, V, X, and Z. The table indexing automatically upper- cases alphas and
    substitutes some punctuation. If doubled codes are found, Radix-64 encoding is
    used with a "double" flag; if three Radix- 32 encoding are found, that set is
    used; else a single Radix-64 byte is created. The bit allocation table below shows
    the final encodings. Bit allocation ============== 0 n xxxxxx Radix-64 ASCII,
    n=0 if doubled, 1 if single 0 000 0000 +2 bytes Unicode U+1000 to U+D7FF (or padding)
    0 011 1xxx +1 byte Unicode U+0080 to U+07FF 0 111 xxxx +1 byte Unicode U+0800
    to U+0FFF 0 111 1110 +1 byte Unicode repeats, diff. in last digit 0 111 1111 Identical
    repeat of entire last sequence 1 xxxxx yyyyy zzzzz Radix-32 triplet The great
    advantages of this system over DEC RAD50 are that 1) the computational overhead
    is low, since there is no need to use division and modulus repeatedly for each
    character - simple bit-shift is suffi- cient, and 2) there are no unmappable characters.
    The Internet requires UTF-8 support, and with RadX we can have our cake and eat
    it too; we can compress ASCII efficiently and yet not get fazed when UTF-8 unexpectedly
    pops up (or is introduced on purpose). In fact, quite a lot of UTF-8 is also compressed
    - Indic languages, for instance, such as Hindi and Tamil are also compressed by
    30%. The following ranges are mapped: U+0080 to U+024F, and U+0300 to U+D7FF.
    Codes outside those ranges are deleted. Codes from U+0080 to U+0FFF are mapped
    using one extra byte; from U+1000 onwards, two extra bytes are required. This
    still represents a savings, or at least no penalty: A. A UTF-8 character is found
    which is near or identical to the previous one. It is now stored in 8 bits. Compression
    = 3:1 to 2:1 (66% to 50%) B. Double ASCII character pair found, map to Radix-64.
    2 bytes are stored in 8 bits. Compression = 2:1 (50%) C. 3 characters found which
    map into Radix-32. 3 bytes are stored in 16 bits. Compression = 3:2 (33%) D. A
    UTF-8 character in the range U+0800 to U+0FFF is found; it occupies 3 byte in
    UTF-8. It is now stored in 16 bits. Compression = 3:2 (33%) E. An ASCII character
    is found, and mapped to Radix-64. 1 byte is stored in 8 bits. Compression = 1:1
    (0%) F. A UTF-8 character is found in the range U+0080 to U+07FF; it occupies
    2 bytes and is stored in 16 bits. Compression = 2:2 (0%) G. A UTF-8 character
    in the range U+1000 to U+D7FF occupies 3 bytes and is encoded in 24 bits. Compression
    = 3:3 (0%) That takes care of all the possible characters in ASCII and UTF-8.
    Any dangerous Unicode sequences are deleted as shown below. All the encodable
    sequences are first checked to see if they match the previous Unicode character;
    if they do, the single-byte Unicode repeat code is used. &lt;CODE BEGINS&gt; Bit

    to 55 are used for ASCII; 0 and 56 to 63 are reserved for Unicode encoding prefixes.

    [reverse Radix-32] &lt;CODE ENDS&gt; The fourth sequence above is used when the
    current UTF-8 and also the next one, are almost the same as the last but differ
    in the final hex digit. The fifth sequence above is used when the entire current
    encoding is identical to the last. Special processing is done for word beginnings
    which are lower case - the preceding Radix-64 space character''s "double" bit
    is set to indicate that the next letter should NOT be uppercased (0x20 vs. 0x60).
    (Double spaces are impossible, since they are eliminated before anything else.)
    The sequence 0x800? cannot normally occur, since that would represent the Radix-32
    sequence for two spaces in a row; so this allows for a set of 32 special codes
    which have not been allocated, any may be used for future extension. USAGE EXAMPLE
    And finally, here is a worst-case scenario with the famous full-alpha- bet sentence.
    T H E Q U I C K B R O W N ..20+8+5... 32 17 ..21+9+3... 11 ..0+2+18... ..15+23+14..
    F O X J U M P S O V E R ..0+6+15... 24 32 10 ..21+13+16.. ..19+0+15.. 22 ..5+18+0
    T H E L A Z Y D O G . ..20+8+5... ...0+12+1... 26 ..25+0+4... ..15+7+10.. The
    three-number groups represent a two-byte condensation in Rad-32, and the lone
    numbers represent a fallback to Rad-64 using one byte. The original 44-byte sentence
    is reduced to 32, or a 27% reduction even without any doubled characters. This
    letter frequency assumption works for all European languages, with a slight loss
    for German, Italian and Polish. RESULTING FEATURES The result of applying the
    above procedures to text strings gives the following advantages:</p>'
