abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a reference architecture for direct presentation
    flows of digital credentials. The architecture introduces the concept of a presentation
    mediator as the active component responsible for managing, presenting, and selectively
    disclosing credentials while preserving a set of security and privacy promises
    that will also be defined. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before
    publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found
