abstract:
- content: "<p>Pairing is a special map from two elliptic curves that called Pairing-friendly
    curves to a finite field and is useful mathematical tools for constructing cryptographic
    primitives. At CRYPTO 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed an efficient number field
    sieve algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem in a finite field. The security
    of pairing-based cryptography is based on the difficulty in solving the DLP. Hence,
    it has become necessary to shift the parameters that the DLP is computationally
    infeasible against the efficient number field sieve algorithms. This memo introduce
    Optimal Ate Pairing and two pairing-friendly curves with parameters of pairing
    against efficient number field sieve algorithms.</p>"
