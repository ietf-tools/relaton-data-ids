abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS fast reroute [3] is considered as a possible solution to protect
    traffic against link and node failures by re-directing the traffic locally to
    a backup LSP. A backup LSP can be either a detour LSP or a bypass tunnel. This
    document describes two methods to optimize the routing of detour LSPs such that
    they merge faster, a distributed method and a centralized method. The distributed
    method uses the Backup Record Route Object (BRRO) and the centralized method uses
    the Backup Explicit Route Object (BERO). The latter can also be used for bypass
    tunnels.</p>"
