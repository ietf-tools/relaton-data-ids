abstract:
- content: "<p>The confidentiality of encrypted data depends on the secrecy of the
    key needed to decrypt it. If one key is able to decrypt large quantities of data,
    its compromise will be disastrous. This memo describes three methods for limiting
    this vulnerability for OpenPGP messages: reducing the lifetime of confidentiality
    keys; one-time keys; and the additional use of lower-layer security services.</p>"
