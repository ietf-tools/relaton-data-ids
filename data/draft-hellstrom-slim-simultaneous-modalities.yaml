abstract:
- content: "<p>In a real-time communication session, there may be a need or preference
    for receiving the same content in two or more simultaneous modalities. This specification
    extends a mechanism for human language negotiation with a mechanism for indication
    of preference for, or the availability of, simultaneously provided transformations
    of original contents. This indication enables negotiation of simultaneous modalities
    in real-time sessions. Applications are for example provision of both spoken and
    written content in a real-time call (captioning), or provision of both spoken
    language original and sign language interpretation of the original language in
    a real-time session.</p>"
