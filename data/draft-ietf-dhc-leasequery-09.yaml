abstract:
- content: "<p>A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4) server is
    the authoritative source of IP addresses that it has provided to DHCPv4 clients.
    Other processes and devices that already make use of DHCPv4 may need to access
    this information. The leasequery protocol provides these processes and devices
    a lightweight way to access IP address information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
