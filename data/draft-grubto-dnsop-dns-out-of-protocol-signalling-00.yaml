abstract:
- content: "<p>This document seeks to specify a method for name servers to signal
    programs outside of the name server software, and which are not necessarily involved
    with the DNS protocol, about conditions that can arise within the name server.
    These signals can be used to invoke actions in areas that help provide the DNS
    service, such as routing. Currently this document serves as a requirements document
    to come to a signalling mechanism that will suit the use cases best. Part of that
    effort is to assemble a list of conditions with potential associated out of DNS
    protocol actions, as well as inventory and assess existing signalling mechanisms
    for suitability.</p>"
