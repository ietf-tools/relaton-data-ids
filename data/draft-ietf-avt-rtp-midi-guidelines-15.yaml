abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo offers non-normative implementation guidance for the Real-time
    Protocol (RTP) MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) payload format. The
    memo presents its advice in the context of a network musical performance application.
    In this application two musicians, located in different physical locations, interact
    over a network to perform as they would if located in the same room. Underlying
    the performances are RTP MIDI sessions over unicast UDP. Algorithms for sending
    and receiving recovery journals (the resiliency structure for the payload format)
    are described in detail. Although the memo focuses on network musical performance,
    the presented implementation advice is relevant to other RTP MIDI applications.
