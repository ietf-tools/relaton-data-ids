abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Network News Transport
    Protocol[RFC977] that allows NNTP peers to dynamically adjust their criteria for
    sending network news articles to one another. This extension provides only for
    the addition of 'negative' criteria, i.e., criteria for articles that are not
    to be sent. It is believed that a more comprehensive scheme allowing for 'positive'
    criteria, while desirable, would not receive wide deployment in the Internet because
    of concerns about security and intellectual property. The extension described
    in this document does not present these concerns and allows for gains in network
    efficiency.</p>"
