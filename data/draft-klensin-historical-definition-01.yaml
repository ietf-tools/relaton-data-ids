abstract:
- content: <p>The "Historical" category has been used to identify some documents in
    the RFC Series for many years, but has never been precisely defined except in
    various oral traditions. More important, with one exception that is now obsolete,
    the conditions under which documents should be reclassified as Historic and the
    procedures for doing so have never been defined, leading to a number of ad hoc
    and inconsistent actions. This document clarifies both the category and procedures
    for putting documents into it.</p>
