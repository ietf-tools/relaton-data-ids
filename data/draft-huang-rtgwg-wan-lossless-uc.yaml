abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the use cases and requirements for implementing
    lossless data transmission techniques in Wide Area Networks (WANs), motivated
    by the increasing demand for high- bandwidth and reliable data transport in applications
    such as high- performance computing (HPC), genetic sequencing, multimedia content
    production and distributed training. The challenges associated with existing data
    transport protocols in WAN environments are discussed, along with the proposal
    of requirements for enhancing lossless transmission capabilities to support emerging
    data-intensive applications.</p>"
