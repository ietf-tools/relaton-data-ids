abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities
    than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from distributed authoring,
    collaboration, and printing, to various remote procedure call mechanisms. The
    Protocol Extension Protocol (PEP) is an extension mechanism designed to address
    the tension between private agreement and public specification and to accommodate
    extension of applications such as HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The PEP
    mechanism is designed to associate each extension with a URI[2], and use a few
    new RFC 822[1] derived header fields to carry the extension identifier and related
    information between the parties involved in an extended transaction. This document
    defines PEP and describes the interactions between PEP and HTTP/1.1[7]. PEP is
    intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0[5] inasmuch as HTTP/1.1 is compatible
    with HTTP/1.0 (see [7], section 19.7). It is proposed that the PEP extension mechanism
    be included in future versions of HTTP. The PEP extension mechanism may be applicable
    to other information exchange not mentioned in this document. It is recommended
    that readers get acquainted with section 1.4 for a suggested reading of this specification
    and a list of sections specific for HTTP based applications.</p>"
