abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem protocol defines a key distribution
    protocol to provision an SSH server with user's public keys. However, that protocol
    is limited to provisioning an SSH server. This document describes a new protocol
    that builds on the protocol defined in RFC 4819 to allow the provisioning of keys
    and certificates to a server using the SSH transport. The new protocol allows
    the calling client to organize keys and certificates in different namespaces on
    a server. These namespaces can be used by the server to allow a client to configure
    any application running on the server (e.g., SSH, KMIP, SNMP). The new protocol
    provides a server-independent mechanism for clients to add public keys, remove
    public keys, add certificates, remove certificates, and list the current set of
    keys and certificates known by the server by namespace (e.g., list all public
    keys in the SSH namespace). Rights to manage keys and certificates in a specific
    namespace are specific and limited to the authorized user and are defined as part
    of the server's implementation. The described protocol is backward compatible
    to version 2 defined by RFC 4819.</p>"
