abstract:
- content: "<p>The Distributed Authoring and Versioning protocol [WEBDAV] defines
    simple mechanisms to assign and retrieve values for properties. This document
    presents scenarios for a WebDAV extension to support efficient searching for resources
    based on WEBDAV properties and content. These scenarios are intended to suggest
    some of the uses that DASL could be put to. This may in turn motivate decisions
    on what is essential to DASL and what may be considered extra.</p>"
