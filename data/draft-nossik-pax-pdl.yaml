abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes PAX Pattern Description Language (PDL). PAX
    is a special purpose language for definitions of filters (recognizers) for sequential
    inputs. The language is suitable for describing pattern matching criteria in policy-based
    networking devices such as QoS routers and switches, packet filters, RMON probes,
    traffic shapers, etc. It pro- vides consistent means of programming policy-based
    networking devices based on different hardware and software platforms. Programs
    written in PAX can be built incrementally, where elementary patterns can be used
    as building blocks for more complex ones. The language encourages modular and
    object-oriented design.</p>"
