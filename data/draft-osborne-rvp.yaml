abstract:
- content: "<p>Instant Messaging has recently emerged as a new and highly popular
    medium of communication over the Internet, driven by the desire of individuals
    to know instantly whether another individual is online, to be notified when another
    individual arrives online, and to send messages in ‘real time’. These are all
    special cases of the more general problem of Internet-wide notification. The RVP
    protocol, is designed to enable such notifications and messages across a loosely
    coupled (federated) constellation of servers. RVP is designed to address the need
    for notification in a secure, reliable and scaleable fashion. RVP encompasses
    the client-server and server-server interactions. RVP is related to the work done
    by the IETF Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol Working group (IMPP). This
    protocol is not intended to compete with the IMPP effort, but to inform the design
    process with an existing implementation. This document reflects the actual Microsoft
    Exchange 2000 implementation.</p>"
