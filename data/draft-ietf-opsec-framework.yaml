abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines work done and documents produced by the Operational
    Security Capabilities (OPSEC) Working Group. The goal of the working group is
    to codify knowledge gained through operational experience about feature sets that
    are needed to securely deploy and operate managed network elements providing transit
    services at the data link and IP layers. The intent is to provide clear, concise
    documentation of capabilities necessary for operating networks securely, to assist
    network operators in communicating their requirements to vendors, and to provide
    vendors with input that is useful for building more secure devices. The working
    group produced a list of capabilities appropriate for large Internet Service Provider
    (ISP) and Enterprise Networks. This work is intended to refine [RFC3871]. This
    document also provides guidance for the creation of profile documents which are
    lists of security features needed in specific operating environments.</p>"
