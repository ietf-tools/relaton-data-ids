abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast trees can be shared across sources (shared trees) or may
    be source-specific (shortest path trees). Inspired by recent interests in using
    shared trees for interdomain multicasting, we investigate the trade-offs among
    shared tree types and source specific shortest path trees, by comparing performance
    over both individual multicast group and the whole network. The performance is
    evaluated in terms of path length, link cost, and traffic concentration. We present
    simulation results over a real network as well as random networks under different
    circumstances. One practically significant conclusion is that member- or sender-centered
    trees have good delay and cost properties on average, but they exhibit heavier
    traffic concentration which makes them inappropriate as the universal form of
    trees for all types of applications.</p>"
