abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to debug customer reported
    problems and for regression testing if network or client software is upgraded.
    As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks,
    it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signalling will take between
    clients, and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end. This
    draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP protocol data
    unit (PDU, or a SIP message) that marks the PDU as a candidate for logging. Such
    marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by the
    network operator and not used in regular client signalling. However, such marking
    can be carried end-to-end including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates
    and terminates in different networks.</p>"
