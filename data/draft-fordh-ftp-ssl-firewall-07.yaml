abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses some of the issues with running FTP, secured
    with TLS as defined in [FTP-TLS], through firewalls. FTP is known to be a bit
    of a problem for firewalls (see [RFC-1579] for a discussion of normal FTP and
    firewalls). Some of the problems have been fixed by adding intelligence into the
    firewall. With secured FTP, where the control connection is encrypted, some of
    these techniques fail. Whilst this document confines itself to issues of FTP over
    TLS, the issues will probably be relevant for most secured FTP protocols that
    conform to [RFC-2228]. Some of the discussions will also be relevant to any protocol
    that firewalls do clever things with.</p>"
