abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper defines a new extension header-SRv6 Policy Key to focusing
    on the problems of timeliness and accuracy of controller-aware paths in SRv6 networks.
    The scheme enables network nodes to report path information to the controller
    by adding a path unique identifier to the message header, which ensures that the
    controller has a real-time and accurate picture of the SR path status. Even if
    the SID is lost in transmission or the controller is unable to monitor it in real
    time and accurately. This approach aims to network availability and O&amp;M efficiency
    of SDN, particularly in scenarios involving multi-path tunnel configurations and
    load balancing.</p>"
