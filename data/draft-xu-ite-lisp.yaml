abstract:
- content: "<p>EID-to-RLOC (Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locators) mapping system
    is one of the cornerstones for LISP (Location/Identifier Separation Protocol)
    networks. This document discusses one solution to support ingress traffic engineering
    by controlling the EID-to-RLOC mappings in LISP networks as response to dynamic
    network status.</p>"
