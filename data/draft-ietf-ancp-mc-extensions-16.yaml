abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the extensions to the Access Node Control Protocol
    (ANCP) (RFC 6320) required for support of the multicast use cases defined in the
    Access Node Control Protocol framework document (RFC 5851) and one additional
    use case described in this document. These use cases are organized into the following
    ANCP capabilities: o multicast replication initiated by the Network Access Server
    (NAS); o conditional access and admission control with white and black lists;
    o conditional access and admission control with grey lists; o bandwidth delegation;
    and o committed bandwidth reporting. These capabilities may be combined according
    to the rules given in this specification. This document updates RFC 6320 by assigning
    capability type 3 to a capability specified in this document and by changing the
    starting point for IANA allocation of result codes determined by IETF Consensus
    from 0x100 to 0x64.</p>"
