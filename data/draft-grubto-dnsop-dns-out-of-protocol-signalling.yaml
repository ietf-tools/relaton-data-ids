abstract:
- content: "<p>This document seeks to specify a method for DNS servers to signal programs
    outside of the server software, and which are not necessarily involved with the
    DNS protocol, about conditions that can arise within the server. These signals
    can be used to invoke actions in areas that help provide the DNS service, such
    as routing. Currently this document serves as a requirements document to come
    to a signalling mechanism that will suit the use cases best. Part of that effort
    is to assemble a list of conditions with potential associated out of DNS protocol
    actions, as well as inventory and assess existing signalling mechanisms for suitability.</p>"
