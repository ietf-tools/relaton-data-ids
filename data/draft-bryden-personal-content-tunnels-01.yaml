abstract:
- content: "<p>As broadband access networks begin to mature, applications such as
    video-on-demand, application hosting and gaming are becoming viable service offerings.
    In order to provide these types of service, it is necessary to have extremely
    granular bandwidth control to ensure that user session traffic has a highly predictable
    traffic delivery profile. The Personal Content Tunnel framework provides this
    control in a session-oriented subscriber-driven manner allowing the most efficient
    use of access network bandwidth.</p>"
