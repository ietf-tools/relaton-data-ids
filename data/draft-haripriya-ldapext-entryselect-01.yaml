abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an LDAPv3 control that can select multiple entries
    in a subtree of a container entry for modification or deletion. This control extends
    the scope of the LDAPv3 modify and delete operations as defined in [RFC 2251].
    This control is useful for modifying or deleting multiple entries on the basis
    of a single selection criterion. This may be useful for maintenance of an LDAP
    directory having a large number of objects. Example of Usage - This control can
    be used by client applications who have the need to modify or delete a large number
    of entries in an LDAP directory based on a selection criterion. One example of
    such a usage is when two departments in an organization merge. In this case the
    'department' name or number given to a number of employees need to change, and
    all the employees in a given department are to be assigned the new 'department'.
    Here the EntrySelection control can be used to select the entries to be modified
    based on the 'department' value, and the modify operation can change the 'department'
    value for all the selected entries to the given value.</p>"
