abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, network equipment already has some Northbound Interfaces,
    such as SNMP, NETCONF, TL1; and some languages are also provided to describe the
    data model, such as MIB, SCHEMA and even YANG. While till now, there is not a
    clear defined information model. In NETCONF domain, some standards are being defined.
    In order to reduce the cost of NMS integration in customer side, a clear defined
    information model is necessary, just like the SID in TMF.</p>"
