abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
    contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) management information. The intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs)
    will be imported and used in MPLS related MIB modules that would otherwise define
    their own representations. This document obsoletes RFC3811 as it addresses the
    need to support IPv6 extended TunnelID's by defining a new TC- MplsNewExtendedTunnelID
    which suggests using an IPv4(for dual stack network) / IPv6 (for IPv6-only network)
    address of the ingress or egress LSR for the tunnel for dual stack network or
    an IPv6-only network. This document also fixed the confusing part of MplsLSPID.
    Changes from RFC3811 and the effect of the new TC to other related documents are
    summarized in Section 4 and 5, respectively.</p>"
