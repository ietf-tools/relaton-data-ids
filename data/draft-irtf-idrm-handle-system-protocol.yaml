abstract:
- content: "<p>The Handle System is a general-purpose global name service that allows
    secured name resolution and administration over the public Internet. The Handle
    System manages handles, which are unique names for digital objects and other Internet
    resources. This document specifies the protocol used between handle system clients
    and servers for handle resolution and administration. The document assumes that
    readers are familiar with the basic concepts of the Handle System as introduced
    in the 'Handle System Overview' [1], as well as the data model and service definition
    given in the 'Handle System Namespace and Service Definition' document [2].</p>"
