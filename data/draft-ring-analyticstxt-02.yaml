abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet privacy has become an important feature for users of websites
    and services. This document proposes a way for websites and services to declare
    and disclose their usage of analytics and tracking software. analytics.txt aims
    to be an elaborate file format that describes the privacy related characteristics
    of analytics and tracking software in a non-biased way. An analytics.txt file
    is understandable for a non-technical audience, while also useful for the automated
    consumption by tools and software.</p>"
