abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a data-plane in-band active measurement method
    for SRv6. A packet containing an SRH uses a flag bit to indicate it is an active
    probing packet. The measurement information, such as the IOAM header and data,
    is encapsulated in UDP payload. The probing packet originates from a segment source
    node and terminates at a configured segment endpoint node. Each segment node on
    the path, when detecting the flag, parses the UDP header and the payload. In case
    of IOAM, the node adds data to the IOAM node data fields. The method avoids the
    performance and encapsulation issues for applying IOAM as well as other measurement
    techniques in SRv6 networks. Multiple applications can be supported by the method.</p>"
