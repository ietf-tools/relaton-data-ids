abstract:
- content: "<p>Many newly proposed Source Address Validation (SAV) mechanisms such
    as IGP-based and BGP-based SAVNET solutions take a distributed manner to generate
    SAV rules, but they are faced with accuracy and managability challenges in incremental/partial
    deployment scenarios. This document proposes a network controller-based solution
    for enhancing SAVNET capability in intra-domain and inter-domain networks, which
    supports accurate verification, automated configuration, threat analysis, traceability
    and visualization.</p>"
