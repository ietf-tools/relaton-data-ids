abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the uniform expression and format of different
    kinds of wireless radio frequency fingerprints. It also specifies the structure
    and functions of wireless authentication framework on fingerprints, including
    the specification of the signal frames' structure. This document is applicable
    to the construction and management of secure access at the edge of the Internet
    of things. This document assumes that the reader is familiar with some concepts
    and details regarding physical layer security.</p>"
