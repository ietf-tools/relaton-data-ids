abstract:
- content: "<p>Two problems with BCP 78 regarding the outbound rights granted to third
    parties are identified. A proposal to solve the problems is proposed. The first
    problem is that rights granted to third parties in BCP 78 are more restrictive
    then what was permitted through the license in RFC 2026. The rights granted by
    the new license is too limited for some uses of Contributions. The uses include
    adapting portions of Contributions for online help, reference manuals, and source
    code. The second problem is that rights to publish and distribute documents are
    not granted to third parties. We also discuss an issue that has been expressed
    regarding fake RFCs, that might have been permitted through our earlier license,
    and we also attempt to solve that problem.</p>"
