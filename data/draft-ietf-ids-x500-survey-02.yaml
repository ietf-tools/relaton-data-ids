    using X.500 in ways which extend the view of X.500 as a "White Pages" service.
    This RFC is a product of the Integrated Directory Services Working Group of the
    Application and User Services Areas of the IETF. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>
