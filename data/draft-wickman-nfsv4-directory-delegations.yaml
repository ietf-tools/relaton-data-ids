abstract:
- content: "<p>NFS version 4 (NFSv4) introduces the use of file delegations to improve
    the ability of clients to cache file data and to provide locks in certain sharing
    environments without performing a round-trip communication to the server. Directory
    caching in NFSv4, however, is similar to previous versions and generates unnecessary
    revalidation traffic to maintain consistency weaker than delegations can provide.
    This document addresses the issues involved in providing a directory delegation
    mechanism and specifies a new operation, REQUEST_DELEGA- TION, to enable directory
    delegations.</p>"
