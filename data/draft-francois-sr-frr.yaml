abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a Fast Reroute approach aimed at providing link
    protection of nodal and adjacency segments to the Segment Routing framework. This
    FRR behavior builds on proven IP-FRR concepts being LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA),
    and remote LFAs with directed forwarding (DLFA). We describe their implementation
    using SR segments. We then analyze the benefits brought by Segment Routing to
    the scalability of such IP-FRR approaches.</p>"
