abstract:
- content: "<p>An OAuth 2.0 client requires specific information to interact with
    an authorization server, including a client identifier issued by that server.
    The OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591] defines a mechansim
    for dynamic client registration that removes the need for manual registration.
    This provides a more scalable mechanism that can be used by clients that do not
    have a pre-existing relationship with an authorization server, or where manually
    configuring such relationships is prohibitive from a cost and scale perspective.
    Examples of deployments that benefit from dynamic client registration includes
    modern cloud architectures where microservices are created on demand to meet scale
    requirements or for use with emerging protocols like the Model Context Protocol
    (MCP) [MCP] which requires clients to register with an authorization server even
    if they do not have a predefined relationship with the authorization server. Similar
    to modern cloud native workloads, MCP service integrations may be ephemeral in
    nature. The OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591] defines a
    software statement that includes metadata about the client and is signed by a
    developer or trusted third party. This specification describes the use of specific
    third party credentials issued to workloads and applications as software statements.
    The specification describes two types of credentials that may be used as software
    statements. The first is Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE)
    credentials. The second is the use of JWT representation of a Verifiable Credentials
    [VC-JWT]</p>"
