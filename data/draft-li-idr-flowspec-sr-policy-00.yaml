abstract:
- content: "<p>Flowspec, an extension to BGP, enables the dissemination of traffic
    flow specification rules and can be used to steer traffic into SR Policy. However,
    existing approaches using Flowspec to direct traffic into a SR Policy have certain
    drawbacks (for details, refer to section 1). This document difines two new standard
    actions for the BGP Flowspec V2 protocol (FSv2) [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-v2]: Redirect
    to SR Policy Action and SRv6 SID Action. The former allows traffic to be directed
    to a designated SR Policy, while the latter enables the encapsulation of an additional
    SRv6 SID as needed during redirection. These extensions address the shortcomings
    of existing solutions.</p>"
