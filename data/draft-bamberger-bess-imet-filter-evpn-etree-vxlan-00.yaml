abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 8317 defines EVPN Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) and associated filtering
    rules for both known unicast and broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM)
    traffic, using Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) encapsulation. The processes
    and protocols specified in RFC 8317 for performing E-Tree filtering on known unicast
    traffic are implemented entirely with EVPN routes, and are thus also applicable
    to networks using Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) encapsulation. However, E-Tree
    filtering for BUM traffic is accomplished using specific features of MPLS encapsulation,
    and is thus not applicable for networks using VXLAN encapsulation. In networks
    where E-Tree root/leaf role classification is done per- provider edge (PE) device,
    or per-attachment circuit (AC) on each PE device, an extension to EVPN type-3
    inclusive multicast (IMET) routes can be added to allow E-Tree filtering for BUM
    traffic in networks using VXLAN encapsulation. Additionally, this proposal specifies
    filtering BUM traffic on ingress, as opposed to the egress filtering specified
    by RFC 8317, which can be considered to be more optimal, as it reduces the amount
    of unnecessary BUM traffic transmitted over the network.</p>"
