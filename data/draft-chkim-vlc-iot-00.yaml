abstract:
- content: "<p>The LED-based Visible Light Communication (VLC) has been proposed as
    the IEEE 802.15.7-2011 standard and regarded as a new wireless access medium in
    IoT environment. With this trend, many works have so far been made to improve
    the performance of VLC. However, how to effectively integrate VLC services into
    IoT networks has not been studied enough. In this document, we propose a scheme
    for device management and data transport in IoT networks using VLC. Specifically,
    we discuss how to manage VLC transmitters and receivers, and to support VLC data
    transmission in IoT networks. The proposed scheme considers uni-directional VLC
    transmissions from transmitter to receivers for delivery of location-based VLC
    data. The backward transmission from VLC receivers will be made by using platform
    server and aggregation agents in the network.</p>"
