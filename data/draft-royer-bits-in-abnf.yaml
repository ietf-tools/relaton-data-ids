abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an extension to the ABNF specification to allow for bits definitions
    to be defined. When interacting with hardware or bit oriented over the wire protocols
    ABNF is not currently the choice. This specification describes a method to add
    boolean and narrow bit values in order to fix that limitation. And this note while
    in in draft status: A new Open Source XDR [RFC4506] and ABNF generation tool is
    being developed [xdrgen] which generates code from ABNF and XDR. It can also generate
    ABNF from XDR. And it can generate XDR from ABNF. Both also can produce C++ source
    and header files.</p>"
