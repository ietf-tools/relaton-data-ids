abstract:
- content: '<p>fixed size m (= 256 bits). But this data structure may be implemented
    in several different ways, for instance as a set of tables representing the currently
    relevant parts of the tree. We use a sequence of integer numbers as indexes for
    the nodes (values) in the tree. To avoid parentheses, commas, and semicolons we
    write for instance: "123" for the sequence of 3 numbers "1", "2", and "3". In
    what follows, in all our examples of integer sequences, we will not use numbers
    that require 2 or more digits (that is, numbers &gt; 9). The sequences of integers
    are used to index values in a tree: x_a is the value at the node with position
    (address) a. In other words, the nodes (and their values) are denoted as x_a,
    where a is a sequence of integer numbers. The tree has a root x (x_a where a =
    epsilon is the empty sequence). The children of x are x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_N,
    where k = 1..N is a singleton list, that is a list with only one number. If x_a
    is a node in the tree, then the children of x_a all have the form x_a'', where
    a''=a;i is a the concatenation of a and an integer i. The value x_a''= x_a; i=x_(a;i)
    is calculated as G(x_a,i). In the case of a hash h:</p>'
