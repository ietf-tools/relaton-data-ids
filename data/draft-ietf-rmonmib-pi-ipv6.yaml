abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier
    examples for IP version 6 and MPLS protocols. These can be used to produce valid
    protocolDirTable ``INDEX`` encodings, as defined by the Remote Network Monitoring
    MIB (Management Information Base) Version 2 [RFC2021] and the RMON Protocol Identifier
    Reference [RFC2895]. This document contains additional (to those in RFC 2896)
    protocol identifier macros for well-known protocols. A conformant implementation
    of the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] can be accomplished without the use of these protocol
    identifiers, and accordingly, this document does not specify any IETF standard.
    It is published to encourage better interoperability between RMON-2 agent implementations,
    by providing RMON related IPv6 and MPLS protocol information. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
