abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use cases of communication considering
    sleepy nodes and the problems of connecting to sleepy nodes in constrained node
    networks. The use cases of communications between sleepy nodes and non-sleepy
    nodes are classified by the end-to-end communication and the network topology.
    The adopt of power saving in constrained nodes raises compelling problems in network
    layer/ transport/application layer. In this document, problems of each layer in
    a sleepy node are described.</p>"
