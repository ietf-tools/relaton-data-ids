- content: "<p>IP Mobility support for IPv4 [RFC3344] defines a short and skippable
    extension header format intended to extend the Mobile IP extension address space.

    for configuration options, which SHOULD be used by any Mobile IP entity to exchange
    information of the network entities like DNS server address, previous Foreign
    Agent (FA) address, address of a session manager etc.</p>"
