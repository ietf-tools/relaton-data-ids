- content: "<p>This document analyzes the issues involved in the Distinguished Name-
    spaces of autonomous to loosely-coupled, LDAP-based directory services (LLDSs).
    It folds in experience learned from the global X.500-based Dis- tinguished Name-space,
    and proposes requirements for the construction of Distinguished Names for LLDSs
    of varying scopes.</p>"
