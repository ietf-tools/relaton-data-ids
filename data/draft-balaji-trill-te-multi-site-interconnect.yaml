abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the control plane procedures to support Traffic
    Engineering (TE) across TRILL sites where such sites are interconnected using
    [1] with the help of a Layer 3 core running IP+GRE or IP+MPLS. Traffic Engineering
    permits usage of a set of links that possess a certain characteristic like specified
    bandwidth, cost or even MTU. This draft aims at addressing how unicast frames
    travelling from one TRILL site to another across a Layer 3 core that supports
    IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS can make use of the TE calculated paths in the sending site
    as well as the receiving site where such TE paths are pre-computed in both sites
    and need a mechanism to inter- link them together.</p>"
