abstract:
- content: "<p>In various network deployments, end to end forwarding paths are partitioned
    into multiple segments. For example, in some cloud-based WAN communications, stitching
    multiple overlay tunnels are used for traffic policy enforcement matters such
    as to optimize traffic distribution or to select paths exposing a lower latency.
    Likewise, in satellite communications, the communication path is decomposed into
    two terrestrial segments and a satellite segment. Such long- haul paths are naturally
    composed of multiple network segments with various encapsulation schemes. Packet
    loss may show different characteristics on different segments. Traditional transport
    protocols (e.g., TCP) respond to packet loss slowly especially in long-haul networks:
    they either wait for some signal from the receiver to indicate a loss and then
    retransmit from the sender or rely on sender's timeout which is often quite long.
    Non-congestive loss may make the TCP sender over-reduce the sending rate unnecessarily.
    With the increase of end-to-end transport encryption (e.g., QUIC), traditional
    PEP (performance enhancing proxy) techniques such as TCP splitting are no longer
    applicable. LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) is a network-assisted
    performance enhancement over path segment and it aims to provide local in-network
    recovery to achieve better data delivery by making packet loss recovery faster
    and by avoiding the senders over-reducing their sending rate. In an overlay network
    scenario, LOOPS can be performed over a variety of the existing, or purposely
    created, tunnel-based path segments.</p>"
