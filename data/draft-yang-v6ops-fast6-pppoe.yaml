abstract:
- content: "<p>Although there have already been some transition solutions and technologies,
    it is still lack of a complete solution for large scale broadband ISPs based on
    the network architecture considering service providers' requirements and constraints
    in the real world. This document proposes an IPv6 transitioning architecture,
    the FAST6, which is based on the common broadband network architecture and providing
    IPv6 transition solutions going through the whole transition period.</p>"
