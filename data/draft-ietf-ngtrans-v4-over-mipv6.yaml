abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we show how IPv4 based communications can be supported
    by a dual stack mobile node that only supports Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). The aim is
    to use MIPv6 for mobility services while the Mobile can still use its dual stack
    capabilities for IPv4 communications without the need for translation.</p>"
