abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile nodes enhance the performance of their connections across wireless
    media by establishing various kinds of state (context), in order to use the available
    bandwidth securely and economically. During handover from one access router to
    another, a bandwidth-constrained mobile node needs to have state information passed
    from the previous router to the new one. This document proposes a framework for
    control structures that enable authorized context transfers. We demonstrate how
    the proposed framework could be applied during handovers so that the applications
    running on the mobile node could operate with minimal disruption, by reducing
    latency and packet losses</p>"
