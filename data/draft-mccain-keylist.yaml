abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client may subscribe
    to an organization's public keylist to keep its keystore up-to-date with correct
    keys from the correct keyserver(s), even in cases where the keys correspond to
    multiple (potentially uncontrolled) domains. Ensuring that all members or followers
    of an organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP public keys is critical
    to maintaining operational security. Without the most recent keys' fingerprints
    and a source of trust for those keys (as this document specifies), users must
    manually update and sign each others' keys -- a system that is untenable in larger
    organizations. This document proposes a experimental format for the keylist file
    as well as requirements for clients who wish to implement this experimental keylist
    subscription functionality.</p>"
