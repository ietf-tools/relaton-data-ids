abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a position paper. It documents the author's personal views
    on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in ICN protocols
    like CCNx or NDN which employ flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop
    forwarding state as their fundamental machinery. It argues that such protocols
    demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP, and
    proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification and differentiated
    QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis. It also considers the effect
    of caches as a resource in addition to memory, CPU and link bandwidth that should
    be subject to explicitly un-fair resource allocation. The proposed methods are
    intended to operate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed
    to achieve both transport and higher layer QoS objectives. It explicitly excludes
    any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE) which can only be assessed and controlled
    at the application layer or above.</p>"
