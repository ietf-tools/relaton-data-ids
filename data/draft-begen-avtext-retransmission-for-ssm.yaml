abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes RTP retransmission for source-specific multicast
    (SSM) architectures with unicast feedback. RTP payload format for retransmissions
    has been defined in RFC 4588, whereas the RTP profile an RTP receiver could use
    to issue RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback messages and the format of these
    feedback messages have been defined in RFC 4585. RFC 5760 defines the operation
    for SSM architectures with unicast feedback. First, we document potential issues
    that could arise when providing a retransmission service using RTP retransmission
    (RFC 4588 and RFC 4585) for RFC 5760 architectures based on rules described in
    the relevant RFCs. We then present solutions that allow to avoid unnecessary feedback
    suppression, provide enhanced retransmission services and address congestion control
    for retransmission in an SSM environment. These solutions specify certain rules
    that apply to the distribution source, feedback target(s), retransmission source(s)
    and RTP receivers.</p>"
