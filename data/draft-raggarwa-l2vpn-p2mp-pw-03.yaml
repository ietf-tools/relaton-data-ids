abstract:
- content: <p>A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) is a mechanism that emulates
    the essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such
    as P2MP ATM over a Packet Switched Network (PSN). One of the applicabilities of
    a P2MP PW is to deliver a Layer 2 multicast service, that carries multicast frames
    (encoded using Layer 2 or IP mechanisms) from a multicast source to one or more
    multicast receivers. [RFC4664] describes a number of different ways in which sets
    of PWs may be combined together into "Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs" (L2 PPVPNs,
    or L2VPNs), resulting in a number of different kinds of L2VPN. P2MP PWs enable
    a L2VPN to provide a Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS), which may be in
    addition to the Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) offered by the L2VPN. A VPMS
    is a L2VPN service that provides point-to-multipoint connectivity traffic to customers.
    VPMS framework and requirements are described in [VPLS-REQ]. One of the VPMS requirements
    is auto-discovery. This document describes how procedures outlined in [VPLS-MCAST]
    can be used for auto-discovery (A-D) in VPMS using BGP. This document also describes
    BGP based procedures for P2MP PW signaling for VPMS that may be used when BGP
    is used for VPMS auto-discovery.</p>
