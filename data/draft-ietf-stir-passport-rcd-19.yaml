abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying cryptographically-signed
    call information about personal communications, to include rich meta-data about
    a call and caller that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted, and
    subsequently rendered to the called party. This framework is intended to include
    and extend caller and call specific information beyond human-readable display
    name comparable to the "Caller ID" function common on the telephone network and
    is also enhanced with a integrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring
    and transport of this information for different authoritative use-cases.</p>
