abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently Mobile IP WG is carrying out very interesting work in the
    area of Fast/Low latency handoffs for Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4. The high level
    goal of this work is to reduce the latency during the change of point of attachement
    to the Internet (AKA Handoff) This document discusses one simple case that in
    the author's opinion is very common and can be optimized to achevie lower latency
    than that proposed by the various solutions. This scenario applies to both IPv6
    and IPv4 work. The solution at a high level is the same, but realization will
    be different as the frame work in IPv6 case is different from that of the IPv4
    case.</p>"
