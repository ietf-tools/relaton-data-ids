abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines dynamic paging area configuration extensions
    to IP paging. The motivation is three fold: First, paging areas are auto-configured,
    hence human effort is minimized. Second, paging area shapes adapt to host mobility
    characteristics, hence more efficient. Third, paging area sizes are variable,
    allowing future optimization. Dynamic paging area configuration can be regarded
    as the major advantage of having L3 paging areas.</p>"
