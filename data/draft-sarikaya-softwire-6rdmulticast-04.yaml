abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts can
    receive multicast data from IPv6 servers. In 6rd encapsulation solution, multicast
    communication is completely integrated into 6rd tunnel. 6rd Customer Edge router
    is extended with Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol Proxy entity. MLD
    Proxy receives join requests from 6rd IPv6 hosts and sends them upstream in 6rd's
    IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel to 6rd Border Relay (BR). This tunnel is used to exchange
    MLD messages to establish multicast state at 6rd BR so that 6rd BR can use 6rd's
    IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel to send IPv6 multicast data to 6rd CEs. At the CEs, multicast
    data is decapsulated and MLD Proxy delivers it to IPv6 hosts based on MLD group
    membership state. In 6rd Translation Multicast based solution, the protocol is
    based on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router and then translating MLD
    messages to IGMP messages and sending them upstream to a network which supports
    IPv4 multicast. 6rd Border Relay is multicast router and IGMP-MLD translator.
    It translates IGMP join back to MLD join message and sends it to multicast source.
    IPv6 Multicast data received at 6rd Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast
    data and then sent to IPv4 multicast tree downstream to 6rd Customer Edge which
    translates back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers to the hosts.</p>"
