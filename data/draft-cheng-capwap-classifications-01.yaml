abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes classifications for wireless local area network
    (WLAN) functionality. The main benefit of a consistent system of classification
    is accommodating the diversity of WLAN designs as seen in the Control and Provisioning
    of Wireless Access Points framework. This draft describes policies with which
    classifications may be used. The document analyzes various WLAN architectures
    and recent standardization efforts to derive key requirements for a CAPWAP WLAN
    protocol. It is envisioned that protocol development based on these requirements
    will enable interoperability among the various WLAN designs.</p>"
