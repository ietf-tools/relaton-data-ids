abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called
    DNS-based malware protection services deployed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
    DNS Application Service Providers (ASPs), and other organizations. These organizations
    provide so-called DNS-based malware protection services via their recursive DNS
    servers. This document specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where these
    DNS servers are being utilized to provide a service for end users which blocks
    domains hosting malicious software, and makes recommendations concerning operation
    of such a service.</p>"
