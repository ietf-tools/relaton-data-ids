abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the current thinking of the collaborators of
    ITU-T Question 10/2, 'Management and development of PSTN-based telecommunication
    services,' about service principles when public circuit switched international
    telecommunication networks interwork with IP-based networks. This document contains
    most of the text (there has been some rearrangement of the text) from draft new
    Recommendation E.370 [1], starting from section 3 of this Internet Draft, which
    was determined to be stable at the March 2000 meeting of Study Group 2. It may
    be approved by the members of the ITU, subject to written comments received from
    those members, at a meeting of the Study Group (or its successor) in early 2001
    (provisionally 23-26 January 2001). It is hoped that this document will further
    the collaborative efforts between Study Group 2 and the various working groups
    of the IETF.</p>"
