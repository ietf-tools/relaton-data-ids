abstract:
- content: "<p>This Document proposes two extension schemes of PMIPv6, called Query-based
    PMIPv6 (QPMIPv6) and Signaling Query-based PMIPv6 (S- QPMIPv6), which send the
    binding query messages to LMA to get the care-of-address of a mobile node and
    to deliver the subsequent data packet over optimized data path. The proposed two
    schemes have some differences with each other. We will show that the performances
    of the schemes comparing PMIPv6 with QPMIPv6 and S-QPMIPv6.</p>"
