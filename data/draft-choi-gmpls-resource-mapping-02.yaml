abstract:
- content: "<p>The new forms of label used in GMPLS to deal with the widening scope
    of MPLS into the optical and time domain are collectively referred to as a 'Generalized
    Label' related to resource. In this draft, we describe the relationship of labels
    and resources. We also describe the resource mapping methods for GMPLS with heterogeneous
    interfaces. Particularly we present the methods for resource mapping at incoming
    and outgoing switching interface where data flows with label of a different granularity
    are aggregated into the data flow of large bandwidth.</p>"
