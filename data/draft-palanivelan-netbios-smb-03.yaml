abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed in the
    early 1980s to allow applications to communicate over a network. The TCP/IP version
    called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT), was developed to support communications between
    symbolically named stations and transfer of arbitrary data.NetBT supports all
    three services (Name, Datagram and Session) supported by NetBIOS. The Server Message
    Block (SMB) is a presentation layer protocol providing file and print sharing
    functions for LAN Manager, and other network operating systems. SMB over NetBT
    session is not clearly explained in the RFCs [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios specification]
    and this document attempts to provide information on this. This document is intended
    for documentation purpose and for informational use only.This document does not
    attempt to define a standard, rather tries explaining an existing implementation.
    This document puts together pieces of information scattered in multiple documents
    and offers a single complete documentation for this specific application (smb
    over NetBT).</p>"
