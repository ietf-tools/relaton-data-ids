abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP option space is scarce resource as its max length is limited to
    40 bytes. This limitation becomes more significant in SYN segments as all options
    used in a connection should be exchanged during SYN negotiations. This document
    proposes a new SYN option negotiation scheme that can aggregate multiple TCP options
    in SYN segments into a single option so that more options can be negotiate during
    3 way handshake. With its simple design, the approach does not require fundamental
    changes in TCP.</p>"
