    IPv6 specification [MIPv6]. A subsequent effort[MIPv6SecReq] details the security
    threats introduced byMIPv6. Two major issues are (1) how to obtain a securityassociation
    between an arbitrary MN and CN such that thebinding update (BU) is secure, and,
    assuming such a mechanismis in place, (2) how to secure the individual BU messages.This
