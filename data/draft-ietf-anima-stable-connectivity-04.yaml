abstract:
- content: "<p>OAM (Operations, Administration and Maintenance - as per BCP161, [RFC6291])
    processes for data networks are often subject to the problem of circular dependencies
    when relying on connectivity provided by the network to be managed for the OAM
    purposes. Provisioning during device/network bring up tends to be far less easy
    to automate than service provisioning later on, changes in core network functions
    impacting reachability may not be easy to be automated either because of ongoing
    connectivity requirements for the OAM, and widely used OAM protocols are not secure
    enough to be carried across the network without security concerns. This document
    describes how to integrate OAM with the autonomic control plane (ACP) in Autonomic
    Networks (AN) to provide stable and secure connectivity for conducting OAM. This
    connectivity is not subject to aforementioned circular dependencies.</p>"
