abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 4684 defines Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP) procedures that allow
    BGP speakers to exchange Route Target reachability information which can be used
    to build a route distribution graph in order to limit the propagation of Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) between different
    autonomous systems or distinct clusters of the same autonomous system. However,
    according to RFC 4684, in some scenarios, more routes will be sent than need to
    be sent. This document extends RFC 4684. This extension allows a BGP speaker to
    advertise VPN routes more precisely.</p>"
