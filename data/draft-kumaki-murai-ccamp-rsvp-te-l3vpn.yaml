abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between sites
    across an IP backbone. These VPNs can be supported using BGP/MPLS and the connections
    can be created by using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
    New RSVP-TE extensions are required to support multiple MPLS-TE based BGP/MPLS
    IP-VPNs that are interconnected via the same Provider Edge (PE) routers. These
    extensions are necessary so that RSVP control messages from the Customer Edge
    (CE) equipment, such as Path messages and Resv messages, are appropriately handled
    by the PE routers. This document defines the procedure and objects that enable
    a PE router to distinguish between BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs.</p>"
