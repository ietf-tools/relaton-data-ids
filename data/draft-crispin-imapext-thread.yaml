abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the server-based threading extension to the
    IMAP4rev1 protocol. This extension provides substantial performance improvements
    for IMAP clients which offer threaded views. A server which supports this extension
    indicates this with more or more capability names consisting of 'THREAD-' followed
    by a supported threading algorithm name as described in this document. This provides
    for future upwards-compatible extensions.</p>"
