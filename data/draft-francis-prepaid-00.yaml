abstract:
- content: "<p>Prepaid voice services have proven to be extremely successful. There
    is a desire to replicate this success for data services. Prepaid for data presents
    new technical challenges, primarily due to the wide range of billing that may
    be applied to data services--- volume or time billing, differential billing by
    type of application (gaming, steaming, browsing, voice), billing by destination,
    and even billing of specific content. Furthermore, a single data prepaid service
    may need to accomodate simultaneous network access by multiple devices (phone,
    laptop, PDA). This paper discusses design issues for a protocol between a prepaid
    application and the data network element. It defines an architecture and terminology.
    It describes basic characteristics of data prepaid service, as well as some advanced
    features. It analyzes the main technical issues, especially performance issues.
    Finally, this paper describes the semantics of an illustrative prepaid data service
    protocol. This document does not, however, specify such a protocol.</p>"
