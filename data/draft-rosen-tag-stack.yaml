abstract:
- content: "<p>'Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)' [1,2,9] requires a set of procedures
    for augmenting network layer packets with 'label stacks' (sometimes called 'tag
    stacks'), thereby turning them into 'labeled packets'. Routers which support MPLS
    are known as 'Label Switching Routers', or 'LSRs'. In order to transmit a labeled
    packet on a particular data link, an LSR must support an encoding technique which,
    given a label stack and a network layer packet, produces a labeled packet. This
    document specifies the encoding to be used by an LSR in order to transmit labeled
    packets on PPP data links and on LAN data links. This document also specifies
    rules and procedures for processing the various fields of the label stack encoding.</p>"
