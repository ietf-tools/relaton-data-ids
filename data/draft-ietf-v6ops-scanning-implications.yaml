abstract:
- content: "<p>The much larger default 64-bit subnet address space of IPv6 should
    in principle make traditional network (port) scanning techniques used by certain
    network worms or scanning tools less effective. While traditional network scanning
    probes (whether by individuals or automated via network worms) may become less
    common, administrators should be aware that attackers may use other techniques
    to discover IPv6 addresses on a target network, and thus they should also be aware
    of measures that are available to mitigate them. This informational document discusses
    approaches that administrators could take when planning their site address allocation
    and management strategies as part of a defence-in-depth approach to network security.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
