abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    [RFC3748] method for identity distribution, authentication and session key distribution
    using the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM
    has been defined by the TCG in order to establish a root of trust and measurements
    in (consumer) computers. It provides several cryptographic functions and a secure
    storage for keys and hashes. There is also a TPM specification for mobile devices
    called Mobile Trusted Module (MTM), which can also be used for EAP-TPM. This new
    EAP method allows network authentication, which also supports user anonymity,
    the usage of different user identities for the authentication with different network
    operators, result indication, and a fast re-authentication.</p>"
