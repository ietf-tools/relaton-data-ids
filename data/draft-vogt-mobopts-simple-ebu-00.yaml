abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure use of
    route optimization between unacquainted nodes. Unfortunately, this procedure is
    known to have undesired impacts on handoff latency. This document specifies extensions
    to Mobile IPv6 that eliminate the latency of the return-routability procedure.
    The extensions thus provide a basis for more efficient reactive as well as proactive
    handoff management. They are optional and fully backward-compatible.</p>"
