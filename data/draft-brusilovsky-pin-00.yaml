abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this Internet Draft is to start discussion on the issues
    involved in PSTN Internet Notification (PIN), as part of interconnecting IP and
    Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with the intent of converging existing
    and creating new hybrid PSTN and IP services. PSTN Events Notification, based
    on open well-defined protocols, will promote interoperability of both the networks
    and systems built by different vendors. This Internet Draft is submitted with
    the goal of becoming an informational RFC. The rest of this document is as follows:
    Section 2 briefly describes the PIN services. Section 3 describes the scope of
    the proposed project by introducing its overall architecture and identifying the
    interfaces to be standardized. Sections 4, 5, and 6 respectively address security
    considerations, supply references, and provide the authors address, as required
    by [1]. Section 7 acknowledges individuals providing assistance in the creation
    of this document.</p>"
