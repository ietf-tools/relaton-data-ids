- content: "<p>As part of the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture [3], conference
    course control deals with the control of running conferences after the creation
    of the initial conference state with respect to the membership and access control
    during runtime of the session. The spectrum of scenarios reaches from small multiparty
    gatherings up to large scaled meetings with a high fluctuation of userâ€™s membership
    and activity. This document identifies the problem areas to define the scope of
    conference course control efforts within the IETF.</p>"
