abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a method (called Partial Resolution Method) for
    resolving IP addresses to ATM addresses. It does not specify a particular Address
    Resolution Protocol. In fact, any server-based address resolution protocol can
    be used in conjunction with the method described in this document. The Partial
    Resolution Method attempts to reduce the number of round trips needed for ATM
    address resolution and subsequent connection establishment by taking advantage
    of the ATM signalling protocol.</p>"
