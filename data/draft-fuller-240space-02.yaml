abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo reclassifies the address block 240.0.0.0/4 as usable address
    space. While the community has not concluded whether the block should be considered
    public or private, given the current consumption rate, it is clear that the block
    should not be left unused. This document also makes several recommendations on
    ways that current implementations of the IP protocol stack will need to be modified
    to make this address space usable.</p>"
