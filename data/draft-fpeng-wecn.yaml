abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP congestion control has been developed on the assumption that congestion
    in the network to be the only cause for packet loss. Thus, it drops its transmit
    window upon detecting a packet loss. In the presence of high erro rates and intermittent
    connective characteristic of wireless link, these results in an unnecessary reduction
    in link bandwidth utilization for packet losses are not mainly due to congestion.</p>"
