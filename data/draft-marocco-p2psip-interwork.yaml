abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how user agents registered in P2PSIP overlay
    networks can interwork with those in conventional SIP networks. Communications
    between any two user agents will happen through the SIP protocol and the location
    of SIP servers will follow the usual procedures. However, interworking in some
    environments may require the support of additional elements; this document also
    describes such elements and how to locate them in P2PSIP overlays.</p>"
