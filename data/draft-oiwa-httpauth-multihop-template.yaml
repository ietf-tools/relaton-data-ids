abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a common protocol design template for authentication
    on the Hyper-text Transport Protocol (HTTP) involving multi-hop message exchanges.
    To facilitate advanced authentication technologies such as hash-based exchanges,
    zero-knowledge password proof, or public-key authentications on HTTP, a kind of
    state management and key management facilities are required on the general HTTP
    authentication message framework. Also, to optimize performance of such authentication
    schemes, a well-designed mechanism for key caching and re-authentication are needed.
    The template defined in this document provides a generic foundation for implementing
    such advanced authentication technologies.</p>"
