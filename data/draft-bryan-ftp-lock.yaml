abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the biggest hurdles for FTP in real life usage is its use of
    two connections. First, it uses a primary connection to send control commands
    on, and when it sends or receives data, it opens a second TCP stream for that
    purpose. This document specifies a new FTP LOCK command to be used by clients
    to request the server to use the control connection for data transfers, using
    a single port instead of two.</p>"
