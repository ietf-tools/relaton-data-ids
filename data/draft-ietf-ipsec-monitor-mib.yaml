abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for IPsec
    security associations (SAs). It does not define MIBs that may be used for configuring
    IPsec implementations or for providing low-level diagnostic or debugging information.
    It assumes no specific use of IPsec. Further, it does not provide policy information.
    The purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators to determine operating
    conditions and perform system operational level monitoring of the IPsec portion
    of their network. Statistics are provided as well. Additionally, it may be used
    as the basis for application specific MIBs for specific uses of IPsec SAs.</p>"
