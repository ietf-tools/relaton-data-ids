abstract:
- content: "<p>For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet universal,
    and because an international standard for the internet community should be documented
    and stable, this I-D has been released with the intention of producing an RFC
    to document the character use and naming conventions of the SignWriting community
    on the Internet. The SignWriting Script is an international standard for writing
    sign languages by hand or with computers. From education to research, from entertainment
    to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because people are using it to write
    signed languages. The SignWriting Script has two major families: Block Printing
    for the reader and Handwriting for the writer. The script encoding model presented
    in this document evolved from the Block Printing half of the SignWriting Script.
    The SignWriting Text encoding model encompasses the Block Printing family of the
    SignWriting Script. The plain text model for the mathematical names has been stable
    since January 12th, 2012. The visual image can be SVG generated on the server
    or created with an experimental TrueType Font. The coded character sets and character
    encoding forms are documented with regular expressions. The ad hoc graphemes of
    informal SignWriting were first created in 1974. Ad hoc graphemes are still used
    in the handwriting family. The standardized symbols of computerized Block Printing
    text began in 1986. After several generations of writers and standardized symbolsets,
    the ISWA 2010 has been optimized and refined as a 16-bit coded character set with
    several isomorphic encodings based on an ordered hierarchy with 6 degrees of significance.
    The International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 is a mathematical symbolset that has
    been stable since its initial release on May 11th, 2010. The SignPuddle Standard
    for SignWriting Text is an open and freely available encoding model for sign language
    as text. The licenses include the Open Font License for the fonts, Creative Commons
    by-sa (Attribution, Share Alike) for the documentation, and the GPL for the software
    implementation. The technological infrastructure continues to expand and should
    be fully realized by the time this I-D has become an RFC. SignPuddle Online contains
    almost 1 million examples of 2-dimensional signs written by the internet community.
    Each logogram has a mathematical name which describes the freeform placement of
    the symbols. These strings are the written record of the sign. This standard and
    emerging infrastructure are used for the sign language Wikipedia project on Wikimedia
    Labs. This standard is being integrated with the SignTyp linguistic coding system
    developed by Rachel Channon through an NSF grant. This standard was the origin
    for the alternate Unicode proposals. For Unicode, the current use of the Private
    Use Area font characters is documented. The state of the TrueType Font is explained.
    A character proposal for plane 1 is included that is isomorphic with the characters
    that are currently used by the community. Three appendices discuss additional
    topics to the standard. The first discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and
    example document, stable since January 12, 2012. The second discusses the founding
    principles of Cartesian SignWriting: a script encoding model for SignWriting Block
    Printing. The third discusses a common framework for written sign language grammar.
    This memo concretely defines a conceptual character encoding map for the Internet
    community. It is published for reference, examination, implementation, and evaluation.
    Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>"
