abstract:
- content: "<p>It is expected that MPLS-based recovery could become a viable option
    for obtaining faster restoration than layer 3 rerouting. To deliver reliable service,
    however, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS)[ ], [ ] requires a set of procedures
    to provide protection of the traffic carried on the label switched paths (LSPs).
    This imposes certain requirements on the path recovery process [ ], and requires
    procedures for the configuration of working and protection paths, for the communication
    of fault information to appropriate switching elements, and for the activation
    of appropriate switchover actions. This document specifies a mechanism for path
    protection switching and restoration in MPLS networks.</p>"
