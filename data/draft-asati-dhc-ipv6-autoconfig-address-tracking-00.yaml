abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators commonly use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) to assign IP addresses to the hosts, and track them. However, the tracking
    capability is lost when stateless autoconfiguration or manual methods are used
    to assign IPv6 addresses. This document proposes a Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) based mechanism that the last hop router can use to
    convey the hosts' IPv6 addresses for the tracking and logging purposes, without
    requiring any changes to the hosts.</p>"
