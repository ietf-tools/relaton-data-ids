abstract:
- content: "<p>A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-based extension
    for DKIM ADSP records that allows domains in the From header field to authorize
    acceptable third-party signatures. This approach allows autonomous and unilateral
    authorizations for third- party domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions.
    The extended scope of DKIM signing practice assertions introduced here supplants
    transparent authorization schemes that are more difficult to administer. Alternatives
    for facilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate coordination
    between two or more domains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records,
    DNS zone delegations, and/or a regular exchange of public/private keys. Checking
    TPA-Label Resource Records for signing practices might occur infrequently when
    a message is not compliant with restrictive ADSP practices, where an Author Domain
    Signature is either missing or invalid. When a third-party signature is found,
    TPA-Label Resource Record transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains
    to authorize specific third-party signing domains. Recipients are afforded a method
    to determine whether authorization exists in situations where other modes of authorization
    are impractical. TPA- Label Resource Records permit Author Domains a means to
    influence message handling selectively, for messages otherwise lacking valid Author
    Domain signatures.</p>"
