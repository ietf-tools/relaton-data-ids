abstract:
- content: "<p>As is mentioned in draft [CCO PS &amp; USECASE], the most obvious problem
    on why existing protocols cannot meet the high-performance requirements of collective
    communications is that these distributed applications are not co-designed with
    the underlying networking protocols. There is a semantic gap between inter-process
    message transportation and packet forwarding, which should be bridged by efficient
    mapping and optimization. This draft further presents the technical requirements
    on how the collective communication optimization should be designed, and makes
    some discussion and analysis on several related work.</p>"
