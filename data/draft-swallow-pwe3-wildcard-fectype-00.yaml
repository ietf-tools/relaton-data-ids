abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized PWid FEC permits a procedure know as single-sided signaling
    as documented. In this procedure, one end of the pseudowire always initiates the
    pseudowire setup and the target of that label mapping message only signals in
    response. For certain applications of pseudowires it is advantages to configure
    the pseudowire type (PW type) at the target of the initial label mapping message.
    This document specifies a means of doing this.</p>"
