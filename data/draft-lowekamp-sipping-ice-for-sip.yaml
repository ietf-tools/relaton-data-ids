abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft explores a way SIP can be extended to allow a new dialog
    directly between the endpoints to replace an initial dialog that had one or more
    proxies in the signalling path. This technique relies on ICE to perform hole punching
    that allows a direct connection to be used in deployments where a sip-outbound
    proxy or SBC is used to establish SIP connections across NAT or firewall boundaries.
    It can also be used to replace such a dialog with a secure connection directly
    between the endpoints. This technique can be applied to traditional proxy-based
    SIP routing as well as to emerging P2PSIP deployments that lack centrally located
    proxies. This draft describes early work that evolved from ideas initially developed
    for P2PSIP that are no longer being pursued. We are interested in feedback on
    whether there is broader interest in these techniques.</p>"
