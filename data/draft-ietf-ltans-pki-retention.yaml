abstract:
- content: "<p>In most PKIs, directory servers are used to provide current certificates
    and revocation information to relying parties. In situations where certificates
    must be validated relative to a time in the past, relying parties often have no
    means of obtaining the necessary PKI artifacts. This specification defines several
    directory attributes to support validation using historical PKI artifacts.</p>"
