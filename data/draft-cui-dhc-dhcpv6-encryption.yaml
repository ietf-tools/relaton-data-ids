abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables DHCPv6
    servers to configure network parameters dynamically. However, due to the unsecured
    nature, various critical identifiers used in DHCPv6 are vulnerable to several
    types of attack. In order to protect the DHCPv6 from passive attack, such as pervasive
    monitoring attack, this document provides a mechanism to achieve the encryption
    between the DHCPv6 client and server.</p>"
