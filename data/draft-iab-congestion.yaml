abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses IAB concerns about effective end-to-end congestion
    control for best-effort voice traffic in the Internet. These concerns have to
    do with fairness, user quality, and with the dangers of congestion collapse. The
    concerns are particularly relevant in light of the absence of a widespread Quality
    of Service (QoS) deployment in the Internet, and the likelihood that this situation
    will not change much in the near term. This document is not making any recommendations
    about deployment paths for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in terms of QoS
    support, and is not claiming that best-effort service can be relied upon to give
    acceptable performance for VoIP. We are merely observing that voice traffic is
    occasionally deployed as best-effort traffic over some links in the Internet,
    that we expect this occasional deployment to continue, and that we have concerns
    about the lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for this best-effort
    voice traffic. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
