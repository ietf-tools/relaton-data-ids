abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we propose a new multicast protocol called SEM (Simple
    Explicit Multicast) or simple Xcast. This protocol uses an efficient method to
    construct the multicast tree and deliver multicast packets. In order to construct
    the multicast tree, this protocol uses the same mechanism as Xcast+. For the delivery
    of multicast packets it uses the mechanism of branching routers similar to the
    mechanism used in REUNITE I and REUNITE II.</p>"
