abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4) header includes a 16-bit Identification
    field in all packets, but this length is too small to ensure reassembly integrity
    even at moderate data rates in modern networks. Even for Internet Protocol, version
    6 (IPv6), the 32-bit Identification field included when a Fragment Header is present
    may be smaller than desired for some applications. This specification addresses
    these limitations by defining an IPv6 Extended Fragment Header that includes a
    64-bit Identification; it further defines a control messaging service for fragment
    retransmission and reassembly congestion management.</p>"
