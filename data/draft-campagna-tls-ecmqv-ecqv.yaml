abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols that use Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone
    (ECQV) certificates to authenticate an Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV)
    exchange. These cipher suites provide forward secrecy. Status of this Memo This
