abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile phone devices are usually configured with multiple wireless
    access network cards, such as LTE/5G, Wi-Fi. And the wireless network is a network
    with highly time-varying bandwidth. For a single wireless device, the limited
    bandwidth cannot meet the peak rate requirements of low-latency applications.
    MPTCP supports the simultaneous use of multiple networks on mobile devices. Due
    to the time-varying nature of wireless networks, it is challenging for MPTCP to
    accurately schedule data blocks to different sub-streams to meet their low-latency
    requirements. This document proposes a new cross- layer feedback method for wireless
    networks to pass the scheduling information and status of the wireless network
    to the MPTCP Server. MPTCP Server can predict the transmission capacity of the
    wireless network based on this cross-layer information, thereby improving the
    efficiency of data block scheduling on multipaths.</p>"
