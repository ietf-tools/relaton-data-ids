abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of centralized mobility management approaches -- such as Mobile
    IPv6 -- poses some difficulties to operators of current and future networks, due
    to the expected large number of mobile users and their exigent demands. All this
    has triggered the need for distributed mobility management alternatives, that
    alleviate operators' concerns allowing for cheaper and more efficient network
    deployments. This draft describes a possible way of achieving a distributed mobility
    behavior with Client Mobile IP, based on Mobile IPv6 and the use of Cryptographic
    Generated Addresses.</p>"
