abstract:
- content: <p>This RFC describes best current practices for implementing Service Provider
    network infrastructure protection for network elements. This RFC complements and
    extends RFC 2267 and RFC 3704. RFC 2267 provides guidelines for filtering traffic
    on the ingress to service provider networks. RFC 3704 expands the recommendations
    described in RFC 2267 to address operational filtering guidelines for single and
    multi-homed environments. The focus of those RFCs is on filtering packets on ingress
    to a network, regardless of destination, if those packets have a spoofed source
    address, or if the source address fall within "reserved" address space. Deployment
    of RFCs 2267 and 3704 has limited the effects of denial of service attacks by
    dropping ingress packets with spoofed source addresses, which in turn offers other
    benefits by ensuring that packets coming into a network originate from validly
    allocated and consistent sources. This document focuses solely on traffic destined
    to elements of the the network infrastructure itself. This document presents techniques
    that, together with network edge ingress filtering and RFC 2267 and RFC 3704,
    provides a defense in depth approach for infrastructure protection. This document
    does not present recommendations for protocol validation (i.e. "sanity checking")
    nor does it address guidelines for general security configuration.</p>
