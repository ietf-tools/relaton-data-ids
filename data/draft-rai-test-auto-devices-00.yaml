abstract:
- content: "<p>Test Automation is a process that is being adopted by vendors aggresively
    to broaden the scope for testing. Automation of testing of L2/L3 devices can also
    enable faster and 'always on' mode of test environment in the Test labs, thus
    maximizing usage of lab infrastructure, round the clock, without human intervention.
    More often than not, lack of standards, can cause an automation architecture to
    go awry and the cost of the same could be catastrophic. Hence this informational
    draft endeavours to bring forth a standard framework for automation, which can
    be referred to, by test teams of various network equipment vendors and users.</p>"
