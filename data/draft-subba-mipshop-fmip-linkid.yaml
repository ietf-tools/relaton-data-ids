abstract:
- content: "<p>FMIPv6 aims to achieve seamless handoff but needs (AP-ID, AR-Info)
    in PARs to function and can't work if PAR doesn't have an entry for the next AP.
    In this draft, we present a scheme to dynamically build (AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple
    in PAR and make FMIPv6 perform even when PAR doesn't have a suitable (AP-ID, AR-Info)
    tuple by putting LinkID prefix in L2 beacon.</p>"
