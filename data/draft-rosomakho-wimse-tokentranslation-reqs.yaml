abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the requirements for workload token translation
    within the context of the Workload Identity in Multi System Environments (WIMSE).
    Token translation may be required for interoperability between workloads or for
    complying with security requirements of multi-system environments. This requirement
    document considers various aspects of token translation, such as changes in token
    format, content encoding, cryptographic properties, and context embedding. Additionally,
    this document raises security considerations to be addressed by specific token
    translation implementations, including replay attacks, access control, and privacy
    concerns.</p>"
