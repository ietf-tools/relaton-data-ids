abstract:
- content: <p>A relying party verifying a JSON Web Token (JWT) needs to verify that
    the public key used to verify the signature legitimately represents the issuer
    represented in the "iss" claim of the JWT. Today, relying parties commonly use
    the "iss" claim to fetch a set of authorized signing keys over HTTPS, relying
    on the security of HTTPS to establish the authority of the downloaded keys for
    that issuer. The ephemerality of this proof of authority makes it unsuitable for
    use cases where a JWT might need to be verified for some time. In this document,
    we define a format for Proofs of Issuer Key Authority, which establish the authority
    of a key using a signed object instead of an HTTPS connection.</p>
