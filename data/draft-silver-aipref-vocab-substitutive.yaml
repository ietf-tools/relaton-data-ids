abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet Draft proposes a category entitled "AI Substitutive Use"
    which would enable parties to express a preference regarding how digital assets
    are used by automated processing systems, with a focus on post-training (inference-time)
    uses that are likely to result in the creation of AI-generated outputs that substitute
    for the original asset. The proposal is for this category to nest within the larger
    category of Automated Processing, currently envisaged in the working group draft
    [AIPREF-VOCAB] (21 July 2025).</p>
