abstract:
- content: "<p>Most existing literature on load balancing in data center networks(DCN)
    focuses on balancing traffic between servers (links), but there is relatively
    little attention given to balancing traffic at the core-level of individual servers.
    In this draft, we present a load balancing framework for DCN that is aware of
    core-level load, in order to address this issue. Specifically, our approach transfers
    real-time load from CPUs to an L4 load balancer, which then selects a core with
    lower load based on load information to deliver the data packet. Theoretically,
    our approach can completely avoid this problem, making the system more stable
    and enabling higher CPU utilization without overprovisioning.</p>"
