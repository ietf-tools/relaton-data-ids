abstract:
- content: "<p>A large amount of email is non-personal, automated communication, such
    as newsletters, confirmations and legitimate advertisements. These are often tagged
    as spam by content filters. This type of correspondence is usually initiated by
    a transaction over the web, such as a purchase or signing up for a service. Therefore,
    we propose a new HTTP header to carry the addresses that may be used by the provider
    to correspond with the user. These may be email addresses, or those used in other
    protocols, such as SIP. This will facilitate the automatic inclusion of these
    addresses in whitelists used for spam prevention.</p>"
