abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes an address allocation framework for Geographically
    Aggregatable Provider Independent (GAPI) IPv6 addresses for the purpose of multihoming.
    A /16 is divided in a hierarchical manner over geographical entities such as parts
    of continents, countries, states, provinces and metropolitan areas, with each
    receiving one or more /32 allocations from which end-user assignments can be made.
    The number of /32 allocations for a geographical entity depends on the current
    population. This address allocation framework in itself does not present a scalable
    multihoming solution, it merely provides a necessary building block for such solutions.</p>"
