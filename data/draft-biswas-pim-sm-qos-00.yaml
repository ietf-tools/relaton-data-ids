abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for QoS-aware multicast routing
    based on enhancements to PIM-SM. This framework has two components: the development
    of multicast tree computation schemes that account for heterogeneous receiver
    QoS requirements, and the incorporation of QoS capabilities into PIM-SM for establishing
    computed paths. The choice of PIM-SM is based on its ability to support receiver-initiated
    join, both shared and source-specific trees. Two decentralized tree computation
    schemes, TIQM and NUQM, are considered in this document, both requiring support
    from the underlying unicast routing scheme to acquire link and nodal resource
    availability information. Additionally, TIQM requires complete information at
    each router about the resource allocation in the network for the existing multicast
    tree. After a brief analysis of these two schemes, the incorporation of QoS awareness
    in PIM-SM with NUQM as its underlying route computation mechanism is presented.
    It is shown that with few extensions to its existing control syntaxes, PIM-SM
    can be successfully used for QoS integration. Finally, a Tree State Update (TSU)
    mechanism, which can be used for efficient and scalable dissemination of multicast
    tree state information, is proposed. It is shown that by using the proposed TSU
    protocol it is possible to partially alleviate the control overhead of TIQM.</p>"
