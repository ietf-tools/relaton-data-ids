abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two Notification Payloads for the Internet Key
    Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2): NUM_QUEUES and QUEUE_INFO. These payloads
    add support for indicating that the negotiating of multiple identical Child SAs
    are to be used to optimize performance based on the number of queues or CPUs,
    or to create multiple Child SAs for different Quality of Service (QoS) levels.
    It indicates that a newer idetnical Child SA should not be interpreted as a replacement
    Child SA. Using multiple identical Child Sa's has the benefit that each stream
    has its own Sequence Number, ensuring that CPU's don't have to synchronize their
    crypto state or disable their packet replay detection.</p>"
