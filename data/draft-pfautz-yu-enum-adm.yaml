abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers administrative processes for ENUM and offers
    a general administrative model for an environment where number portability has
    been implemented. The ENUM administrative process is a critical piece in making
    ENUM operational. The administrative process involves several entities. A telephony
    user's identity and his/her assignment of a telephone number must be validated
    before ENUM service can be granted. Therefore, the entity that assigns telephone
    numbers (often but not always telephony user's telephony service provider) plays
    an important and sometimes necessary role in making the ENUM administrative process
    successful.</p>"
