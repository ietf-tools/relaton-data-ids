abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a transition mechanism that combines both [SIIT]
    and DSTM mechanisms by adding some extensions to allow fast routing of inbound
    packets. This will result in a more decentralised and flexible tool to allow V6
    only hosts to communicate with V4 only hosts. The proposed extensions will provide
    a way that allows SIIT routers to route packets addressed to a host running a
    single IPv6 stack with minimum delay which is suited to real time services.</p>"
