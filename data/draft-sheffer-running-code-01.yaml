abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts
    to record the status of known implementations. This will allow reviewers and working
    groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running
    code and potentially reward the documented protocols by treating the documents
    with implementations preferentially. The process in this document is offered as
    an experiment. Authors of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the
    process for their documents, and working groups are invited to think about applying
    the process to all of their protocol specifications. The authors of this document
    intend to collate experiences with this experiment and to report them to the community.</p>"
