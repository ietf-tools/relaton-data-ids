abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Network Slice service aims to meet the connectivity demands
    of a network slice customer with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and
    Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay network. A Network Resource
    Partition (NRP) is a set of network resources that are allocated from the underlay
    network to carry a specific set of network traffic and meet the required SLOs
    and SLEs. One or multiple IETF Network Slice services can be mapped to one NRP.
    As the demand for IETF Network Slice services increases, scalability would become
    an important factor for the large scale deployment of IETF Network Slices. Although
    the scalability of IETF Network Slices can be improved by mapping a group of IETF
    Network Slices to one NRP, there are concerns about the scalability of NRPs. This
    document describes the scalability considerations about NRPs in the network control
    plane and data plane, and some optimization mechanisms are proposed.</p>"
