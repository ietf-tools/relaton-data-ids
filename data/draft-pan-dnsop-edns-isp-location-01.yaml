abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) option
    that is in active use to carry &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; isp location information
    about the network that originated a DNS query and the network for which the subsequent
    response can be cached. It is inspired by EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) with some privacy
    considerations, goals to reduce the "guess location of client's IP" work on Authoritative
    Nameservers.</p>
