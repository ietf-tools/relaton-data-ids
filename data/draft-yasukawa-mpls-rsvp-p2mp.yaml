abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic
    Engineering (TE) which extends 'RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels',
    RFC 3209, and 'Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource
    ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions', RFC 3473, to support
    P2MP TE LSPs. A P2MP TE LSP is established by setting up multiple standard point-
    to-point (P2P) TE LSPs from a sender node and all the downstream branch nodes
    along the P2P TE LSP to one of the leaf nodes of the P2MP TE LSP. A branched LSP
    is associated with original trunk LSP by newly defined Association object so that
    the P2MP LSP tunnel is established over the P2MP path. Because only a single standard
    LSP will be present on any given link along the P2MP LSP, the defined approach
    realizes maximum compatibility with existing implementations. The solution supports
    standard tree operations: setup, graft/join, and prune/leave. As the (G)MPLS signaling
    is used, the P2MP TE LSP can be built using any switching technology supported
    by GMPLS. This includes non-packet technologies.</p>"
