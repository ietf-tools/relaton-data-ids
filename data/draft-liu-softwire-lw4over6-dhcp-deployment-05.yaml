abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an IPv4 over IPv6
    hub and spoke mechanism that provides overlay IPv4 services in an IPv6-only access
    network. Provisioning IPv4 addresses and port set to customers is the core function
    of Lightweight 4over6 control plane. [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] illustrates
    how to use DHCPv6 for deterministic IPv4 provisioning. This document discusses
    how to provision IPv4 parameters by using dynamic IPv4 provisioning protocols
    such as DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341]. This document describes a dynamic IPv4 provisioning
    mode for Lightweight 4over6 that uses DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] for IPv4 address
    provisioning.</p>"
