abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives additional algorithms and associated ASN.1 identifiers
    for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) used with the Internet X.509 Public Key
    Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile (PKIX).
    The algorithms and identifiers here are consistent with both ANSI X9.62-2005 and
    X9.63-2001, and shall be consistent with the forthcoming revisions of these documents.
    Consistency shall also be maintained with SEC1 and SEC2, and any revisions or
