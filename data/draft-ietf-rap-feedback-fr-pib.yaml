abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a portion of the Policy Information Base (PIB)
    to control policy usage collection and reporting in a device. The provisioning
    classes specified here allow a Policy Decision Point (PDP) to select which policy
    objects should collect usage information, what information should be collected
    and when it should be reported. This PIB requires the presence of other PIBs (defined
    elsewhere) that provide the policy objects from which usage information is collected.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
