abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Merkle-tree-based approach that can act as
    an audit-layer detection mechanism to identify a malicious hub, responsible for
    interoperable group communication between various messaging platforms. The proposed
    approach is based on the MIMI protocol, which uses a central hub for timestamping
    and broadcasting messages to clients operating on different platforms. Even though
    all MLS ciphertexts are end-to-end encrypted, they are routed through the hub,
    making it a lucrative attack surface for message reordering attacks. To detect
    such attacks, the proposed approach suggests creating Merkle proofs of messages
    and timestamps on the client-side, which can subsequently be broadcast to other
    clients for verification with local Merkle proofs. The broadcast messages are
    encrypted too and are sent probabilistically to avoid being dropped by the hub.
    If any of the proofs do not match, an alert is broadcast to the room, indicating
    a malicious hub. The approach has minimal communication overhead for practical
    purposes.</p>"
