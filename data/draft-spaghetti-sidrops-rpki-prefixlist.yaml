abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a "RPKI Prefix List", a Cryptographic Message
    Syntax (CMS) protected content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) to carry the complete list of prefixes which an Autonomous System (AS)
    may originate to all or any of its routing peers. The validation of a RPKI Prefix
    List confirms that the holder of the listed ASN produced the object, and that
    this list is a current, accurate and complete description of address prefixes
    that may be announced into the routing system originated by this AS.</p>
