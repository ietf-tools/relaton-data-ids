abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the identifier ownership problem. It does so
    by using characteristics of Statistic Uniqueness and Cryptographic Verifiability
    (SUCV) of certain entities which this document calls SUCV Identifiers (SUCV ID's).
    This note also proposes using these SUCV characteristics in related entities called
    SUCV Addresses in order to severely limit certain classes of denial of service
    attacks and hijacking attacks. SUCV addresses are particularly applicable to solve
    the 'address ownership' problem that severely undermines confidence in mechanisms
    like Binding Updates in Mobile IP for IPv6.</p>"
