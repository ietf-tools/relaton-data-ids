abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies how to use IPv6 a+p technique in mobile networks
    for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). Mobile node which is a dual-stack node can receive
    a shared IPv4 Home Address together with a port range from the Local Mobility
    Agent (LMA). LMA is co-located with Port Range Router (PRR). Mobile Access Gateway
    (MAG) encapsulates IPv4 datagrams in IPv6 which are decapsulated at the LMA. In
    the binding mode, LMA as PRR receives incoming IPv4 datagrams, determines the
    routing identifier, finds the binding cache entry for this MN and then encapsulates
    the IPv4 datagram in an IPv6 one and forwards the encapsulated datagram to MN.
    The stateless mode is also described. Mobile network could be WiMAX network or
    3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) network.</p>"
