abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chain architecture leads to more adaptive network
    nodes. It allows splitting the network function into fine-grained build blocks
    --- service function, and combining the network functions into service function
    chain to formulate complicated services. Further, the service function chain should
    be instantiated by selecting the optimal instance from the candidates for each
    service function in it. This document discusses the required components during
    the instantiation of service function chain in the network.</p>"
