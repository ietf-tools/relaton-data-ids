- content: "<p>The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are designed
    to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to the IETF and Internet
    communities while permitting the authors to retain as many rights as possible.
    This document updates [RFC5378] to change the name of the IETF Trust to the IETF
    IPMC and the editor's contact info, but does not change the policies or intellectual
    property rights in Contributions to the IETF from those in [RFC5378].</p>"
