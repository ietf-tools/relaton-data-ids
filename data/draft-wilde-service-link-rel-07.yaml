abstract:
- content: <p>Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that
    are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service provider.
    Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs".
    This specification defines link relations for representing relationships from
    those resources to ones that provide documentation, descriptions, or metadata
    for these Web services. Documentation is primarily intended for human consumers,
    whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers; metadata
    is supposed to be information about a service's context. It also defines a link
    relation to identify status resources that are used to represent operational information
    about service status.</p>
