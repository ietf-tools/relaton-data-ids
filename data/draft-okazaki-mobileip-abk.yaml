abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a method for authenticating and authorizing
    Mobile IPv6 [MIPv6] Binding Updates between a Correspondent Node and a Mobile
    Node where there exists no pre-established direct or indirect security relationship
    between those two entities. The method uses a new security technique called Address
    Based Keys. Address Based Keys are an alternative to other cryptographic address
    mechanisms for optimizing Binding Update security to avoid the need for Return
    Routability checks on each binding update. Address Based Keys use some mathematical
    results in identity based cryptosystems that have been known to cryptographers
    for some time, but have not been widely discussed in the network security community.</p>"
