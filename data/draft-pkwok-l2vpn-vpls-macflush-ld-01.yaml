abstract:
- content: "<p>MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to remove
    or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned, for faster convergence.
    Failure of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity (e.g Split Horizon)
    among VPLS PE nodes may cause MAC Address Withdrawal messages looping among those
    nodes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of control plane
    in the PE nodes. This document describes a mechanism to detect and prevent loops
    of MAC Address Withdrawal messages in a VPLS PE node on such failures.</p>"
