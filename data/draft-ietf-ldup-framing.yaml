abstract:
- content: "<p>Certain types of LDAP applications can benefit from the ability to
    specify the beginning and end of a related group of operations. For example, the
    LDUP multimaster update protocol [ARCHITECTURE] requires that two servers agree
    to begin a session to transfer pending replication updates. This document provides
    a framework for constructing protocols that feature a framed set of related operations.
    It defines a pair of LDAPv3 extended operations that provide begin-end framing,
    and a pair of extended operations used to respond the begin-end framing operations.
    The nature of the actual LDAP operations carried inside these framing operations
    is not specified in this document. All protocol elements described here are LDAP
    Version 3 extended operations. LDAP Version 3 is described in RFC 2251 [LDAPv3].
    Certain terms used in this document are defined in the document 'LDAP Replication
    Architecture' [ARCHITECTURE].</p>"
