abstract:
- content: "<p>The EUI-64 identifier of a 6LoWPAN device can be used as the interface
    identifier of the IPv6 address, which can be used for for on-demand multi-hop
    routing in 6LoWPAN. One of the distinctive feature of 6LoWPAN is the capability
    of the dynamic assignment of 16- bit short addresses. By utilizing this dynamically
    assigned short address, a hierarchical routing which is very scalable can be employed.
    This This document defines a dynamic address assignment scheme and hierarchical
    routing HiLow) based on the assignment.</p>"
