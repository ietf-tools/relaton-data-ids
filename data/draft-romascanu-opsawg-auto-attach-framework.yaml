abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational document describes a method that allows for the
    automatic attachment of network objects (e.g. end stations, network devices, sensors,
    automation elements) to a core network based on the individual services that are
    run or configured on the objects, and the mapping of the services to the managed
    paths in the network. The framework proposed by this document describes the operations
    that need to happen in order to have the network objects connected to the network
    ('attached') in an automatic manner and start providing their functionality and
    services without any requirement or dependency between the protocol stack on the
    network objects and the method used to build the bridging or routing paths in
    the network core.</p>"
