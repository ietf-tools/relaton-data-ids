abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies call transfer interworking between the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks
    (also known as enterprise networks). SIP is an Internet application-layer control
    (signalling) protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one
    or more participants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone calls.
    QSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched
    calls, in particular telephone calls, within Private Integrated Services Networks
    (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number of ECMA Standards and published also as
    ISO/IEC standards.</p>"
