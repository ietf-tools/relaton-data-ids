abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an initial implementation of Media- independent
    Pre-Authentication (MPA) optimization. MPA is a mobile- assisted, secure handover
    optimization scheme that works over any link-layer and with any mobility management
    protocol. The implementation described in this document shows how existing protocols
    can be leveraged to realize the functionalities of MPA. It also includes empirical
    results gathered from experiments performed on a simulated network.</p>"
