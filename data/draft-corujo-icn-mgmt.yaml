abstract:
- content: "<p>ICN has been proposing and evaluating novel ways for reaching on-line
    content in upcoming Future Internet environments, leveraging intrinsic capabilities
    such as naming, caching and built-in security. In order to fully realize the capabilities
    and vision provided by ICN, supportive management procedures need to be ensured,
    providing the architectures, and the elements that figure in them, with the means
    to facilitate the delivery of content and the operation of the network. In the
    current Internet, these management aspects have been being developed and enhanced
    in parallel to the existing data protocol and mechanisms, resulting in a plethora
    of different and hard-to-integrate approaches, but still fulfil indispensable
    roles and actions for the operation and well-being of the network. We consider
    that the availability of management mechanisms for ICN will foster deployment
    and, as such, should be tackled still in the design and experimentation phases.
    In this way, this document addresses and identifies ICN management considerations,
    under two different settings: a) achieving management operations using ICN-based
    mechanisms and, b) how to manage ICN procedures themselves. The ultimate goal
    is to provide the necessary breadth to establish management mechanisms deployment
    guidelines in a common way throughout the existing ICN ecosystem of architectures.</p>"
