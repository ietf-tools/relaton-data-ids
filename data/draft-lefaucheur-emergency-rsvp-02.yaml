abstract:
- content: "<p>An Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) requires the ability
    to provide an elevated probability of session establishment to an authorized user
    in times of network congestion (typically, during a crisis). When supported over
    the Internet Protocol suite, this may be facilitated through a network layer admission
    control solution, which supports prioritized access to resources (e.g., bandwidth).
    These resources may be explicitly set aside for emergency services, or they may
    be shared with other sessions. This document specifies RSVP extensions that can
    be used to support such an admission priority capability at the network layer.
    Note that these extensions represent one possible solution component in satisfying
    ETS requirements. Other solution components, or other solutions, are outside the
    scope of this document.</p>"
