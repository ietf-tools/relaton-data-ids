abstract:
- content: "<p>Spine and leaf topologies are widely used in hyperscale and cloud scale
    networks. In most of these networks, configuration is automated, but difficult,
    and topology information is extracted through broad based connections. Policy
    is often integrated into the control plane, as well, making configuration, management,
    and troubleshooting difficult. Openfabric is an adaptation of an existing, widely
    deployed link state protocol, Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
    that is designed to: o Provide a full view of the topology from a single point
    in the network to simplify operations o Minimize configuration of each router
    (or switch) in the network o Optimize the operation of IS-IS within a spine and
    leaf fabric to enable scaling This document begins with an overview of openfabric,
    including a description of what may be removed from IS-IS to enable scaling. The
    document then describes an optimized adjacency formation process; an optimized
    flooding scheme; some thoughts on the operation of openfabric, metrics, and aggregation;
    and finally a description of the changes to the IS-IS protocol required for openfabric.</p>"
