abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP REFER method relies on the SIP-Specific Event Notification
    Framework. That framework was revised by RFC6665. This document highlights the
    implications of the requirement changes in RFC6665, and updates the definition
    of the REFER method, RFC3515, to clarify and disambiguate the impact of those
    changes.</p>"
