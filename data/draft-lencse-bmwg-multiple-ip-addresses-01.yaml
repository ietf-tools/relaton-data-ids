abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2544 has defined a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect
    devices. Its test frame format contained fixed IP addresses and fixed port numbers.
    RFC 4814 introduced pseudorandom port numbers, but it kept the usage of a single
    source and destination IP address pair when a single destination network is used.
    This limitation may cause an issue when the device under test uses Receive-Side
    Scaling (RSS) mechanism in the packet processing flow. RSS has two types of implementations:
    the first one only includes the IP addresses, whereas the second one also includes
    the port numbers into the tuple used for hashing. Benchmarking tests that use
    a single IP address pair and RFC 4814 pseudorandom port numbers are biased against
    the first type of RSS implementation, because in this case, the traffic is not
    distributed among the processing elements. This document recommends the usage
    of pseudorandom IP addresses in a similar manner as RFC 4814 did it with the port
    numbers. If accepted, this document updates all affected RFCs, including RFC 2544,
    RFC 4814, RFC 5180, RFC 8219.</p>"
