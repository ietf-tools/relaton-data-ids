abstract:
- content: "<p>4rd-U is proposed as an effort of unifying encapsulation and double
    translation solutions for the softwire of IPv4 over IPv6 domain. This attempt
    introduces new behaviors in the Internet transition architecture as well as semantics
    other than that of well-known Internet protocols. This documents provides a commentary
    on the semantic changes and their impacts.</p>"
