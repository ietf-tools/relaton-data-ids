abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a variant of the Privacy Pass issuance protocol
    that allows for tokens to be rate-limited on a per-origin basis. This enables
    origins to use tokens for use cases that need to restrict access from anonymous
    clients. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before publishing as an
    RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.com/tfpauly/privacy-proxy.</p>"
