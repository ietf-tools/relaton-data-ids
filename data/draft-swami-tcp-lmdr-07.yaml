abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP congestion control is based on the assumption that the end-to-end
    path of a connection changes only insignificantly after connection establishment.
    Network layer mobility protocols that change a connection's point of attachment
    transparently to the transport layer may violate this assumption and cause TCP
    to make congestion control decisions based on invalid information. This document
    describes a TCP option that allows a connection endpoint to inform a peer when
    it changes location. This document also outlines the proper congestion control
    behavior that should take place in the face of such network layer mobility.</p>"
