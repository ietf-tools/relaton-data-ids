abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service whereby an SMTP
    client and server may negotiate the use of a command streaming implementation
    model for SMTP. This model enables the batching of the all commands between the
    EHLO and DATA command. This extension significantly reduces the number of packets
    and round trips to send a message. Batching the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands
    for multiple receipients significantly decreases the protocol processing overhead
    when sending messsages to multiple receipients.</p>"
