abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the integration of authentication based on
    Challenge-Handshake Authenticaton Protocol into SOCKS Version 5. The primary algorithm
    to be used is HMAC-MD5, although the framework is general enough to permit use
    of MD5 or other keyed hash algorithms. This document describes the message formats
    and protocol details of incorporating CHAP into the SOCKS V5 authentication ''subnegotiation.''
    Support is included for authentication of server to client as well as client to
    server.</p>"
