abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposal for an architecture for the Dynamic-Anycast
    (Dyncast). It includes an architecture overview, main components that shall exist,
    and the workflow. An example of workflow is provided, focusing on the load-balance
    multi-edge based service use-case, where load is distributed in terms of both
    computing and networking resources through the dynamic anycast architecture.</p>"
