abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several proposals on increasing the TCP initial congestion
    window to a new hardcoded value and subsequent updates of this hardcoded value.
    This document explores the mechanism of dynamically determining the potentially
    unbounded Initial Window. This would allow for the future growth after only one
    software upgrade of the existing TCP stacks. Also this would allow automatic adjustment
    of the Initial Window size depending on the connectivity properties of the particular
    Internet host, while minimizing the retransmissions that result from overly optimistic
    initial congestion window selection.</p>"
