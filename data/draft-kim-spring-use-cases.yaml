abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, an SDN controller
    establishes flow paths. An SDN controller provides global optimization of paths
    by controlling all managed switches. However, long flow setup time and failure
    recovery problems arise due to control overhead of an SDN controller. Segment
    routing provides source routing function by designating an explicit path. SDN
    and segment routing can be combined to provide both global optimization and better
    performance. In this document, we illustrate SDN segment routing use cases of
    flow setup, failure recovery, Content Distribution Network(CDN), and dual homing.</p>"
