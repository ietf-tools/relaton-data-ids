abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to negotiate a multitude of parameters, settings, and
    algorithms when setting up sessions using Session Initiated Protocol (SIP). While
    SIP itself provides mechanisms for negotiation of these parameters on a per-session
    basis through the use of the INVITE method, it does not provide a ready mechanism
    for meta-session negotiation. The closest mechanism provided is the REGISTER method,
    however, this method is directed towards the registrar alone, and cannot be used
    to conduct negotiation of parameters between any two arbitrary SIP nodes.</p>"
