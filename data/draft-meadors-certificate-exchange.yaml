abstract:
- content: "<p>The EDIINT AS1, AS2 and AS3 message formats do not currently contain
    any neutral provisions for transporting and exchanging trading partner profiles
    or digital certificates. EDIINT Certificate Exchange Messaging provides the format
    and means to effectively exchange certificates for use within trading partner
    relationships. The messaging consists of two types of messages, Request and Response,
    which allow trading partners to communicate certificates, their intended usage
    and their acceptance through XML. Certificates can be specified for use in digital
    signatures, data encryption or SSL/TLS over HTTP (HTTPS).</p>"
