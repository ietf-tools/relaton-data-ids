abstract:
- content: "<p>This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines
    extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route diversity
    within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge nodes. A particular
    example where route diversity within the core network is desired, are dual-homed
    edge nodes. The core network is typically composed of multiple network domains
    and those multi-domain diversity aspects that have an implication on the GMPLS
    UNI extensions are discussed. The document also defines GMPLS UNI extensions to
    deal with latency requirements for edge node initiated LSPs. This document uses
    a VPN model that is based on the same premise as L1VPN framework [RFC4847] but
    may also be applied to other technologies. The extensions are applicable both
    to VPN and non VPN environments. These extensions move the UNI from basic connectivity
    to enhanced mode connectivity by including additional constraints while minimizing
    the exchange of CE to PE information. These extensions are applicable to the overlay
    extension service model. Route Diversity for customer LSPs are a common requirement
    applicable to L1VPNs. The UNI mechanisms described in this document are L1VPN
    compatible and can be applied to achieve diversity for sets of customer LSPs.
    The UNI extensions in support of latency constraints can also be applied to the
    extended overlay service model in order for the customer LSPs to meet certain
    latency requirements.</p>"
