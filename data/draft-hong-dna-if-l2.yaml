abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we consider and analyze various environments for applying
    Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) schemes. Although DNA schemes are typically
    run for each interface and a host separately checks for link changes on each interface
    when the host has multiple interfaces, DNA schemes in the host must be considered
    to check the multiple interfaces at the same time for a seamless service. In addition,
    DNA schemes in the host must be capable of managing together each DNA scheme on
    each interface. Current DNA schemes only rely on 'Break before Make' L2 technology
    such as 802.11. But now and in future, there will be other 'Make before break'
    L2 technologies such as CDMA. In these L2 technologies, DNA schemes must be operated
    differently in order to make use of their characteristics.</p>"
