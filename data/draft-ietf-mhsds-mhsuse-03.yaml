abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a procedure for managing distribution lists
    using the directory. This is an extension of the mechanism defined in X.400. This
    draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a protocol standard. Distribution
    of this memo is unlimited. Please send comments to the authors or to the discussion
    group &lt;mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com&gt;. Temporary Note: This note has been
    updated to reflect ongoing X.400 standardisation work in this area. There is some
    overlap, which needs to be considered and resolved.</p>"
