abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently published
    RFC. We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in 2018, looking for history
    and delays. The average RFC was produced in 3 years and 4 months, of which 2 years
    and 10 months were spent in the working group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus
    and IESG review, and 3 to 4 months in RFC production. The main variation in RFC
    production delays comes from the AUTH48 phase. We also measure the number of citations
    of the chosen RFC using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what
    we know about deployment. We show that citation counts indicate academic interest,
    but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications. The
    measurement of delays could be automated by processing dates and events recorded
    in the data tracker. The measurement of published RFC could be complemented by
    statistics on abandoned drafts, which would measure the efficiency of the IETF
    triaging process.</p>"
