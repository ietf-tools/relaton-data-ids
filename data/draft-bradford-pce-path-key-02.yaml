abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where
    the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous Systems (ASs), the path
    may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with each responsible for computing
    a segment of the path. However, in some cases (e.g. when ASs are administered
    by separate Service Providers), it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE
    to supply a path segment to a PCE in another domain, thus disclosing internal
    topology information. This issue may be circumvented by returning a loose hop
    and by invoking a new path computation from the domain boundary LSR during TE
    LSP setup as the LSP enters the second domain, but this technique has several
    issues including the problem of maintaining path diversity. This document defines
    a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of a path, called the Confidential
    Path Segment (CPS). The CPS may be replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed
    in the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource Reservation
    Protocol (RSVP) explicit route object.</p>"
