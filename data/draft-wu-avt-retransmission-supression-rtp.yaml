abstract:
- content: "<p>In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
    RFC 4585, a media source or middlebox may experience transient overload if some
    event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once. This feedback
    implosion can be mitigated if the device suffering from overload can send a third
    party loss report message to the receivers to inhibit further feedback. This memo
    defines RTCP extensions for third party loss report, to suppress NACK and FIR
    feedback requests. It also defines associated SDP signalling.</p>"
