abstract:
- content: "<p>A wide range of applications have proposed various extensions of the
    HTTP protocol. Current efforts span an enormous range, including distributed authoring,
    collaboration, printing, and remote procedure call mechanisms. These HTTP extensions
    are not coordinated, since there has been no standard framework for defining extensions
    and thus, separation of concerns. This document describes a generic extension
    mechanism for HTTP, which is designed to address the tension between private agreement
    and public specification and to accommodate extension of applications using HTTP
    clients, servers, and proxies. The proposal associates each extension with a globally
    unique identifier, and uses HTTP header fields to carry the extension identifier
    and related information between the parties involved in the extended communication.</p>"
