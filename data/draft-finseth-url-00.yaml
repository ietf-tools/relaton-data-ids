abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new URL scheme, 'eid'. This scheme provides
    a mechanism by which the local application can reference data that has been obtained
    by other, non-URL scheme means. The scheme is intended to provide a general escape
    mechanism to allow access to information for applications that are too specialized
    to justify their own schemes.</p>"
