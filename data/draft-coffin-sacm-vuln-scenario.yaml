abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a core narrative that walks through an automated
    enterprise vulnerability assessment scenario. It is aligned with the SACM use
    cases and begins with an enterprise ingesting vulnerability description data,
    followed by identifying endpoints on the network and collecting and storing information
    about them to enable posture assessment, and finally ends with assessing these
    endpoints against the vulnerability description data to determine which ones are
    affected. Processes that specifically overlap between this scenario and SACM use
    cases will be noted where applicable. Specifically, the relationship between this
    document and the SACM use case building block capabilities and the usage scenarios
    will be covered.</p>"
