abstract:
- content: "<p>New value-added IP services such as VoIP requires per-flow admission
    control to be performed in order to ensure the admission of new traffic flows
    does not degrade the performance of the existing traffic flows in the network.
    Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) for Intserv [2205] is proposed to support
    per-flow admission control. However, RSVP requires per-flow state installation,
    per-flow state refreshment, per-flow traffic management and resource reservation
    on each node along a forwarding path, which cause significant scalability issues,
    especially on the boundary routers and core routers of service providesâ€™ networks,
    which need to process thousands of traffic flows as network aggregation points.
    Intserv over Diffserv networks proposed in [2998] requires the RSVP/Intserv processing
    only on boundary routers and edge routers. Nevertheless, RSVP/Intserv has still
    rarely been supported by boundary router vendors because of the scalability issue.
    The use of edge-based admission control with per-class resource management and
    policy control offers a scalable approach to manage per-flow admission control
    for QoS sensitive applications.</p>"
