abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contributes to the ongoing discussion surrounding Internet
    consolidation. At recent IETF meetings discussions about Internet consolidation
    revealed that different perspectives gave completely different views of what consolidation
    means. While we use the term consolidation to refer to the process of increasing
    control over Internet infrastructure and services by a small set of organizations,
    it is clear that that control is expressed through economic, network traffic and
    protocol concerns. As a contribution to the discussion surrounding consolidation,
    this document attempts to provide a taxonomy of Internet consolidation with the
    goal of adding clarity to a complex discussion.</p>"
