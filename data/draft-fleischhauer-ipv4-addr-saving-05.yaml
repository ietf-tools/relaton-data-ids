abstract:
- content: "<p>Today the Dual-Stack approach is the most straightforward and the most
    common way for introducing IPv6 into existing systems and networks. However a
    typical drawback of implementing Dual-Stack is that each node will still require
    at least one IPv4 address. Hence, solely deploying Dual-Stack does not provide
    a sufficient solution to the IPv4 address exhaustion problem. Assuming a situation
    where most of the IP communication (e.g. always-on, VoIP etc.) can be provided
    via IPv6, the usage of public IPv4 addresses can significantly be reduced and
    the unused public IPv4 addresses can under certain circumstances be returned to
    the public IPv4 address pool of the service provider. New Dual-Stack enabled services
    can be introduced without increasing the public IPv4 address demand, whereas IPv6
    will be the preferred network layer protocol. This document describes such a solution
    in a Dual-Stack PPP session network scenario and explains the protocol mechanisms
    which are used.</p>"
