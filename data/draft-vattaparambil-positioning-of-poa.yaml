abstract:
- content: "<p>Power of Attorney (PoA) based authorization is a generic and decentralized
    subgranting based authorization technique. In this, a principal can grant limited
    credibilities for an agent to act on its behalf for some limited time and context.
    This can be used for example with semi-autonomous devices to have them act on
    behalf. PoA is a self-contained document that a principal sign and directs to
    an agent, thereby providing it the power to execute user actions on behalf of
    the principal for a predefined time. In this document, we compare PoA based authorization
    with different existing internet protocols for authorization and the relation
    with existing identity solutions.</p>"
