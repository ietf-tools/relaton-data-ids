abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been designed as a general
    purpose protocol for establishing and managing multimedia sessions. It provides
    many core functions and extensions in support of features such as transferring
    of calls, parking calls, and so on. However, interoperability of more advanced
    features between different vendors has been poor. This document describes the
    reason behind these interoperability problems, and presents a framework for addressing
    them.</p>"
