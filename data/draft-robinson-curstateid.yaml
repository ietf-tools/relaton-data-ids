abstract:
- content: "<p>The semantics of the NFSv4 server are changed to include tracking the
    value of current stateid in addition to the existing current filehandle. This
    will allow the stateid generated by one operation to be used by a subsequent operation
    without incurring an addition round trip operation.</p>"
