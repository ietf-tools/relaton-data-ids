abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing DTLS-SRTP specification allows SRTP keys to be established
    between a pair of SRTP endpoints. However, when there are more than two participants
    in an SRTP session, DTLS-SRTP is unable to provide a single key for all of the
    participants. This existing limitation of DTLS-SRTP prevents deploying DTLS-SRTP
    in certain scenarios. This document describes an extension to DTLS-SRTP called
    Key Transport (KTR). This extension transports SRTP keying material from one DTLS-SRTP
    peer to another, so the same SRTP keying material can be used by multiple DTLS-SRTP
    peers. This extension eliminates the need to key each SRTP session individually,
    allowing cost-effective deployment of several DTLS-SRTP scenarios.</p>"
