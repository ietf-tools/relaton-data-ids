abstract:
- content: <p>The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authentication
    and encryption of RADIUS packets. The protocol transports data "in the clear",
    although some parts of the packets can have "hidden" content. Packets may be replayed
    verbatim by an attacker, and client-server authentication is based on fixed shared
    secrets. This document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
    protocol may be used as a fix for these problems. It also describes how implementations
    of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUS systems.</p>
