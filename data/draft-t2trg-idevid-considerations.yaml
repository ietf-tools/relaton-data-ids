abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a taxonomy of methods used by manufacturers
    of silicon and devices to secure private keys and public trust anchors. This deals
    with two related activities: how trust anchors and private keys are installed
    into devices during manufacturing, and how the related manufacturer held private
    keys are secured against disclosure. This document does not evaluate the different
    mechanisms, but rather just serves to name them in a consistent manner in order
    to aid in communication. RFCEDITOR: please remove this paragraph. This work is
    occurring in https://github.com/mcr/idevid-security-considerations</p>"
