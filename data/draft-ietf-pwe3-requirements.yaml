abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes base requirements for the Pseudo-Wire Emulation
    Edge to Edge Working Group (PWE3 WG). It provides guidelines for other working
    group documents that will define mechanisms for providing pseudo-wire emulation
    of Ethernet, ATM, and Frame Relay. Requirements for pseudo-wire emulation of TDM
    (i.e., "synchronous bit streams at rates defined by ITU G.702") are defined in
    another document. It should be noted that the PWE3 WG standardizes mechanisms
    that can be used to provide PWE3 services, but not the services themselves. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
