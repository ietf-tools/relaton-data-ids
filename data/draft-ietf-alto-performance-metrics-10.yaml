abstract:
- content: <p>Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO), and is used in basic ALTO services including both the cost map service
    and the endpoint cost service. Different applications may use different cost metrics,
    but the ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] documents only one single cost metric, i.e.,
    the generic "routingcost" metric; see Sec. 14.2 of [RFC7285]. Hence, if the ALTO
    client of an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint cost request
    to determine the resource provider offering better delay performance (i.e., low-delay)
    to the resource consumer, the base protocol does not define the cost metric to
    be used. ALTO cost metrics can be generic metrics and this document focuses on
    network performance metrics, including network delay, jitter, packet loss rate,
    hop count, and bandwidth. When using an ALTO performance metric, an application
    may need additional contextual information beyond the metric value. For example,
    whether the metric is an estimation based on measurements or a service-level agreement
    (SLA) can define the meaning of the performance metric. Hence, this document introduces
    an additional "cost-context" field to the ALTO "cost-type" field to convey such
    information. To report an estimated value of a performance metric, the ALTO server
    may derive and aggregate from routing protocols with different granularity and
    scope, such as BGP-LS, OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from end-to-end traffic management
    tools. These metrics may then be exposed by an ALTO server to allow applications
    to determine "where" to connect based on network performance criteria.</p>
