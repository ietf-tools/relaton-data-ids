abstract:
- content: "<p>As one of well-known link-state protocols, OSPF has been widely used
    in the routing of intra domain networks. During the past decades, it has been
    deployed with the help of typical interfaces such as CLI, SNMP and NETCONF. As
    modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the necessity for rapid and dynamic
    control has been increased. The I2RS is a standard-based interface which provides
    a programmatic way to achieve this goal. This document specifies an information
    model for the OSPF protocol to facilitate the definition of a standardized data
    model, which can be used to define interfaces to the OSPF from an entity that
    may even be external to the routing system. Based on standardized data model and
    interfaces, use cases of IGP protocols defined by I2RS-WG can be supported.</p>"
