abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved in the design
    of a new transport protocol for multiplexed voice within a single packet. The
    intended application is the interconnection of devices which provide trunking
    or long distance telephone service over the Internet. Such devices have many voice
    connections simultaneously between them. Multiplexing them into the same connection
    improves on the efficiency, enables the use of low bitrate voice codecs, and improves
    scalability. Options and issues con- cerning timestamping, payload type identification,
    length indication, and channel identification are discussed. Sev- eral possible
    header formats are identified, and their efficiencies are compared.</p>"
