abstract:
- content: "<p>Demand for Ultra high-Reliability and Low-latency Communication (URLLC)
    and Broadband Assured IP Services (BAS) will grow as new service scenarios like
    5G, IoT, AR/VR, Cloud are deployed. As these new service scenarios will typically
    rely on shared packet infrastructure like Internet, methods to ensure URLLC and
    BAS performance across the underlying network resources will be required. This
    document outlines the motivation and key requirements for URLLC or BAS connectivity
    across heterogeneous network domains. It also outlines the corresponding models
    and architecture required for providing orchestrated URLLC or BAS communication.</p>"
