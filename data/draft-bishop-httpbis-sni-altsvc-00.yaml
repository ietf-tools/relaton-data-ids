abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP Alternative Services [AltSvc] provides a mechanism for an origin
    to declare that its content is accessible via some other combination of host,
    port, and protocol. In the process of using such an alternative, an observer can
    identify that the client is requesting resources from a particular hostname. This
    document extends HTTP Alternative Services, in combination with Secondary Certificate
    Authentication ([SecondaryCerts]), to enable clients not to disclose the origin
    to which they intend to connect.</p>"
