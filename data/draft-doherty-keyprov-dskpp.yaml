abstract:
- content: "<p>DSKPP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and configuration)
    of symmetric keys to locally and remotely accessible cryptographic modules. The
    protocol can be run with or without private-key capabilities in the cryptographic
    modules, and with or without an established public-key infrastructure. Three variations
    of the protocol support multiple usage scenarios. The four-pass (i.e., two round-trip)
    variant enables key generation in near real-time. With the four-pass variant,
    keys are mutually generated by the provisioning server and cryptographic module;
    provisioned keys are not transferred over-the-wire or over-the-air. Two- and one-pass
    variants enable secure and efficient download and installation of symmetric keys
    to a cryptographic module in environments where near real-time communication may
    not be possible. This document builds on information contained in [RFC4758], adding
    specific enhancements in response to implementation experience and liaison requests.
    It is intended, therefore, that this document or a successor version thereto will
    become the basis for subsequent progression of a symmetric key provisioning protocol
    specification on the standards track.</p>"
