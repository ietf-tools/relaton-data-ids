abstract:
- content: "<p>This document moves Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) [RFC6045]
    to Historic status as it provides minor updates. Security incidents, such as system
    compromises, worms, viruses, phishing incidents, and denial of service, typically
    result in the loss of service, data, and resources both human and system. Service
    providers and Computer Security Incident Response Teams need to be equipped and
    ready to assist in communicating and tracing security incidents with tools and
    procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack. Real-time Inter-network
    Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network communication method to facilitate
    sharing incident handling data while integrating existing detection, tracing,
    source identification, and mitigation mechanisms for a complete incident handling
    solution. Combining these capabilities in a communication system provides a way
    to achieve higher security levels on networks. Policy guidelines for handling
    incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the security
    recommendations and considerations.</p>"
