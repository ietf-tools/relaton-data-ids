abstract:
- content: "<p>As a major transport protocol of current Internet, TCP has the problem
    of the large header overhead on bandwidth-limited links. Header compression has
    been proven to be efficient for using TCP over bandwidth-limited reliable links.
    Unfortunately, existing TCP/IP header compression schemes do not work well on
    noisy links, especially the one with high bit error rate and long roundtrip time.
    In addition, existing schemes [2, 3] have not addressed some TCP options such
    as SACK [4, 5] and Timestamps [6].</p>"
