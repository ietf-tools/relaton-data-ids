abstract:
- content: "<p>A low-rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) is a network designed
    for low-cost and very low-power short-range wireless communications. It is hard
    to employ static routes. Route discovery is the procedure whereby network devices
    cooperate to find and establish routes through the network and is always performed
    with regard to a particular source and destination device. However, Route discovery
    in LR-WPAN has lack of authentication mechanism. Also, dynamic network topology
    makes it arduous to detect malicious nodes. We proposed a secure route discovery
    authentication mechanism using the ¥ìSRD. ¥ìSRD uses RREQ ID, destination address
    and the unique value as input string to generate authentication code (AC). It
    is used as the authentication between source node and destination node.</p>"
