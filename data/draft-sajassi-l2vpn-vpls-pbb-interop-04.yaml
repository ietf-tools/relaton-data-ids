abstract:
- content: <p>The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be improved
    by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) functionality in VPLS access.
    PBB has been standardized as IEEE 802.1ah-2008, which is an amendment to 802.1Q
    to improve the scalability of MAC addresses and service instances in Provider
    Ethernet networks. This document describes different interoperability scenarios
    where IEEE 802.1ah functionality is used in H-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS access
    network to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses
    and number of service instances. The document also describes the scenarios and
    the mechanisms for incorporating PBB functionality within H-VPLS with existing
    IEEE 802.1ad (aka QinQ) Ethernet access and interoperability among them. Furthermore,
    the document discusses the migration mechanisms and scenarios by which PBB functionality
    can be incorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access. Conventions used in
    this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
