abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2544 has defined a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect
    devices. RFC 5180 addressed IPv6 specificities and it also provided a technology
    update, but excluded IPv6 transition technologies. RFC 8219 addressed IPv6 transition
    technologies, including stateful NAT64. However, none of them discussed how to
    apply RFC 4814 pseudorandom port numbers to any stateful NATxy (NAT44, NAT64,
    NAT66) technologies. We discuss why using pseudorandom port numbers with stateful
    NATxy gateways is a difficult problem. We recommend a solution limiting the port
    number ranges and using two phases: the preliminary phase and the real test phase.
    We show how the classic performance measurement procedures (e.g. throughput, frame
    loss rate, latency, etc.) can be carried out. We also define new performance metrics
    and measurement procedures for maximum connection establishment rate, connection
    tear down rate and connection tracking table capacity measurements.</p>"
