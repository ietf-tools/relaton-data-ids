abstract:
- content: "<p>Many providers operate ATM networks that support a suite of network
    services. These networks employ ATM signaling and routing protocols to expedite
    connection setup and recovery. Over time these providers will migrate all or portions
    of their ATM infrastructure and services to an IP/MPLS-based Packet Switched Network
    (PSN) thus leading to the creation of ATM L2VPNs. This document describes a solution
    that supports dynamic signaling and routing of point-to-point switched ATM connections
    (i.e. VP or VC) across an IP/MPLS network. It is based on the L2VPN (VPWS) architecture
    which employs an {attachment circuit, PE, pseudo-wire, PE, attachment circuit}
    tuple to define a distinct point- to-point L2 connection between two end-points
    within the VPN [PPVPN L2]. The presumption is that the L2 connection is a switched
    ATM VC or VP and that one or both ACs and the PW are established in real-time
    using routing and signaling protocol machinery native to the ATM and IP/MPLS networks.
    We call this a switched ATM L2VPN. The key component of a switched ATM L2VPN is
    a PWE3 native service processing (NSP) function on the PE that serves as an interworking
    gateway between native ATM and IP/MPLS signaling and routing protocols. The NSP
    learns of ATM prefixes reachable through the local attachment circuits. The ATM
    prefixes are exchanged with a co-resident MP-BGP instance for automatic distribution
    and discovery of ATM reachability to participating PEs and their directly-attached
    ATM networks. The NSP is capable of processing the necessary native ATM signaling
    messages for real-time connection management. The NSP interacts with the co- resident
    PWE3 signaling machinery for concurrent PW connection management. Extensions to
    the PWE3 signaling protocol are required to support dynamic single-sided provisioning
    and to transport ATM signaling parameters between the NSPs for connection management
    purposes. Extensions to the MP-BGP protocol are needed distribute ATM prefixes
    and associated next hop information between PEs.</p>"
