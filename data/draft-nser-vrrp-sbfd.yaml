abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the VRRP protocol depends on the availability of Layer 3 IPvX
    connectivity between redundant peers, the VRRP protocol can interact with the
    variant of S-BFD as described in [RFC7881] to achieve a much faster failure detection.
    This document describes how to extend the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
    to support Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) as a detection
    system for Primary Router failure. To announce the use of this implementation,
    a new type (Section 5.2.2.) of VRRP packet and a new timer are defined. To facilitate
    and increase the user experience while deploying this implementation, an auto-calculation
    algorithm for the SBFD Discriminators is also implemented.</p>"
