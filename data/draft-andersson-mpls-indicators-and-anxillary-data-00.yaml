abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a living document, meaning that during the life timme
    of the MPLS Open Design Team we will to survey the relationship between indicators
    and anxillary dat. Ideally when the Design Team is closed this document will be
    empty, or maybe we just add a pointer to where the answer to quesstion is documented.
    Thus this document will never go on to become an RFCc.</p>"
