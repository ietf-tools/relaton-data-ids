abstract:
- content: "<p>The home network is an environment subject to ongoing evolution and
    change. Many home networks today are simplistic in nature, often comprising of
    a single router/gateway. The expectation over time is predicated on the notion
    that the home network will be more complex servicing many in-home and Internet
    functions. The home network will evolve necessitating the replacement and update
    to current hardware and software to more advanced devices and software capable
    of operating in more complex environments. This document provides a view on how
    the home network can progress from today's foundational form, to a more advanced
    environment, using progressive technological capabilities.</p>"
