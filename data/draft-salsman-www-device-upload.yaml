abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, HTML forms allow the producer of the form to request information,
    including files of data, from the operator using the form. However, this capability
    is limited because HTML forms don't provide a way to ask the operator to submit
    input from arbitrary sources such as audio devices like microphones. Since input
    and upload from various devices is a feature that will benefit many applications,
    this draft proposes an extension to the HTML INPUT type='file' form element. Motivations
    include language instruction assistance, voice transcription, and high-quality
    speech transmission under low-bandwidth conditions.</p>"
