abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests public policy questions that the IETF should
    consider and possibly address when developing new standards and protocols, and
    modifying or enhancing old standards and protocols. This document contains questions
    to be considered, as opposed to guidelines or rules that should in all cases be
    followed. This first draft provides a framework for identifying and discussing
    questions of public policy concern, and invites members of the IETF community
    to contribute to the questions and discussions raised here.</p>"
