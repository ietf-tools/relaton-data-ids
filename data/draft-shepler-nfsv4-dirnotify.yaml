abstract:
- content: "<p>NFSv4 [RFC3530] contains within it a mechanism for the delegation of
    file data to a client. The intent of this feature is to reduce the necessary interaction
    between a client and server such that overall performance is improved. The same
    type of mechanism does not exist for directory contents and to determine validity
    of cached directory contents an NFSv4 client is left with polling the server to
    determine if updates have occurred. The proposal described here is for an NFSv4
    minor version that would allow a client to register interest in a directory and
    to receive a callback RPC upon update of that directory. This type of interaction
    would reduce or eliminate the polling that occurs between client and server and
    improve scalability of the server's resources along with improved performance
    for the client's directory content caching.</p>"
