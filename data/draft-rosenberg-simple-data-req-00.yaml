abstract:
- content: "<p>In an instant messaging and presence application, it is frequently
    necessary for the user to configure a number of pieces of information. Users will
    need to manipulate their buddy list, adding and removing presentities, and manipulate
    their authorization lists, which specify the set of users that can subscribe to
    their presence. In this document, we provide a set of requirements for such data
    manipulations, and provide a framework for viewing them in a common way.</p>"
