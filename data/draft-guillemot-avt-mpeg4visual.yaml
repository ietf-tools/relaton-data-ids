abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a payload format for the transport of MPEG-4
    visual Elementary Streams, applicable for multimedia applications not restricted
    to the simple visual profile. It is an application of the format described in
    [1] to specialized cases of video which are applicable in the H.323 context (using
    for example MPEG-4 lay- ered streams). It is therefore intended to support advanced
    MPEG-4 visual profiles (simple scalable, core, main, N-bits profiles), by allowing
    protection against loss of key segments of the elementary streams. The simple
    scalable profile supports temporal and spatial scalability, features important
    for rate or congestion control on the Internet, especially in multicast. The core
    and the main visual profiles target multimedia applications on the Internet and
    allow, in addition to scalability, the usage of sprite objects and of arbitrary
    shape objects.</p>"
