abstract:
- content: "<p>Network edge applications such as subscriber termination, firewalls,
    tunnel switching, intrusion detection, and routing are currently provided using
    dedicated network function hardware. As network function is migrated from dedicated
    hardware platforms into a virtualized environment, a set of use cases with application
    specific requirements begin to emerge. These use cases and requirements cover
    a broad range of capability and objectives, which will require detailed investigation
    and documentation in order to identify relevant architecture, protocol and procedure
    solutions. This document provides an analysis of the key management requirements
    for applications that may be hosted within a virtualized environment. These engineering
    requirements are based on a variety of goals including: virtual application security,
    reliability, scalability, performance, management and automation. Note that this
    document is not intended to provide or recommend solutions.</p>"
