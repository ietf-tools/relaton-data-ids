abstract:
- content: <p>The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration systems
    poses a challenge as managing secrets, such as client_id and client_secret, can
    be complex and error-prone. "Service account token volume projection", a term
    introduced by Kubernetes, provides a way of injecting JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to
    workloads. This document specifies the use of JWTs for client credentials in container
    orchestration systems to improve interoperability in orchestration systems, to
    reduce complexity for developers, and motivates authorization server to support
    RFC 7523.</p>
