abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism to encode relevant data for
    NS records on the parental side of a zone cut by encoding them in DS records based
    on a new DNSKEY algorithm. Since DS records are signed by the parent, this creates
    a method for validation of the otherwise unsigned delegation records. Notably,
    support for updating DS records in a parent zone is already present (by necessity)
    in the Registry-Registrar-Registrant (RRR) provisioning system, EPP. Thus, no
    changes to the EPP protocol are needed, and no changes to registry database or
    publication systems upstream of the DNS zones published by top level domains (TLDs).
    This NS validation mechanism is beneficial if the name server _names_ need to
    be validated prior to use.</p>"
