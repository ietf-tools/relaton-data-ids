abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a SIP framework used for advertising and searching
    for shared resources, such as services or files, within a given community. The
    memo defines the signaling used by users to signal the availability of resources
    stored in their User Agents (UA). It also provides the signaling for users to
    perform searches of available resources and monitor changes in existing resources.
    Additionally, we provide the signaling used to access a resource. These methods
    can be used in (but are not limited to) SIP peer-to- peer systems based on centralized,
    semi-centralized or fully distributed architectures.</p>"
