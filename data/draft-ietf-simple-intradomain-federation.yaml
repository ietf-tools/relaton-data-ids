abstract:
- content: "<p>Presence and Instant Messaging (IM) bridging involves the sharing of
    presence information and exchange of IM across multiple systems within a single
    domain. As such, it is a close cousin to presence and IM federation, which involves
    the sharing of presence and IM across differing domains. Presence and IM bridging
    can be the result of a multi-vendor network, or a consequence of a large organization
    that requires partitioning. This document examines different use cases and models
    for intra-domain presence and IM bridging. It is meant to provide a framework
    for defining requirements and specifications for presence and IM bridging. The
    document assumes SIP as the underlying protocl but many of the modles can fit
    other protocols as well.</p>"
