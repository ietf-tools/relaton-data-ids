abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework to negotiate end-to-end the 'Quality'
    of a multimedia session 'as the end-user to perceive it'. This UPQoS (User Perceived
    QoS) negotiation is achieved at session signaling level using two types of new
    SDP extensions, which this document proposes to specify. All session control elements
    - user agents as well as proxies - involved in the multimedia session setup may
    participate to the UPQoS negotiation</p>"
