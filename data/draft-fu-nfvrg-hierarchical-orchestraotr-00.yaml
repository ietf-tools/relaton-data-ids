abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses about the framework of Orchestrator in the
    NFV deployment. A hierarchical framework of Orchestrator is then proposed. Such
    framework is very important for large scale NFV deployment in Operator networks,
    since multi-site of NFV deployment and management should be considered. This draft
    will further discuss the responsibilities of the multi-layers of the Orchestrator
    and the interfaces between them.</p>"
