abstract:
- content: "<p>In many protocols, such as IP Paging [1] and PANA [2], there is the
    need for the user to discover an agent in the network: In IP Paging, the user
    first needs to discover the address of the Paging agent in order to perform Paging
    registration, Paging Area Update and other paging procedures. In the same way,
    in PANA, the user first needs to discover the PANA Authentication Agent to know
    where to send its credential. This document describes an efficient method for
    a user to discover one, or many agents in the network.</p>"
