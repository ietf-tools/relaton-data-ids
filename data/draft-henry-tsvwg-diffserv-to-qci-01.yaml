abstract:
- content: "<p>As communication devices become more hybrid, smart devices include
    more media-rich communication applications, and the boundaries between telecommunication
    and other applications becomes less clear. Simultaneously, as the end-devices
    become more mobile, application traffic transits more often between enterprise
    networks, the Internet, and cellular telecommunication networks. In this context,
    it is crucial that quality of service be aligned between these different environments.
    However, this is not always the case by default, and cellular communication networks
    use a different QoS nomenclature from the Internet and enterprise networks. This
    document specifies a set of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Quality
    of Service (QoS) Class Identifiers (QCI) to Differentiated Services Code Point
    (DSCP) mappings, to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by the 3GPP
    with the recommendations offered by the IETF, so as to maintain a consistent QoS
    treatment between cellular networks and the Internet.</p>"
