abstract:
- content: "<p>This contribution describes a carriers optical services framework and
    associated requirements for the User-Network Interface (UNI). It is intended to
    provide carrier specific service requirements for the automatic switched optical
    networks to guide the on-going efforts to develop the standard UNI and other interfaces
    to the optical layer (OL) control plane. Due to time constraints, no attempt has
    been made to provide detailed comprehensive requirements; instead we focused on
    topics of particular interest or concern to the carrier community. This is a work-in-progress
    document and is expected to evolve in near term as new requirements are identified
    and further studied.</p>"
