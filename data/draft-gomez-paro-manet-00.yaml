abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to fact that mobile ad hoc nodes have a critical need to preserve
    battery power, MANET routing protocols need to consider power saving techniques
    during operations. In this Internet-Draft we discuss PARO, a Power-Aware Routing
    Optimization protocol that minimizes the transmission power necessary to forward
    packets between wireless devices. Using PARO, intermediate nodes can forward packets
    between source-destination pairs thus reducing the aggregate transmission power
    consumed by wireless devices. An important property of PARO is that it outperforms
    traditional broadcast-based routing protocols due to its power efficient point-to-point
    on-demand nature. The protocol is designed to operate as a stand-alone multihop
    routing protocol for local-area wireless networks (e.g., single-hop home networks,
    single- hop sensor networks, WLANs, etc.) and as a power-aware enhancement for
    routing in wide-area MANETs.</p>"
