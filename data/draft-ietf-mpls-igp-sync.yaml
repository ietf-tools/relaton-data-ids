abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks there is a dependency on edge-to-edge LSPs setup
    by LDP, e.g. networks that are used for MPLS VPN applications. For such applications
    it is not possible to rely on IP forwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately.
    Blackholing of labeled traffic can occur in situations where the IGP is operational
    on a link but LDP is not operational on that link. While the link could still
    be used for IP forwarding, it is not useful for traffic with packets carrying
    a label stack of more than one label or when the IP address carried in the packet
    is out of the RFC1918 space. This document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic
    loss due to this condition without introducing any protocol changes.</p>"
