abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to manage (i.e., set up, distribute,
    and rekey) keys used with symmetric cryptographic algorithms. Also defined herein
    is a mechanism to organize users into groups to support distribution of encrypted
    content using symmetric cryptographic algorithms. The mechanism uses the Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) protocol and Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) protocol
    to manage the symmetric keys. Any member of the group can then later use this
    distributed shared key to decrypt other CMS encrypted objects with the symmetric
    key. This mechanism has been developed to support Secure/Multipurpose Internet
    Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Mail List Agents (MLAs). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
