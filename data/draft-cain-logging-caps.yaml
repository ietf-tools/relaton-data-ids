abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists logging capabilities originally defined in RFC3871
    and needed to support the current practices, including those described in the
    Operational Security Current Practices document[CURPRAC] Logging is defined as
    the delivery to another entity or system of messages about the device, the data
    passing through the device, or the device's interaction with another device. Capabilities
    are defined without reference to specific technologies. This is done to leave
    room for deployment of new technologies that implement the capability. Each capability
    cites the practices it supports. Current implementations that support the capability
    are cited. Special considerations are discussed as appropriate listing operational
    and resource constraints, limitations of current implementations, trade offs,
    etc.</p>"
