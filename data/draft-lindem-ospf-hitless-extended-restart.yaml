abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents an enhancement to OSPF 'hitless restart' whereby
    an OSPF router can request that its forwarding state be maintained longer that
    the router dead interval on one or more router interfaces. This is useful when
    the OSPF software is being updated and the router dead interval on one or more
    interfaces is configured to a small value.</p>"
