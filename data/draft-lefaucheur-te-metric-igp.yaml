abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a common practice on how the existing IGP Metric
    can be used as an alternative metric to the TE Metric for Constraint Based Routing
    of MPLS TE Tunnels. This effectively results in the ability to perform Constraint
    Based Routing with optimization of one metric (e.g. link bandwidth) for some TE
    Tunnels (e.g. Data Trunks) while optimizing another metric (e.g. propagation delay)
    for some other TE Tunnels with different requirements (e.g. Voice Trunks). No
    protocol extensions or modifications are required. This text documents current
    router implementations and deployment practices.</p>"
