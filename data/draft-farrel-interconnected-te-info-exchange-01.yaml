abstract:
- content: "<p>In Traffic Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish
    an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one
    or more network from a source to a destination. TE information is the data relating
    to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path. The
    availability of TE information is usually limited to within a network (such as
    an IGP area) often referred to as a domain. In order to determine the potential
    to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary
    to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network. This
    need not be the full set of TE information available within each network, but
    does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity. This subset of
    TE information is called TE reachability information. This document sets out the
    problem statement and architecture for the exchange of TE information between
    interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment. For
    reasons that are explained in the document, this work is limited to simple TE
    constraints and information that determine TE reachability.</p>"
