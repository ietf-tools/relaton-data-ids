abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP specification establishes the mechanisms that enable
    a mobile host to maintain and use the same IP address as it changes its point
    of attachment to the network. The mechanisms described in this document allow
    a mobile node out on a public sector of the internet to negotiate access past
    a SKIP firewall, and construct a secure channel into its home network. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an
    Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
