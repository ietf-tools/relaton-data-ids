abstract:
- content: "<p>The Reliable Multicast Transport Working Group has been chartered to
    standardize multicast transport services. This working group expects to initially
    standardize three protocol instantiations. This draft is concerned with the requirements
    of the tree-based ACK protocol. In particular, it is concerned with defining the
    building block for auto-configuration of the logical ACK-tree. According to the
    charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained modular component that is common
    to multiple protocols along with abstract APIs that define a building block's
    access methods and their arguments.' For more information, see the Reliable Multicast
    Transport Building Blocks and Reliable Multicast Design Space documents [WLKHFL01][HWKFV00].</p>"
