abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals of 'content peering' is to allow content providers
    to receive detailed information on the utilization of their content in remote
    networks. In order to provide this, a simple, commonly accepted log format must
    be used on systems that deliver content. Also, a commonly accepted mechanism is
    required to pass these logs between networks. This draft proposes a log format
    and log passing mechanism specifically for HTTP content.</p>"
