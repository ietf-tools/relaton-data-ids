abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last year, the Internet community has slowly come to realize
    that the IANA and RIR IPv4 free address pool will be exhausted within no more
    than 3-4 years, and possibly sooner. At that point, it will become increasingly
    difficult for ISPs and end sites to obtain the public IPv4 address space they
    need to expand operations. IPv6 was developed to address the IPv4 address exhaustion
    problem, but widespread deployment has barely begun. This document reiterates
    the IETF's support and continued commitment to IPv6. IPv6 deployment is still
    necessary to ensure the continued growth and expansion of the Internet. Deployment
    of IPv6 is needed to preserve important Internet properties that have made it
    a success and enable new generations of applications and services.</p>"
