abstract:
- content: "<p>A small percentage of HTTP URIs contain an IPv4 address literal as
    the hostname which is not accessible to IPv6-only HTTP clients using an IPv6/IPv4
    translator and DNS64. This document proposes a workaround for this problem using
    an HTTP proxy to handle that traffic.</p>"
