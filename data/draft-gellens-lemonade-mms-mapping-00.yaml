abstract:
- content: "<p>The cellular telephone industry has defined a service known as the
    Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). This service uses formats and protocols which
    are similar to, but differ in key ways from those used in Internet mail. This
    document specifies how to exchange messages between these two services, including
    mapping information elements as used in MMS X-MMS-* headers to and from that used
    in ESMTP and Internet message headers.</p>"
