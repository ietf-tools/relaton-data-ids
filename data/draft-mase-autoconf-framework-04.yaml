abstract:
- content: <p>We consider the unique address/prefix autoconfiguration problem for
    MANETs. Specifically, we consider two cases. First, a node without a pre-assigned
    and valid local address/prefix acquires a new local address/prefix and becomes
    a member of a new or existing MANET. Second, two or more MANETs merge. In the
    first case, a mechanism of IP address/prefix generation is needed. We may have
    MANET-wide duplicate address/prefix detection (DAD) on newly generated address/
    prefix (tentative address/prefix) for suppressing occurrence of address/prefix
    conflict with existing address/prefixes (pre-service DAD). In the second case,
    duplicate address/prefix may occur as the result of a merger of two formerly independent
    networks. We may have DAD on addresses/prefixes in use for detecting and resolving
    duplicate addresses/prefixes and suppressing routing information contamination
    due to existence of duplicate addresses/prefixes (in- service DAD). To define
    pre-service DAD and in-service DAD, we use autoconfiguration phases that are common
    for both proactive and reactive routing protocol. Each node exists in one of the
    autoconfiguration phases at any time. A node, that detects duplicate address/prefix
    between other nodes, may advertise the detected duplicate address/prefix to all
    other nodes in the MANET. This is termed "Duplicate address/prefix advertisement"
    (DAA). The specific DAD and DAA algorithm is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
