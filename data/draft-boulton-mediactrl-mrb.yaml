abstract:
- content: "<p>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently proposing an architecture
    for controlling media services. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) will be
    used as the signalling protocol which provides many inherent capabilities for
    message routing. In addition to such signalling properties, a need exists for
    intelligent, application level media service selection based on non-static signalling
    properties. This is especially true when considered in conjunction with deployment
    architectures that include 1:M and M:M combinations of Application Servers and
    Media Servers.</p>"
