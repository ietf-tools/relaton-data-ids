abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines method for negotiation of a set of capabilities
    specific to a Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Hello Adjacency. The document
    uses the TLVs for the LDP Capabilities defined in [RFC5561] to be used for exchanging
    capabilities over LDP Hello Adjacencies. The Hello Adjacency capabilities can
    be thought of as "Traffic Forwarding Capabilities" (TFC). Some capabilties already
    exist that can be re-used for hello adjacency specific capabilities and it is
    likely that some may be defined in future. This document defines the mechanism
    to advertise LDP TFCs for a hello adjacency as well as mechanism to enable and
    disable TFCs after a hello adjacency is formed between LDP peers.</p>
