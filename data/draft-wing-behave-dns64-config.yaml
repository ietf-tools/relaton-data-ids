abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and IPv6-only
    hosts at the same time. Such networks also want to IPv6/ IPv4 translation for
    the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on the IPv4 Internet. On such a network,
    the synthesized AAAA responses from a DNS64 can cause traffic to be translated.
    This document describes a solution to avoid that translation when the application
    uses DNS.</p>"
