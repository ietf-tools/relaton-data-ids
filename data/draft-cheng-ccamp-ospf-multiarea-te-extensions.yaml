abstract:
- content: "<p>The [MULTI-AREA] introduces a set of mechanisms that could be used
    to construct LSPs that span multiple IS-IS/OSPF areas, where one scenario is to
    allow the head-end LSR to compute the path all the way to the ABR in the tail-end
    area. This document proposes some new OSPF extensions that can be used in supporting
    that scenario, i.e., by leaking some of the useful information from individual
    areas to others, the constraint-based routing at the head-end LSR of LSPs in OSPF
    networks with multiple areas can be optimized.</p>"
