abstract:
- content: "<p>When small payloads are transmitted through a packet-switched network,
    the resulting overhead may result significant. This is stressed in the case of
    LISP, where a number of headers are prepended to a packet, as new headers have
    to be added to each packet. This document proposes to send together a number of
    small packets, which are in the buffer of a ITR, having the same ETR as destination,
    into a single packet. Therefore, they will share a single LISP header, and therefore
    bandwidth savings can be obtained, and a reduction in the overall number of packets
    sent to the network can be achieved.</p>"
