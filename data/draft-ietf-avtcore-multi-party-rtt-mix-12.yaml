abstract:
- content: <p>Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the
    source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be presented by
    endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the same source, while new
    text from other sources is also presented in readable grouping as received interleaved
    in real-time. Use of RTT is increasing, and specifically, use in emergency calls
    is increasing. Emergency call use requires multi-party mixing. RFC 4103 "RTP Payload
    for Text Conversation" mixer implementations can use traditional RTP functions
    for source identification, but the performance of the mixer when giving turns
    for the different sources to transmit is limited when using the default transmission
    characteristics with redundancy. Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing
    are provided in this document, suitable for a centralized conference model that
    enables source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text from
    different sources. The intended use is for real-time text mixers and participant
    endpoints capable of providing an efficient presentation or other treatment of
    a multi-party real-time text session. The specified mechanism builds on the standard
    use of the CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification. The method makes
    use of the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats as for two- party sessions.
    Solutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP session are briefly mentioned,
    as they could have some benefits over the RTP- mixer model. The possibility to
    implement the solution in a wide range of existing RTP implementations made the
    RTP-mixer model be selected to be fully specified in this document. A capability
    exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a mixer and a participant
    can handle the multi-party coded real-time text stream using the RTP-mixer method.
    The capability is indicated by use of an SDP media attribute "rtt-mixer". The
    document updates RFC 4103 "RTP Payload for Text Conversation". A specification
    of how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint is not multi-party
    aware is also provided.</p>
