abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the requirements for implementing PIM Source-
    Only (PIM-SO) which will allow the creation of source-based multicast trees across
    multiple domains in the Internet. PIM-SO realizes the EXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast
    service model in which there is a single source for every multicast group, and
    group membership and addressing is based on a multicast group address (G) as well
    as the source's unicast address (S). Our short-term goal is to implement PIM-SO
    with minimal changes to the current multicast routing infrastructure by August
    2000, and to provide proof of concept by deploying it on Sprintlab's experimental
    network. By the end of the year, we envisage that PIM-SO will be ready to be incorporated
    in Sprint's multicast backbone as a commercial point-to-multipoint service.</p>"
