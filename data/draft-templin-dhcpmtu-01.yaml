abstract:
- content: "<p>IP fragmentation has been shown to be problematic through operational
    experience and through studies conducted over the course of many years. Some transports
    (e.g., TCP) have the abilitiy to adjust their message sizes to avoid IP fragmentation,
    however no such capability is built into the UDP transport. UDP applications such
    as DHCP must therefore have a means to perform their own segmentation prior to
    submitting their data to UDP/IP in order to avoid IP fragmentation. This document
    specifies a segmentation/reassembly capability for DHCP using SEAL.</p>"
