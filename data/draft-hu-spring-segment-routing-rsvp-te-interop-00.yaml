abstract:
- content: "<p>A Segment Routing (SR) node steers a packet through an ordered list
    of instructions, called segments. A segment can represent any instruction, topological
    or service-based. Segment Routing (SR) is a protocol designed to forward packets
    on the network based on the concept of source routing. The Segment Routing architecture
    can be directly applied to the MPLS data plane with no change in the forwarding
    plane. It simplifies the MPLS control protocol, simplifies the configuration of
    the network, and can achieve SDN better. Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE) has the ability of path planning and resource reservation.
    In the process of traditional network evolution to Segment Routing, there will
    inevitably be coexistence of RSVP-TE and Segment Routing. The Document describes
    how to interact with nodes that support Segment Routing capabilities and nodes
    that support RSVP-TE capabilities.</p>"
