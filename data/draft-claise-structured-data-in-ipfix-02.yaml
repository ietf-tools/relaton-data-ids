abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an extension to IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)
    protocol specification in [RFC5101] and the IPFIX information model specified
    in [RFC5102] to support hierarchical structured data and lists (sequences) of
    Information Elements in data records. This extension allows definition of complex
    data structures such as variable-length lists and specification of hierarchical
    containment relationships between Templates. Conventions used in this document
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. &lt;Claise, et. Al&gt; Expires
