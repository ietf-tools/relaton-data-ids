abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a feature that significantly decreases the initial
    LSDB synchronization time in Broadcast Multiple Access (BMA) environments. This
    implementation only requires a single OSPF speaker per psuedo-node to support
    this functionality. These changes are implicitly supported within the OSPFv2 protocol.
    This memo is not intended to serve as a model for any other implementation.</p>"
