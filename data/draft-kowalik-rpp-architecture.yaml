abstract:
- content: "<p>Advancements in development, integration, deployment environments and
    operational paradigms have led to a desire for an alternative for the Extensible
    Provisioning Protocol (EPP). This document defines the architecture for the RESTful
    Provisioning Protocol (RPP) an HTTP based provisioning protocol leveraging the
    REST architectural style and JSON data-interchange format, aiming to standardize
    a RESTful protocol for provisioning database objects. The architecture includes
    support for extensibility, allowing for multiple possible use cases. RPP is intended
    to co-exist with EPP, offering an alternative protocol including data model compatibility
    with EPP core objects and the benefits associated with the REST architectural
    style and widely adopted HTTP-based technologies.</p>"
