abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, a proactive correspondent registration mechanism
    is proposed for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) route optimization between the
    correspondent node (CN) and the mobile access gateway (MAG) on behalf of the mobile
    node (MN). Two scenarios are considered according to the type of CN. For the proposed
    mechanism, the proxy home test and the concurrent care-of test are defined newly
    with parameters specified by information on candidate MAGs. The proposed correspondent
    registration mechanism is performed before actual handover for candidate MAGs
    where the MN can attach newly. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can reduce correspondent
    registration latency, which can reduce handover latency and thus enhance throughput
    degradation caused by the bidirectional tunneling via the local mobility anchor
    (LMA).</p>"
