abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a performance comparison between the per-domain
    path computation method and the Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture-based
    Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) procedure. Metrics to capture the significant
    performance aspects are identified, and detailed simulations are carried out on
    realistic scenarios. A performance analysis for each of the path computation methods
    is then undertaken. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
