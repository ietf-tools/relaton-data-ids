abstract:
- content: <p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
    of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor the new incoming
    algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the required data lifetimes.
    The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptanalysis,
    while the incoming post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
    mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that have not had
    sufficient maturing time to rule out classical cryptanalytic attacks and implementation
    bugs. Cautious implementers may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such that
    an attacker would need to break all of them in order to compromise the data being
    protected using either a Post-Quantum / Traditional Hybrid, Post-Quantum / Post-Quantum
    Hybrid, or combinations thereof. This document, and its companions, defines a
    specific instantiation of hybrid paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic
    algorithms are combined to form a single key, signature, or key encapsulation
    mechanism (KEM) such that they can be treated as a single atomic object at the
    protocol level. This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue,
    and CompositeSignatureParams, which are sequences of the respective structure
    for each component algorithm. The explicit variant is defined which allows for
    a set of signature algorithm identifier OIDs to be registered together as an explicit
    composite signature algorithm and assigned an OID. The generic composite variant
    is also defined which allows arbitrary combinations of signature algorithms to
    be used in the CompositeSignatureValue and CompositeSignatureParams structures
    without needing the combination to be pre-registered or pre-agreed. This document
    is intended to be coupled with corresponding documents that define the structure
    and semantics of composite public and private keys and encryption [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys],
    however may also be used with non-composite keys, such as when a protocol combines
    multiple certificates into a single cryptographic operation.</p>
