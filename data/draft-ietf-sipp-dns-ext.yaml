abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain
    Name System to support hosts running Simple Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP). A new
    resource record type is defined to store a SIPP address sequence and a new inverse
    lookup domain is used to store the inverse mapping. The definitions of existing
    query types that return Internet addresses as part of additional section processing
    are also updated. The extensions are intended to be compatible with existing applications
    and name server/resolver implementations.</p>"
