abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes needs for hierarchical mobile router advertisement
    for nested mobile networks. When ingress and egress interfaces of a Mobile Router
    are both wireless, the MR cannot distinguish the Router Advertisement of the parent
    MR from the RA of the child MR. To maintain hierarchical information of wireless
    nested mobile networks, RA message needs to be extended to deliver additional
    information for hierarchy.</p>"
