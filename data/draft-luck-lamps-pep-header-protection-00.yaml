abstract:
- content: "<p>Issues with email header protection in S/MIME have been recently raised
    in the IETF LAMPS Working Group. The need for amendments to the existing specification
    regarding header protection was expressed. The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) implementations
    currently use a mechanism quite similar to the currently standardized message
    wrapping for S/MIME. The main difference is that pEp is using PGP/ MIME instead.
    In LAMPS also voices have been expressed, that whatever mechanism will be choosen,
    it should not be limited to S/MIME, but also applied to PGP/MIME. This document
    aims to contribute to this discussion and share pEp implementation experience
    with email header protection.</p>"
