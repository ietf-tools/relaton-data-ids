abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an update to the round-trip time (RTT) estimation
    algorithm used for TFRC (TCP-Friendly Rate Control) congestion control by the
    Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). It updates specifications for the
    CCID-3 and CCID-4 Congestion Control IDs of DCCP. The update addresses parameter-estimation
    problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP congestion control. It uses a recommendation
    made in the original TFRC specification to avoid the inherent problems of receiver-based
    RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already available at the
    sender. It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end negotiable
    extension. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
