abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP is comprised
    of three main components: 1. A method for encapsulating multi-protocol datagrams.
    2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and testing the
    data-link connection. 3. A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing
    and configuring different network-layer protocols. This document defines an interoperable
    method for the authentication of peers during the Link negotiation phase.</p>"
