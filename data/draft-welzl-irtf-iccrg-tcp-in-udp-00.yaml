abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method to encapsulate multiple TCP connections
    using only one UDP port number pair. Doing so allows for a relatively easy implementation
    of coupled congestion control for the TCP connections. This can have several performance
    benefits, and it makes it possible to precisely assign a share of the congestion
    window to the connections based on priorities. It also enables use of UDP-based
    NAT traversal techniques, and it can act as a framework for experimentation with
    novel changes to the TCP standard.</p>"
