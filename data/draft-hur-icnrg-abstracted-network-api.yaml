abstract:
- content: "<p>draft-hur-icnrg-abstracted-network-api-00.txt In information-centric
    networking (ICN), well designed API will play a pivotal role in adopting ICN to
    applications. Traditional network API – i.e., current Socket implementation -
    is coupled between applications and underlying protocols, so it is hard to change
    one without changing the other, thus it could be solved by redesigning the network
    API in a way that decouples application-specific functions from network specific
    functions. In this draft, we addressed the network API modeling issues which can
    be also applied to the design of ICN APIs and proposed iPlug and dSocket API which
    help injection of applications’ intent and hide underlying network specific mechanisms,
    respectively.</p>"
