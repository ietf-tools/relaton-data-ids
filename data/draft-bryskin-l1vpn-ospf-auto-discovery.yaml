abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an OSPF based layer-1 VPN auto-discovery mechanism.
    This mechanism enables PEs using the OSPF IGP to dynamically learn about existence
    of each other, and attributes of currently configured CE-PE links and their associations
    with L1VPNs. This document builds on [L1VPN-FRMWK] and provides an auto-discovery
    mechanism as discussed in [L1VPN-BM].</p>"
