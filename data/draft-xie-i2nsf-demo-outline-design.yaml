abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the outline design of an Interface to network
    Security Functions (I2NSF) demo, aim to enhance understanding of the I2NSF architecture
    and justify its feasibility. The I2NSF demo enables the interaction between I2NSF
    client, I2NSF controller and NSF/vNSF by using NETCONF protocol and YANG model.
    The advantage of it is to ensure that such demo outline design will be able to
    share and reuse consensually designed functions, thereby increasing interoperability.</p>"
