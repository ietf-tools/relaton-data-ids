abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a limited flooding approach to address the problem
    of routing scalability in link state IGPs. The solution is based on decomposition
    of a routing area into 'zones' and the restriction of the exchange of routing
    information between zones. This approach introduces an extra level in the isolation
    of knowledge within a routing domain. The advantage of this solution is that it
    considerably decreases the amount of information flooded in link state advertisements
    and reduces the size of the link-state database (and traffic engineering entries)
    on network elements utilizing link state protocols. The technique presented in
    this document has been particularized to OSPF in order to make the discussion
    practical and concrete. However, the underlying concepts are very general and
    similar modifications can be easily applied to other IGPs, such as ISIS.</p>"
