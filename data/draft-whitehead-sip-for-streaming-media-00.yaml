abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft reviews requirements and evaluates solutions to improve
    the integration of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] to the Real
    Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP and RTSP v2) [RFC 2326 and IDRTSP] especially in
    the context of converged media services. The document develops a rationale and
    solution space for using SIP with streaming media applications. This is done by
    first considering use cases that are used to define generic requirements to help
    compare the current and potentially new solutions. The range of solutions is sketched
    out (at high-level) and advantages and disadvantages discussed. The solutions
    evaluated address different levels of integration from SIP-only approaches to
    dual-protocol solutions.</p>"
