abstract:
- content: "<p>Ordinary TCP loss recovery takes at least one round-trip time and as
    such can increase application-perceived latency, especially for short flows such
    as Web transactions. TCP Instant Recovery (TCP-IR) is an experimental algorithm
    that allows a receiving end to recover lost packets without retransmissions, thus
    potentially saving at least one full round-trip time compared to standard TCP.
    TCP-IR achieves this by judiciously injecting encoded data segments within a TCP
    stream. This document describes the TCP-IR algorithm at the sending and receiving
    ends, along with the required protocol changes.</p>"
