abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the changes that need to be made to the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to support SIPP hosts, and describes how a
    host makes use of this protocol and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Router
    Discovery messages to form locally and globally routable address sequences automatically.
    The changes to DHCP are intended to be minimal and compatible with existing BOOTP
    and DHCP clients. Modifications include a new message format and updated operation
    definitions. Communication between a SIPP client and server is made significantly
    simpler since relay agent functionality is not required.</p>"
