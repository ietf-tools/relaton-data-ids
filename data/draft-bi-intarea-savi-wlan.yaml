abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a source address validation solution for WLANs
    where 802.11i or other security mechanisms are enabled to secure MAC addresses.
    This mechanism snoops NDP and DHCP packets to bind IP addresses to MAC addresses,
    and relies on the security of MAC addresses guaranteed by 802.11i or other mechanisms
    to filter IP spoofing packets. It can work in the special situations described
    in the charter of SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvements) workgroup, such
    as multiple MAC addresses on one interface. This document describes three different
    deployment scenarios, with solutions for migration of binding entries when hosts
    move from one access point to another.</p>"
