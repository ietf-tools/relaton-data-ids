abstract:
- content: <p>LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. However, in the present form, this mechanism
    is inadequate to verify connectivity of a segment of a Multi-Segment PseudoWire
    (MS-PW) from any node on the path of the MS-PW. Similar shortcoming is seen on
    a bidirectional co- routed MPLS TP LSPs. This document defines a TLV to address
    these shortcomings. Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].</p>
