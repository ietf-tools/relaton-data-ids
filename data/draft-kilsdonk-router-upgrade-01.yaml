abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a process which can be used to avoid network outages
    during the upgrading of a router's software. In this way, disruptions to the network
    community are avoided. The upgrade process definition comprises requirements for
    inserting a replacement router or upgrading the software in a working router within
    an operational network. To do this, it maximizes the use of accepted internet
    standards with minimal alteration.</p>"
