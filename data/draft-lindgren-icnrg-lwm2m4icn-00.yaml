abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet-of-things (IoT) supports many applications and services
    where collection and distribution of data from and to devices is central, fitting
    the named data communication model of information- centric networking (ICN) quite
    well. Many applications and use cases of the Internet of Things (IoT) imply information
    centric usage patterns. The IoT differs from many typical information centric
    application because of the dynamic nature of IoT devices and the large number
    of such devices. This creates a requirement for easy deployability in new locations
    without the need for complex setup or configuration of the devices. This draft
    provides a study of how the OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol for IoT device
    management can potentially be used for configuration and management of ICN parameters
    in an IoT network. We will address some of the tradeoffs that need to be considered
    and give an initial example of how key LWM2M functionality can be mapped to the
    ICN/IoT scenario.</p>"
