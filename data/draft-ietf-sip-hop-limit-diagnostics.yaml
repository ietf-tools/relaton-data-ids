abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) imposes a limit on the number
    of hops a request can transit on the way to its destination. When this limit is
    reached, a 483 (Too Many Hops) error response is returned. The present form of
    the 483 response does not provide enough information for the UAC or proxy on the
    path to diagnose failures whose symptom is that the hop limit is reached. This
    document specifies additional diagnostic information to be returned in a 483 response.</p>"
