abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators offer multiple services ranging from basic network
    access level service to application level service. Each of these services require
    independent authentication and authorization steps. Depending on the number of
    services and the scale of these networks, the need for multiple levels of authentication
    and authorization phases not only makes the operation complex, but it increases
    network load and session setup latency. This document summarizes the related problem
    scenarios. The goal is to address these problem scenarios with a solution based
    on the EAP keying framework.</p>"
