abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional Internet
    Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to provide access to their
    resource registration information. While most clients can retrieve the information
    they need on an ad hoc basis from the public services maintained by each registry,
    there are instances where local copies of those remote data sources need to be
    maintained, for various reasons (e.g. performance requirements). This document
    defines a protocol for transferring bulk RDAP response data and for keeping a
    local copy of that data up to date.</p>"
