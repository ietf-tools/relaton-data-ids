abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity across any combination of wired and wireless
    network segments. The RAW Architecture extends the DetNet Architecture and other
    standard IETF concepts and mechanisms to adapt to the specific challenges of the
    wireless medium. This document defines an architecture element for the RAW data
    plane, in the form of an OODA loop, that optimizes the use of constrained spectrum
    and energy while maintaining the expected connectivity properties. It also introduces
    a new Control plane Function to prepare alternate paths to go around local failures.
    The loop involves OAM, PCE, and PREOF extensions, and a new component called the
    Path Selection Engine (PSE).</p>"
