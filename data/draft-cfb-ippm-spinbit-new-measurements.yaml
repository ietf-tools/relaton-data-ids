abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces additional measurements by using the same
    spin bit signal as defined in [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin]. The spin bit signal alone
    is not enough to evaluate correctly in every network condition the RTT of a flow.
    In order to solve this problem, it is theorized the possibility of introducing
    an additional validation signal called delay bit, similar to what is done done
    by the Valid Edge Counter (VEC), but using just one bit instead of two. An alternative
    with two bits is also introduced with a so called loss bit.</p>"
