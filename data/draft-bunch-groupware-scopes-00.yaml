abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is widely used to provide clients
    with delegated access to user data. However, the core specification, The OAuth
    2.0 Authorization Framework, leaves the definition of access scopes to individual
    service providers. This has led to a fragmented ecosystem for common groupware
    services (Mail, Calendaring, Contacts), where each provider uses proprietary,
    non-interoperable scope identifiers. Client applications, such as desktop mail
    clients, are forced to hardcode configurations for a small number of large providers,
    stifling innovation and harming open ecosystems. This document proposes a standardized
    set of scope values, using the IETF-controlled URN namespace, to represent granular
    and aggregate permissions for common mail (IMAP/POP/SMTP/JMAP), calendar (CalDAV),
    and contact (CardDAV) operations. Adopting these standard scopes would significantly
    improve interoperability between clients and servers, enabling automatic client
    configuration and a more seamless user experience.</p>"
