abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a working document intended to focus discussion and refine
    draft language for the CoAP protocol specification (or other proposed standards)
    in the areas of discovery, naming, and addressing. Requirements on discovery are
    motivated. Special emphasis is placed on group definition and discovery. Examples
    show how groups can be represented in CoAP Resource Directories or DNS-SD.</p>"
