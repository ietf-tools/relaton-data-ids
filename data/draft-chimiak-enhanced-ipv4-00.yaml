abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to Internet address depletion problem
    using a clever IPv4 option mechanism as a solution, called enhanced IP (EnIP).
    Because it is IPv4, it maximizes backward compatibility while providing a six
    order of magnitude increase in address space. Unlike other similar proposals,
    care was taken to avoid costly changes and requirements to the core network and
    border routers, with the exception that options be passed in that equipment as
    described below. Because it is backward compatible, current IPv4 software, network
    equipment, firewalls, intrusion detection/ protection, and layer 5 firewalls can
    be maintained until IPv6 system information security reaches acceptable maturity
    and availability. In addition, because it is IPv4, the legally and operational
    complexities can be postponed or avoided.</p>"
