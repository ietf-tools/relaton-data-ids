abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new RTP header extension. The purpose of the
    extension is to provide additional information that further distinguishes the
    RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams containing the same type of
    payload. The information may be used to assist functions performed by application
    layer gateways (such as Session Border Controller or MCUs) and/or by routers/switches
    through deep packet inspection. Examples of these functions include intelligent
    dropping of packets or (re)setting the IP header diff-serv code points at ingress/egress
    boundaries of a diff-serv domain.</p>"
