abstract:
- content: "<p>RIP v2 as described in RFC 2453 and RIPNG as described in RFC 2080,
    do not support learning multiple equal cost routes to a destination through different
    neighbors.But in today’s internet it is very common to have topologies where there
    are more than one route to a destination. This document describes the modifications
    to the RIP/RIPNG protocols to handle this scenario and describes how to apply
    the split horizon and poison reverse for such routes. It is simple, light and
    is compatible with the implementations which do not support this feature.</p>"
