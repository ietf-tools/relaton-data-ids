abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidelines on how to structure a PPVPN Layer
    2 solution document. The intent is to provide a common way of describing the various
    functional components of a Layer 2 solution, making easier their identification
    as well as the mechanisms providing those functionalities, and, possibly, facilitating
    further convergence in the solution space. These guidelines have been discussed
    internally to the PPVPN Layer 2 design team and agreed as a recommendation, although
    not mandatory, to authors of PPVPN L2 solution drafts.</p>"
