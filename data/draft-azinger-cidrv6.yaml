abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses strategies for assigning and aggregating IPv6
    address space. While CIDR was created to help alleviate this problem in regards
    to IPv4 addresses with the original [RFC1519] (and updated in [RFC4632]) we are
    now in need of a similar document to give direction for IPv6 addressing policies.
    Similarly, [RFC1518] discussed how to use CIDR to allocate address space for IPv4,
    and [RFC1887] discusses the subject for IPv6. The objective here is to update
    these documents and provide the best current guidance on how to manage address
    space in conjunction with managing the growth of routing tables in an IPv6 world.</p>"
