abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS is the last common Internet protocol that has no encryption
    scheme and therefore provides no privacy to the users. This document proposes
    an extensible mechanism providing encryption of DNS queries and responses with
    method for secure retrieval and verification of validity of encryption keys. It
    is independent of the underlying transport protocol.</p>"
