abstract:
- content: "<p>MIME [RFC-2045, RFC-2046, RFC-2047, RFC-2184] and various other modern
    Internet protocols are capable of using many different charsets. This in turn
    means that the ability to label different charsets is essential. This registration
    procedure exists solely to associate a specific name or names with a given charset
    and to give an indication of whether or not a given charset can be used in MIME
    text objects. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
    Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
