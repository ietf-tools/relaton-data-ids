abstract:
- content: "<p>As operators struggle to optimize their network for different applications
    while maximizing network resources usage, there's growing business pressure to
    minimize operational tasks and the deployment time of new services. New automation
    paradigms are meant to help reach these goals, including the optimization of network
    functions through application control. This control could be signaled directly
    by an application, through a proxy or orchestrated in a centralized manner. The
    purpose of SUPA is to develop a methodology by which network services can be managed
    using standardized policy rules. SUPA will focus in the first phase on inter-datacenter
    traffic management as part of the distributed data center use case, including
    the automated provisioning of site-to-site virtual private networks of various
    types. This memo analyses the current state of the art of the industries in IETF
    and outside IETF.</p>"
