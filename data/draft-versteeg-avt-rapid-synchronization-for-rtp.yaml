abstract:
- content: "<p>When an RTP receiver joins a primary multicast session, it may need
    to acquire and parse certain Reference Information before it can process any data
    sent in the multicast session. Depending on the join time, length of the Reference
    Information repetition interval, size of the Reference Information as well as
    the application and transport properties, the time lag before an RTP receiver
    can usefully consume the multicast data, which we refer to as the Acquisition
    Delay, varies and may be large. This is an undesirable phenomenon for receivers
    that frequently switch among different multicast sessions, such as video broadcasts.
    In this document, we describe a method using the existing RTP and RTCP protocol
    machinery that reduces the acquisition delay. In this method, an auxiliary unicast
    RTP session carrying the Reference Information to the receiver precedes/accompanies
    the primary multicast stream. This unicast RTP flow may be transmitted at a faster
    than natural rate to further accelerate the acquisition. The motivating use case
    for this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time compressed
    audio and video. However, the proposed method can also be used in other types
    of multicast applications where the acquisition delay is long enough to be a problem.</p>"
