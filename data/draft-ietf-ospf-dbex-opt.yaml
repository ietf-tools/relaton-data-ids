abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a backward compatible optimization for the
    Database Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. In this optimization, a router
    does not list an LSA in Database Description packets sent to a neighbor, if the
    same or a more recent instance of the LSA was listed in a Database Description
    packet already received from the neighbor. This optimization reduces Database
    Description overhead by about 50% in large networks. This optimization does not
    affect synchronization, since it only omits unnecessary information from Database
    Description packets.</p>"
