abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes use-cases for IRS to provide a lightweight
    method for common management and control state for typical operations and workflows
    of multilayer networks involving both IP and sub-IP transport. IRS provides a
    lightweight, streaming interface between routing systems and external applications.
    By extending the IRS model to transport systems, multi-layer networks can be managed
    and used more efficiently. IRS may enable the integration of IP and transport
    maintenance workflows leading to a reduction in operational costs. IRS server
    having visibility into both Optical Transport and IP domains will also be able
    to make optimal use of transport infrastructure.</p>"
