abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT64 is a mechanism for translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and
    vice-versa. DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records.
    These two mechanisms together enable client-server communication between an IPv6-only
    client and an IPv4-only server, without requiring any changes to either the IPv6
    or the IPv4 node, for the class of applications that work through NATs. They also
    enable peer-to-peer communication between an IPv4 and an IPv6 node, where the
    communication can be initiated by either end using existing, NAT-traversing, peer-to-peer
    communication techniques. This document specifies NAT64, and gives suggestions
    on how they should be deployed.</p>"
