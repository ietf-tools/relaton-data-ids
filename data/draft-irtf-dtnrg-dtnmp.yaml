abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network Management
    Protocol (DTNMP). The DTNMP provides monitoring and configuration services between
    managing devices and managed devices, some of which may operate on the far side
    of high-delay or high-disruption links. The protocol is designed to minimize the
    number of transmitted bytes, to operate without sessions or (concurrent) two-way
    links, and to function autonomously when there is no timely contact with a network
    operator.</p>"
