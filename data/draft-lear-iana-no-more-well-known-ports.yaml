abstract:
- content: <p>Amongst other things the IANA manages port assignments for TCP, UDP,
    and SCTP protocols. This document specifies the procedure by which those assignments
    take place. The distinction between so-called "well known ports" and other public
    static assignments is deprecated, the use of SRV records is encouraged, and documentation
    of port use is strongly encouraged.</p>
