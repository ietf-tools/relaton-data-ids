abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a way that one or more centralized controllers
    can use BGP to set up multicast distribution trees (identified by either IP source/destination
    address pair, mLDP FEC, or SR-P2MP Tree-ID) in a network. Since the controllers
    calculate the trees, they can use sophisticated algorithms and constraints to
    achieve traffic engineering. The controllers directly signal dynamic replication
    state to tree nodes, leading to very simple multicast control plane on the tree
    nodes, as if they were using static routes. This can be used for both underlay
    and overlay multicast trees, including replacing BGP-MVPN signaling.</p>"
