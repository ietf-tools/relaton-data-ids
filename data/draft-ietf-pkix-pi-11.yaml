abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new form of name, called permanent identifier,
    that may be included in the subjectAltName extension of a public key certificate
    issued to an entity. The permanent identifier is an optional feature that may
    be used by a CA to indicate that two or more certificates relate to the same entity,
    even if they contain different subject name (DNs) or different names in the subjectAltName
    extension, or if the name or the affiliation of that entity stored in the subject
    or another name form in the subjectAltName extension has changed. The subject
    name, carried in the subject field, is only unique for each subject entity certified
    by the one CA as defined by the issuer name field. However, the new name form
    can carry a name that is unique for each subject entity certified by a CA. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
