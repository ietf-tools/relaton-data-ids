abstract:
- content: "<p>There has recently been a lot of activity in defining the components
    for MPLS-based traffic engineering. This includes the recent extensions of the
    Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) to carry metrics and resource class information
    about links. This memo explores additional metrics that are useful for traffic
    engineering. We also describe some of the subtleties associated with the use of
    the resource class (or color) vector that has been defined in the IGP extensions.</p>"
