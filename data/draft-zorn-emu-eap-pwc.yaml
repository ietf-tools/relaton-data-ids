abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. One such method is Generic Token Card (EAP-GTC) which,
    despite its name, is commonly used to support authentication using cleartext passwords
    in tunneled EAP methods. EAP-GTC does not provide the ability to change a password
    (for example, an expired password), however. This document defines the PassWord
    Change EAP method (EAP-PWC) in order to fill that void in functionality.</p>"
