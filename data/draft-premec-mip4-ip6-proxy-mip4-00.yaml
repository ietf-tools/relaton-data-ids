abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6-based end-user device is commonly not able to utilize the
    advantages introduced by the mobile IP protocols. However, this specification
    describes how an end-user device supporting only IPv6 protocol stack may be provided
    with a mobility service by the mobile IPv4-based access network. The unaltered
    end-user device relies on the functionalities of the two network-side entities,
    the Home Agent and the new Proxy Mobile Node, acting on its behalf and providing
    the IP layer mobility management.</p>"
