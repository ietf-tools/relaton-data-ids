abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for the setup,reoptimization and
    recovery of PTP LSP based on the PDV metrics between the 1588 Master and the 1588
    Slave. When a PTP communication path goes through the third party networks (e.g.
    the MPLS networks), the PDV noise caused by the third party networks will have
    a significant impact on the synchronization performance. So, the PDV metrics should
    be considered in the setup of PTP LSP. In addition, when the PDV noise exceeds
    to a certain degree, it is necessary to notify the head-end LSR(i.e. the 1588
    Master) to switch to the backup PTP LSP and to reoptimize the primary PTP LSP
    in order to improve the PTP reliability.</p>"
