abstract:
- content: "<p>In various applications of MPLS, label stacks with multiple entries
    are used. In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label of the stack
    with an IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling the application to run over networks
    which do not have MPLS enabled in their core routers. This draft specifies two
    IP-based encapsulations, MPLS-in-IP, and MPLS-in-GRE. Each of these is applicable
    in some circumstances.</p>"
