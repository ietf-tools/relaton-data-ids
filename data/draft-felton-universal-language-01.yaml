abstract:
- content: "<p>The existence of language and culture, creates an enormous blockage
    for the World Wide Web. While we communicate well internationally using pictures,
    we have limited communications when we attempt to build semantic bridges. In general,
    our approach to this has been to try to force the other guy to learn our language.</p>"
