abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the RTP payload format of the Secure Communication
    Interoperability Protocol (SCIP). SCIP is an application layer protocol that provides
    end-to-end capability exchange, packetization/de-packetization of media, reliable
    transport, and security services such as confidentiality and integrity protection.
    SCIP handles packetization/de-packetization of the encrypted media and acts as
    a tunneling protocol, treating SCIP payloads as opaque octets to be encapsulated
    within RTP payloads prior to transmission or decapsulated on reception. SCIP payloads
    are sized to fit within the maximum transmission unit (MTU) when transported over
    RTP thereby avoiding fragmentation. SCIP provides confidentiality and integrity
    of the tunneled media, therefore the SCIP payload does not require the use of
    Secure RTP (SRTP) for payload protection. SCIP also provides for reliable transport
    at the application layer, so it is not necessary to negotiate RTCP retransmission
    capabilities. To establish reliable communications using SCIP over RTP, it is
    important that middle boxes avoid parsing or modifying SCIP payloads. Because
    SCIP payloads are confidentiality and integrity protected and are only decipherable
    by the originating and receiving SCIP devices, modification of the payload by
    middle boxes would be detected as an integrity failure in SCIP devices, resulting
    in retransmission and/or communication failure. Middle boxes do not need to parse
    the SCIP payloads to correctly transport them. Not only is parsing unnecessary
    to tunnel/detunnel SCIP within RTP, but the parsing and filtering of SCIP payloads
    by middle boxes would likely lead to ossification of the evolving SCIP protocol.</p>"
