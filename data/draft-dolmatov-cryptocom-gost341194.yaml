abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to be a source of information about the Russian
    Federal standard hash function (GOST R 34.11-94), which is one of the Russian
    cryptographic standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms). Recently, Russian
    cryptography is being used in Internet applications, and this document has been
    created as information for developers and users of GOST R 34.11-94 for hash computation.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
