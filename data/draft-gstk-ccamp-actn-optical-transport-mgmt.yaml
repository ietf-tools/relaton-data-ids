abstract:
- content: "<p>Many network technologies are operated as Traffic Engineered (TE) networks.
    Optical networks are a particular, with many technology- specific details. Abstraction
    and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) is a management architecture that abstracts
    TE network resources to provide a limited network view for customers to request
    and self-manage connectivity services. It also provides functional components
    to orchestrate and operate the network. Management of legacy optical networks
    is often provided via Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security
    (known as FCAPS) using mechanisms such as the Multi-Technology Operations System
    Interface (MTOSI) and the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). FCAPS
    can form a critical part of configuration management and service assurance for
    network operations. However, ACTN does not include consideration of FCAPS. This
    document enhances the ACTN architecture as applied to optical networks by introducing
    support for FCAPS. It considers which elements of existing IETF YANG work can
    be used to solve existing scenarios and emerging technologies, and what new work
    may be needed. This enhanced architecture may then be used to evolve networks
    from CORBA and MTOSI FCAPS interfaces to IETF-based YANG and RESTful API capabilities.</p>"
