abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP is a lower layer dependant protocol that has 802.1X and PANA to
    carry it over link layer and network layer respectively. 802.1X cannot go through
    any nodes, while PANA can carry EAP through the network over network layer. 802.1X
    is popular on legacy terminals, but it is painful to upgrade all these terminals
    to support PANA. This document introduces a PANA interworking function that enables
    legacy 802.1X terminals get authentication and access to PANA network without
    upgrading its software or hardware.</p>"
