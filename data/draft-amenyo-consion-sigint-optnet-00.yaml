abstract:
- content: "<p>When one extrapolates from the ongoing evolutionary trends of IP router
    / switch development and its role in the build-out of optical core, edge, access
    and enterprise networks, it is reasonable to reach the almost inescapable conclusion
    that within a few years, there will be a complete physical separation of the commercial
    equipment embodying various concerns, aspects, roles and functions of data communications,
    Namely, 1. Separate equipment for transport (transmission, switching and multiplexing)
    and traffic forwarding. 2. Separate equipment concerned with control, signaling,
    traffic engineering, provisioning, protection and restoration control, as well
    as, traffic and flow management, (generalized 'softswitches'). 3. Separate equipment
    for network management, operations support, measurement &amp; metering, OAMP,
    inter-OSS, engineering management (including performance management, availability
    management, security management, accounting management), as well as life cycle
    support.</p>"
