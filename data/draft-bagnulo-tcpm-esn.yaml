abstract:
- content: "<p>This note defines the Extended Sequence Number (ESN) experimental modification
    to TCP to increase TCP's sequence number using the TimeStamp (TS) option. It also
    modifies the Window Scale (WS) option to support larger receiver window enable
    by the extended sequence number space. At this stage, the purpose of this document
    is to discuss different design choices to generate discussion about the approach
    to follow.</p>"
