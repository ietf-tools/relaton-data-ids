abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new packet format motivated with the goal of
    having a single protocol for constrained IoT and unconstrained infrastructure
    segments of an ICN network. The packet format focuses on reducing the transport
    overhead compared to the one proposed in [1]. The resulting savings in terms of
    energy and computing is significant for low power radios with restricted payload
    size.</p>"
