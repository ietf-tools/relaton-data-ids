abstract:
- content: "<p>This document scopes the relation between Internet protocols and the
    right to freedom of assembly and association. Increasingly, the Internet mediates
    our lives, our relationships and our ability to exercise our human rights. As
    a forum, the Internet provides a global public space even though it is built predominantly
    on private infrastructure. Since Internet protocols play a central role in the
    management, development and use of the Internet, the relation between protocols
    and the aforementioned rights should be documented and any adverse impacts of
    this relation should be mitigated.</p>"
