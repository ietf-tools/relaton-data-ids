abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a specific EID scheme namely "cla" that meets
    the requirement for endpoint identification as defined in the Bundle Protocol
    and that also uniquely identifies a Convergence Layer Adapter "channel" and is,
    in essence, an interface identifier (IID). Such IID is comprised of two parts:
    a "cla-identifier" part that identifies a specific convergence layer adapter,
    and a "cla- parameters" part that is a cla-specific list of parameter describing
    a single channel managed by this convergence layer adapter.</p>'
