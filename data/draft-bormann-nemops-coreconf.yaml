abstract:
- content: "<p>This short paper provides an overview over the CORECONF architecture
    for employing YANG models in managing IoT devices. CORECONF is based on CoAP as
    a transfer protocol and YANG-CBOR as its data representation format, analogous
    to the way the original RESTCONF was defined to use HTTP and YANG-XML or YANG-JSON,
    and the way NETCONF uses SSH and YANG-XML.</p>"
