abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo contains an algorithmic description of the rules used by
    an RSVP implementation for processing messages. It is intended to clarify the
    version 1 RSVP protocol specification [RFC 2205]. These rules are decomposed into
    pieces which are contained inside of an abstract processing architecture. This
    document provides an updated version of the previous processing rules [RFC 2209].
    It attempts to provide a description that is less dependent on the particular
    design choices made in the ISI reference implementation of RSVP.</p>"
