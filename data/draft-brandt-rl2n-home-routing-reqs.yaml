abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the home control and automation application
    specific requirements for Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks (RL2N). In a
    modern home, a high number of wireless devices are used for a wide set of purposes.
    Examples include lighting control modules, heating control panels, light sensors,
    temperature sensors, gas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance,
    healthcare systems and advanced remote controls. Because such devices only cover
    a limited radio range, multi-hop routing is often required. Such devices are usually
    highly constrained in terms of resources such as battery and memory and operate
    in unstable environments. The aim of this document is to specify the routing requirements
    for networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network environment.</p>"
