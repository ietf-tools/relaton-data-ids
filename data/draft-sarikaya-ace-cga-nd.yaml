abstract:
- content: "<p>Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are proposed in
    order to secure the neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks. This
    document defines lightweight and secure version of the neighbor discovery for
    low-power and lossy networks. The nodes generate a Cryptographically Generated
    Address, register the Cryptographically Generated Address with a default router
    and periodically refresh the registration. Cryptographically generated address
    and digital signatures are calculated using elliptic curve cryptography, so that
    the cryptographic operations are suitable for low power devices.</p>"
