abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. The requesting
    router then acts as a router between the downstream- attached hosts and the upstream
    Internetwork, and can also act as a host under the weak end system model. This
    document considers the case when the "requesting router" is actually a simple
    host which receives a delegated prefix that it can use solely for its own internal
    multi-addressing purposes under the strong end system model. This method can be
    applied in a wide variety of use cases to allow ample address availability without
    impacting link performance.</p>
