abstract:
- content: <p>We define a new RTSP command - named "REGISTER" - that allows a server
    (or a third party) to notify a RTSP client or a RTSP proxy server about a RTSP
    stream (given by a "rtsp://" URL). This also provides a mechanism whereby a client
    (or proxy server) on the public Internet can access a RTSP server that is behind
    a firewall or NAT.</p>
