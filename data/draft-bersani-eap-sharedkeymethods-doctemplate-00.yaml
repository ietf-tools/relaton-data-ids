abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a template for authors of EAP methods that rely
    on shared keys, to document their work. Since EAP methods have proliferated but
    only 4 are currently standardized and since no simple shared key EAP method seems
    to be widely available to replace EAP-MD5 that has been deprecated for security
    reasons, this template is the first step towards standardizing such an EAP method.
    This document is indeed intended to help gather information on the existing related
    work before requesting that a new work item be opened at IETF to standardize a
    replacement for EAP-MD5.</p>"
