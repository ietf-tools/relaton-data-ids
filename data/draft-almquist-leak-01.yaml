abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses how routers can 'leak' routing information learned
    from one routing domain into another routing domain. Although this memo is not
    an official product of the Router Requirements working group, it is being published
    as an Internet Draft because it is required reading for those who wish to actively
    participate in the Router Requirements sessions during the IETF meeting in Atlanta.</p>"
