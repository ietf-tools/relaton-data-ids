abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mesh Callsign Registry is a name registry that provides a mapping
    from human-friendly callsigns to root of trusts and a service assigned by the
    callsign holder to service the account bound to that callsign. An append only
    sequence authenticated by means of a Merkle Tree and periodic third party notarizations
    provides ground truth for the integrity of the registry and for all the assertions
    enrolled in the sequence. https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/mathmesh/ (http://whatever)Discussion
    of this draft should take place on the MathMesh mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org),
    which is archived at .</p>"
