abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bordercast Resolution Protocol (BRP) provides the bordercasting
    packet delivery service used to support network querying applications. The BRP
    uses a map of an extended routing zone, provided by the local proactive Intrazone
    Routing Protocol (IARP), to construct bordercast (multicast) trees, along which
    query packets are directed. Within the context of the hybrid ZRP, the BRP is used
    to guide the route requests of the global reactive Interzone Routing Protocol
    (IERP). The BRP employs special query control mechanisms to steer route requests
    away from areas of the network that have already been covered by the query. The
    combination of multicasting and zone based query control makes bordercasting an
    efficient and tunable service that is more suitable than flood searching for network
    probing applications like route discovery.</p>"
