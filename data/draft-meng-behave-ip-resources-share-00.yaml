abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a solution to enable IP addresses sharing among
    multiple CGN devices, including requesting and releasing IP addresses. Through
    this solution, the operators can make the dynamic sharing of IP addresses, improve
    the IP address sharing rate, realize resources'optimization, provide a more convenient
    platform for operators to manage of IP address pools. In addition, due to the
    unified management of IP addresses from the AAA server, CGN device MAY reboot
    without provisioned IP address pools.</p>"
