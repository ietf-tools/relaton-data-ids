abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can help save network
    resource and is useful in scenarios such as LSP recovery or when two LSPs do not
    need to be active at the same time. A Path Computation Element (PCE) is responsible
    for path computation with such requirement. Given this feature and its access
    to the network resource information and possibly active LSPs information, it can
    be used to support resource-sharing-based path computation with better efficiency.
    This document extends the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to
    support resource sharing-based path computation.</p>"
