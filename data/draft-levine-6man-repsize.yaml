abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications such as e-mail track the reputation of the hosts that
    connect to them by IP address. Since the IPv6 address space is so large, a reputation
    system needs to aggregate the data for the IPs useded by a single entity. This
    document describes a file format a network operator can use to describe the sizes
    of the IP prefixes it allocates, for reputation systems to use to determine the
    aggregation boundaries. It also specifies an addition to the the Routing Policy
    Specification Language (RPSL) inetnum: class to refer to the location of the boundary
    file, and a method to sign boundary files.</p>"
