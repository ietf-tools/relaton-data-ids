abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes resource pooling mechanism for multi-layer operations.
    Resource pool is often discussed in the context of robustness and restoration.
    But, resource pooling mechanism should also be used for realizing flexibility
    in multi-layer network operations. Today, it takes days or weeks of lead time
    to change wide area networks composed of multiple network layers. One of the reasons
    is because communications between operators of different network layers are necessary
    before configuration of each layer is made. A network management system that uses
    resource pooling mechanism would get rid of communications made between operators
    of different network layers, and would realize flexible changes in multi-layer
    networks.</p>"
