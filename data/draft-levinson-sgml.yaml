abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how a document written using the Standardized
    General Markup Language (SGML) is to be carried within a MIME message. MIME provides
    a flexible mechanism for structuring RFC 822 message bodies. Additional mechanisms
    are required to encapsulate SGML documents which can consist of multiple parts.
    The mechanisms specify how to label the SGML parts and how to represent the internal
    references between the files. In addition, this document specifies the requirements
    for conformance to the SGML Document Interchange Format (SDIF). Subtypes are proposed
    for the Multipart and Application content types to support SGML documents and
    their interchange format within MIME. SGML is one of a class of compound documents
    which consist of a number of a set of parts or files, some of which may contain
    references to other files in the set. Explicit indications of the bindings between
    the sender's file names and the MIME body parts are needed to re-bind the sender's
    file names to ones on the recipient's system. Further, the document may refer
    to host system commands, a security hazard which must be controlled.</p>"
