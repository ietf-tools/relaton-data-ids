abstract:
- content: '<p>This document presents an architecture for a distributed DNSSEC multi-signer
    model that most closely resembles "model 2" in [RFC8901]. It defines two multi-signer
    specific entities: the "multi-signer agent" (MSA) that is responsible for the
    multi-signer process and the "combiner", which is responsible for "combining"
    unsigned zone data from the zone owner with zone data under control of the MSA.
    It introduces a new DNS RRtype, HSYNC, that is used by the zone owner to designate
    the chosen DNS Providers (signing and/or serving the zone). Furthermore it describes
    a mechanism for the MSAs to establish secure communication with each other, either
    via “pure DNS” communication secured by DNS SIG(0) signatures on each message
    or via a RESTful API secured by TLS. Finally, the document describes two models
    for multi-signer process synchronization: “leader/follower mode” and “peer mode”
    and the mechanism by which a set of MSAs decide which model to use for a given
    zone. The scope of the document is only the distributed aspect of DNSSEC multi-signer
    up to the point where secure communication and synchronization method between
    MSAs has been established. The “multi-signer algorithms” that deal with the actual
    synchronization required for multi-signer operation are described in [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-automation].
