abstract:
- content: "<p>A key establishment protocol intended to run between constrained devices
    has to be both lightweight and secure. Among the existing key establishment families
    (key agreement, key transport, server- assisted key transport or key distribution),
    the latter is the best candidate for constrained devices, since it can keep cryptographic
    operations simple at nodes sides. Nevertheless, most key distribution protocols
    exhibit an asymmetric design, since they are supposed to run between devices playing
    well-defined client and server roles, implying different security assumptions
    between the devices involved in the exchange. MIKEY-Ticket is a key distribution
    protocol that specifies new modes for the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol.
    It answers situations where the network contains a trusted third party (one or
    multiple trusted key management servers). The general MIKEY-Ticket mode is a key
    distribution scheme relying on six messages exchanged between the node initiating
    the protocol (Initiator), the Key Management Server (KMS) and the responding node
    (Responder). This general mode assumes that the two parties establishing a key
    with each other play similar roles, with the only exception that one is the Initiator
    and the other one the Responder. However, this mode suffers from a risk of a Denial
    of Service (DoS) inherited from the protocol design. In addition, the protocol
    syntax involves very large messages that would have to be fragmented, and would
    therefore not be convenient to communications between constrained nodes. In this
    document, we propose a new MIKEY-Ticket mode that solves the risk of DoS during
    the key establishment between the Initiator and the Responder, relies on a 5-message
    exchange instead of a 6-message one and bases on a simplified syntax, leading
    to lighter messages.</p>"
