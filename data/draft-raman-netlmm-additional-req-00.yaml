abstract:
- content: "<p>In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-req-01.txt, a set of requirements for
    a protocol for localized mobility management has been described. In this draft,
    we propose to include an additional requirement that components of existing IETF
    protocols should be reused wherever possible to avoid extensive standardization
    activity and to enable reuse of existing IETF-compliant protocol implementations.</p>"
