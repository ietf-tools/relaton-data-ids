abstract:
- content: "<p>Confidential computing is the protection of data in use by performing
    computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment. Confidential computing
    could provide integrity and confidentiality for users who want to run application
    and process data in that environment. When confidential computing is used in network
    like MEC and CAN which provide computing resource to network users, TEEP protocol
    could be used to provision network user's data and application in TEE environment
    in confidential computing resource. This document focuses on using TEEP to provision
    network user's data and application in confidential computing in such network.
    This document is a use case and extension of TEEP and could provide guidance for
    MEC, CAN and other scenarios to use confidential computing.</p>"
