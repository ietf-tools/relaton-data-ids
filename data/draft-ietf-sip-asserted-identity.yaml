abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes private extensions to SIP that enable a network
    of trusted SIP servers to assert the identity of authenticated users, and the
    application of existing privacy mechanisms to the identity problem. The use of
    these extensions is only applicable inside an administrative domain with previously
    agreed-upon policies for generation, transport and usage of such information.
    This document does NOT offer a general privacy or identity model suitable for
    use between different trust domains, or use in the Internet at large.</p>"
