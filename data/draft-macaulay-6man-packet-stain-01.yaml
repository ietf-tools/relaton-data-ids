abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the application of security staining on an
    IPv6 datagrams and the minimum requirements for IPv6 nodes staining flows, IPv6
    nodes forwarding stained packets within a given domain of control, and nodes interpreting
    stains on flows. The usage of the packet staining destination option enables proactive
    delivery of security intelligence to IPv6 nodes such as firewalls and intrusion
    prevention systems, and end-points such servers, workstations, mobile and smart
    devices and an infinite array of as- yet-to-be-invented sensors and controllers.
    The usage of packet staining is not intended for use across the open internet,
    where fragmentation issues associated with increased header size may induce service
    degradation; packet staining is intended as a security adjunct within a given
    doamin of control such as an carrier or enterprise network.</p>"
