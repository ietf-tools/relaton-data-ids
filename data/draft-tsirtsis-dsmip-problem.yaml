abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the issues associated with mobility management
    for dual stack mobile nodes. Currently, two mobility management protocols are
    defined for IPv4 and IPv6. Deploying both in a dual stack mobile node introduces
    a number of inefficiencies. Deployment and operational issues motivate the use
    of a single mobility management protocol. This draft discusses such motivations.
    The draft also hints on how current MIPv4 and MIPv6 could be extended so that
    they can support mobility management for a dual stack node.</p>"
