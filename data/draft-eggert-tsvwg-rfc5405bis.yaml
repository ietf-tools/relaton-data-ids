abstract:
- content: "<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing
    transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. Because congestion
    control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and
    other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms
    to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent
    traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how
    they use UDP. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers
    of applications, tunnels and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control
    guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other
    topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, and middlebox traversal.
    If published as an RFC, this document will obsolete RFC5405.</p>"
