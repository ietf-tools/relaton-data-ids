abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media handling
    in multi-party calls. The main discussed transport is to carry Real-Time text
    by the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103. The mechanisms
    enable the receiving application to present the received real-time text media,
    separated per source, in different ways according to user preferences. Some presentation
    related features are also described explaining suitable variations of transmission
    and presentation of text. Call control features are described for the SIP environment.
    A number of alternative methods for providing the multi-party negotiation, transmission
    and presentation are discussed and a recommendation for the main ones is provided.
    The main solution for SIP based centralized multi-party handling of real-time
    text is achieved through a media control unit coordinating multiple RTP text streams
    into one RTP stream. Alternative methods using a single RTP stream and source
    identification inline in the text stream are also described, one of them being
    provided as a lower functionality fallback method for endpoints with no multi-party
    awareness for RTT. Bridging methods where the text stream is carried without the
    contents being dealt with in detail by the bridge are also discussed. Brief information
    is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC environment. The intention
    is to provide background for decisions, specification and implementation of selected
    methods. The recommendations have resulted in the published RFC 9071. This document
    is maintained mainly to present the reasoning behind the recommendations and provide
    material for any further work in other application areas.</p>"
