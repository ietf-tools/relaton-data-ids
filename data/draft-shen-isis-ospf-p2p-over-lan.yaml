abstract:
- content: "<p>Two different circuit types are commonly used by link state routing
    protocols: point-to-point and broadcast. It is important to identify the correct
    circuit type in forming adjacency with neighbors, in flooding link state database
    packets, in representation of the circuit subnet. This document describes a simple
    mechanism to treat the broadcast media as point-to-point connection from IP routing
    protocol point of view if there are only two devices on the LAN media.</p>"
