abstract:
- content: "<p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/. When MPLS
    labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an MPLS VPN,
    the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more
    than 30 bytes. VoIP header compression can significantly reduce the VoIP overhead
    through various compression mechanisms. This is important on access links where
    bandwidth is scarce, and can be important on backbone facilities, especially where
    costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections). Providing VoIP header compression
    over multiple hop paths avoids multiple compression/decompression cycles at each
    router, and thereby increases the processing scalability of the maximum number
    of simultaneous VoIP flows which use header compression at each router. This draft
    gives a problem statement, example scenarios, goals, and requirements for VoIP
    header compression from compressor to decompressor over multiple-hop paths, possibly
    over MPLS. It also discusses work items and issues for consideration, and highlights
    various solution alternatives that have been proposed.</p>"
