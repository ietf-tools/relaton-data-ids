abstract:
- content: '<p>[RFC5213] prompts the Inner-domain handover of the MN in Proxy Mobile
    IPv6(PMIPv6).This document describes network-based Inter-domain handover functionality
    and corresponding mobility options for PMIPv6.This document strictly abides by
    the three principle describes in PMIPv6: (a)The movement of MN is transparent
    to CN. (b)MN doesn''t participate in any mobility-related signaling.LMA and MAG
    are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host. (c)This document
    is compatible with RFC5213. The points of this document are as follows: (1) Concepts:
    The MN''s Home Agent(HA) ,Home Address (HoA) and Care-of address(CoA) is not only
    for user but also for the specific session.MN initiating a session uses the address
    assigned by the LMA which the MN is registered at the moment as the HoA for the
    session.The user initiating a session uses the address assigned by the LMA which
    the MN moves to as the CoA for the session. (2) Binding Cache:Every local mobility
    anchor must maintain two Binding Cache entries for each currently registered mobile
    node. One is Inner-domain BCE,the other is Inter-domain BCE. Inner-domain BCE
    maintains the binding between MN''s Proxy-CoA and MN''s HoA. Inter- domain BCE
    maintains the bingding between CN''s HoA and CN''s CoA. (3)Communication:For the
    user initiating a session or accepting a session,no matter how it moves,the HoA
    for the session is unchanged,the source address of the data packets is the user''s
    own HoA,and the destination address of the the data packets is the HoA of CN.The
    local mobility anchor will check all the packets received from the mobile access
    gateway.If both the source address of the data packets is the MN''s HoA recorded
    in Inner-domain BCE,and the CN''s HoA and CoA recorded in Inter-domain BCE are
    the same,the LMA will route the packets directly to CN as described in RFC5213.Otherwise,
    according to looking up the Inter-domain BCE,LMA gets the CoA of CN. Then ,LMA
    encapsulates the packets to route to CN.On receiving a packet from a correspondent
    node with the destination address matching a mobile node''s home network prefix(es),
    the CN''s LMA MUST first check the source address and the destination address
    of the data packets,if the source address of the data packets is MN''s HoA recorded
    in Inter-domain BCE and the destination address is CN''s HoA recorded in Inner-domain
    BCE ,the CN''LMA will forward the packets to the right MAG directly as described
    in RFC5213.Otherwise, CN''LMA will remove the outer header before forwarding the
    packet. Then,LMA looks up the Inner-domain BCE to forward the packets to the right
    MAG. (4)Updates:When MN moves to visited LMA(MN-vLMA),MN-vLMA will do three things.
    Firstly MN-vLMA will assign a MN-CoA for MN and build up the Inner- domain BCE
    for MN. Secondly,MN-vLMA will sends message to MN-hLMA to get the HoA of CN .Then,MN-vLMA
    builds up the binding between CN-HoA and CN-HoA in the Inter-domain BCE.Thirdly,
    MN-vLMA sends message to CN-LMA wiht the MN-CoA and MN-HoA included in the message
    to help CN- LMA updating the Inter-domain BCE for MN. Compared with "draft-ma-netext-pmip-handover-00.txt",
    this document is compatible with RFC5213 and the LMA described in this document
    should decide if it is necessary to encapsulate the packets.In other word,if MN
    and CN are both in their home domain,they will communicate just as the way described
    in RFC5213 and otherwise they will communicate in the way described in this document.</p>'
