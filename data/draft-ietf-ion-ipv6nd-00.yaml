abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to describe and summarize some current proposals
    for running IPv6 over ATM, and identifies open issues that require resolution
    by one or more IETF working groups. The frame formats for unicast and multicast
    transmission of IPv6 packets in a UNI3.1 based ATM environment are specified.
    Some issues regarding the construction of IPv6 link-local addresses are identified,
    and a proposal made. A format for source and target link-layer address options
    in Neighbor Discovery messages is suggested, and the interactions between IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery and existing IP over ATM models are outlined. This revision
    looks at the three models that were presented at the Los Angeles IETF in March
    1996, in a joint session of the IPATM, IPNG, and ROLC working groups. No firm
    decisions were made at this joint meeting. Readers are encouraged to locate and
    review the Internet Drafts describing each model in greater detail. Further discussion
    of the issues raised in this document is requested, as not all questions are currently
    answered satisfactorily.</p>"
