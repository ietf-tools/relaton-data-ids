abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new control bit in the IPv6 RA PIO flags octet
    that indicates that the node receiving this RA is the exclusive receiver of all
    traffic destined to any address within that prefix. Termed the eXclusive flag
    (or "X flag"), nodes that recognize this can perform some optimizations to save
    time and traffic (e.g. disable ND and DAD for addresses within this prefix) and
    more immediately pursue the benefits of being provided multiple addresses (vis.
    [RFC7934] section 3). Additionally, network infrastructure nodes (routers, switches)
    can benefit by minimizing the number of {link layer, IP} address pairs required
    to offer network connectivity (vis. [RFC7934] section 9.3). Use of the X flag
    is backward compatible with existing IPv6 standards compliant implementations.</p>
