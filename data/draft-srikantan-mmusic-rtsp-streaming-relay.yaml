abstract:
- content: "<p>Delivery of streaming media to a large number of clients distributed
    across several geographic and network boundaries presents several challenges in
    terms of scalability and stream quality. This document describes N-tier relays
    to address scalability and quality issues in the delivery of stored and live content.
    This document addresses issues in stream synchronization, content announcement/expiry,
    reliability of transport, failover/recovery, administration, and security issues.
    This document propose a set of primitives to enable implementation of Push and
    Pull mechanisms for N-tier relays. We also provide usage scenarios where each
    approach is most useful. The Pull and Push mechanisms are complementary and provide
    valuable building blocks in N-tier relays. This document introduces a few new
    RTSP methods and headers.</p>"
