abstract:
- content: "<p>This document, while sharing a similar concept, is an overhaul of TRACE-00
    and describes a strategy for domain name server operators to prepare and transition
    their services for multilingual domain names (IDN â€“ Internationalized Domain Names).
    The TRACE-01 or IDNX (IDN Transition) approach accepts that users with non-IDN
    aware applications will be attempting to access multilingual domain names. Hence
    it is the registry or domain operator's responsibility to provide an IDN solution
    that resolves these issues to make it a seamless transition experience for technically
    unsophisticated users. In essence, the IDNX approach embraces a complementary
    server-side implementation to smooth the transition. IDNX ready domain servers
    should be backward compatible, and successfully resolve IDN requests sent via
    non-IDN aware applications, whether they are formatted in local encoding, UTF-8
    or an identifiable variant; as well as forward compatible, and be able to resolve
    ACE requests.</p>"
