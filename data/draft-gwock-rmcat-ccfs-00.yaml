abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes CCFS(Congestion Control based on Forward path
    Status), rate adaptation scheme for interactive real-time media applications,
    such as video conferencing. CCFS manages forward path's status based on the estimated
    three major parameters - serving bitrate, queue delay and queue delay by cross
    traffics. Considering only forward path status minimizes the effects of backward
    path's network event such as congestion. It also is free from compatibility issues
    because it defines generalized feedback message and minimizes receiver's role.</p>"
