abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF (OSPFv2 and OSPFv3) is widely deployed link-state protocol in
    routing networks. During the past decades, it has been operated and maintained
    through typical CLI, SNMP and NETCONF. With the expansion and complication of
    modern networks, the necessity for rapid and dynamic control has been increased.
    The I2RS is a standard-based interface which provides a programmatic way to achieve
    this goal. This document specifies an OSPF yang data model for the I2RS interface
    to OSPF. This model is based on the the I2RS OSPF informational model (draft-ietf-wu-ospf-info-model-00)
    which satisfies the requirements suggested by the I2RS use case requirements for
    the IGPs. This yang data model can be used by I2RS client-agent protocol to program
    OSPF routing entities.</p>"
