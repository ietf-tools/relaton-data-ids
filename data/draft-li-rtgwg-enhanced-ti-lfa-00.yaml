abstract:
- content: "<p>Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate Fast Re-route (TI-LFA) aims
    at providing protection of node and adjacency segments within the Segment Routing
    (SR) framework. A key aspect of TI-LFA is the FRR path selection approach establishing
    protection over the expected post-convergence paths from the point of local repair.
    However, the TI-LFA FRR path may skip the node even if it is specified in the
    SID list to be traveled. This document defines Enhanced TI-LFA(TI-LFA+) by adding
    a No-bypass indicator for segments to ensure that the FRR route will not bypass
    the specific node, such as firewall.</p>"
