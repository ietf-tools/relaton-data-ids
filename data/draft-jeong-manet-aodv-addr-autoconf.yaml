abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the steps a node running AODV in ad hoc network
    takes in deciding how to autoconfigure its IPv4 or IPv6 address in network interface.
    Because the ad hoc IP address autoconfiguration in this document considers ad
    hoc network's partition and mergence, the address duplication caused by ad hoc
    network's mergence can be resolved through address resolution protocol. Also,
    this document specifies how to resolve the address duplication in order to guarantee
    the maintenance of upper-layer sessions, such as TCP session.</p>"
