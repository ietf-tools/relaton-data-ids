abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread deployment.
    However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable
    as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes.
    One potential technique to mitigate this is to use a Negative Trust Anchor, which
    is defined in this document.</p>"
