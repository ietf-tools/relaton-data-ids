abstract:
- content: "<p>Current network benchmarking methodologies are focused on physical
    networking components and do not consider the actual application layer traffic
    patterns and hence do not reflect the traffic that virtual networking components
    work with. The purpose of this document is to distinguish and highlight benchmarking
    considerations when testing and evaluating virtual networking components in the
    data center.</p>"
