abstract:
- content: "<p>With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the distances
    between the user and the applications are growing. A lot of the current applications
    are designed to work across LAN's and have various inherent assumptions. For multiple
    applications such as High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial markets,
    the response times are critical as is packet loss, while other applications require
    more throughput. [RFC3031] describes the architecture of MPLS based networks.
    This draft extends the MPLS architecture to allow for latency, loss and jitter
    as properties. It describes requirements and control plane implication for latency
    and packet loss as a traffic engineering performance metric in today's network
    which is consisting of potentially multiple layers of packet transport network
    and optical transport network in order to make a accurate end-to-end latency and
    loss prediction before a path is established. Note MPLS architecture for Multicast
    will be taken up in a future version of the draft.</p>"
