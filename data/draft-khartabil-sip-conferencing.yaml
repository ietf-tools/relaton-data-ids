abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol [1] has been defined for the establishment,
    maintenance and termination of calls between one or more users. This document
    takes the Event Notification in SIP extension [4] further and identifies a method
    for Conferencing using SIP [1]. We do not suggest any extensions to SIP in this
    document at all, but rather make use of current extensions available.</p>"
