abstract:
- content: "<p>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) is chartered and proposed to solve the problem
    of time-based, scheduled changes, including the variations of links, adjacencies,
    cost, and traffic volumes in some cases. In a satellite network, the network is
    in continual motion which will cause detrimental consequences on the routing issue.
    However, each network node in a satellite network follows a predefined orbit around
    the Earth and represents an appropriate example of time-based scheduled mobility.
    Therefore, TVR can be implemented to improve the routing and forwarding process
    in satellite networks. This document mainly focuses on the use cases in this scenario.</p>"
