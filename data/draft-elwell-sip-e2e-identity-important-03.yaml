abstract:
- content: "<p>This document surveys existing mechanisms in the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) for identifying and authenticating the source of a SIP request
    (or caller identification). It describes how identification and authentication
    are not always end-to-end and the problems that this can lead to, particularly
    since media security based on techniques such as DTLS-SRTP is dependent on end-to-end
    authenticated identification of parties. This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org
    mailing list.</p>"
