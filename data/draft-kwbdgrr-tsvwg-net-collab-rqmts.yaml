abstract:
- content: "<p>Collaborative signaling from host-to-network (i.e., client-to-network
    and server-to-network) can improve the user experience by informing the network
    about the nature and relative importance of packets (frames, streams, etc.) without
    having to disclose the content of the packets. Moreover, the collaborative signaling
    may be enabled so that clients and servers are aware of the network's treatment
    of incoming packets. Also, client-to-network collaboration can be put in place
    without revealing the identity of the remote servers. This collaboration allows
    for differentiated services at the network (e.g., packet discard preference),
    the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of server/client
    and the network. This document lists some use cases that illustrate the need for
    a mechanism to share metadata and outlines host-to-network requirements. The document
    focuses on signaling information about a UDP transport flow (UDP 4-tuple).</p>"
