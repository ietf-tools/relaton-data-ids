abstract:
- content: "<p>Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the Quality
    of Experience (QoE) of the users of network services. This document surveys a
    set of recommendations about the maximum latency tolerated by the users of delay-constrained
    services. Some recommendations already exist for VoIP, but emerging services as
    e.g. online gaming, have different requirements. Different papers in the literature
    reporting these constraints are surveyed, and a summary of the latency limits
    for each service is finally provided.</p>"
