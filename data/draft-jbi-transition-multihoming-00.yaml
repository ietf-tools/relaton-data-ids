abstract:
- content: "<p>How to make IPv4 users utilize IPv6 applications is a typical scenario
    of the IPv4/IPv6 inter-operation. Nowadays, Tunnel Broker and 6to4 tunnel mechanisms
    are the popular solutions for this problem. This paper proposes a multihoming
    based algorithm MI46 to integrate Tunnel Broker and 6to4 tunnel mechanism. It
    overcomes the shortcomings of both Tunnel Broker and the 6to4 tunnel mechanism
    to form an optimized method to make the IPv4 users use the IPv6 applications.</p>"
