abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Pseudo Random Function (PRF) based on MAC function
    (keyed iterated hash function), and offers a ref- erence implementation of PRF
    based on SHA-1. This PRF can be used to produce cryptographic keys for authen-
    tication/integrity and encryption. It uses pre-shared secret and publicly known
    random value (and possibly parties’ identi- ties). The main advantage of this
    algorithm over other similar ones is that its security is formally tied to the
    MAC property of the underlying function.</p>"
