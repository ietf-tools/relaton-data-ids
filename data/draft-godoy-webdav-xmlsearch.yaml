abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies xml-search, a search grammar for use with the
    Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) SEARCH protocol. It extends
    the DAV:basicsearch grammar with XPath expressions that are evaluated on resources'
    properties whose values are XML fragments. The full expression power of XPath
    may exceed the requirement in simple use cases; therefore, some provisions are
    made in order to reduce the computational cost of evaluating allowed queries.</p>"
