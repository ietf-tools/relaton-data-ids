abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines generalized primitives for use in establishing
    end-to-end confidentiality in multiparty communications. These primitives address
    three essential elements of group privacy: authentication, group membership, and
    secure key exchange. The purpose is to define these primitives in such a way as
    they may be leveraged as common constructs within new and existing secure group
    communications protocols, and in support of both centralized and decentralized
    architectures.</p>"
