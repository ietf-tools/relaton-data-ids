abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the inter-working of a SIP (Session Initiation
    Protocol) User Agent, SUA, located into a software instance of a IP phone (Softphone),
    and a SIP Proxy located in the access network where the user connects to Internet.
    The model addressed is the one of a customer using a service offered by a service
    provider, and the operation described only applies to the negotiation and management
    of such kind of services. The network architecture is supposed to be private,
    and the service provider is in charge to negotiate network resources with network
    provider(s) on behalf of the customer, if necessary. Aim of this draft is to highlight
    the need of inter-working functions that allows service providers to use network-driven
    SIP messages to establish and manage multimedia over IP connections.</p>"
