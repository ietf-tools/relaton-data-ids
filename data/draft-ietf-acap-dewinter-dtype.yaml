abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed to
    support remote storage and access of program option, configuration and preference
    information. In certain circumstances, it is desirable or necessary to deal with
    information that has a limit imposed on it. While the general ACAP specification
    does provide for a (SYNTAX) alert to inform the submittor that the stored information
    was not in a valid syntax for that field, there is no generic method to discover
    that syntax. There is strong feeling in the ACAP working group that variable length
    strings should be used for data where possible, but there is also the knowledge
    that ACAP will be used to configure and access existing systems where the use
    of such variable length strings may be difficult or impossible.</p>"
