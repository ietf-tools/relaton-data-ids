abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of protocols have been defined at the IETF to handle IP mobility
    and multi-homing - each of the defined protocols satisfies a different set of
    requirements - however, there is an overlap on some of the requirements and features
    among many of these protocols. In practice, a combination of the protocols are
    likely to be deployed in a system. There are various such combinations plausible,
    but some combinations are more realistic than others. This document analyzes the
    overall mobility and multi-homing architecture and highlights some key points
    to consider while deploying an architecture consisting of one or more of these
    protocols. The protocols considered in scope for this document include Mobile
    IPv4 (MIPv4), Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), Fast Mobile
    IPv6 (FMIPv6), Network-based Local Mobility Management (NetLMM), MOBIKE, Host
    Identity Protocol (HIP), and Shim6.</p>"
