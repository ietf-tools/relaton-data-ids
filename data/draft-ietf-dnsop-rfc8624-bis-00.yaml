abstract:
- content: "<p>&lt;EDITOR NOTE: This document does not change the status (MUST, MAY,
    RECOMMENDED, etc) of any of the algorithms listed in [RFC8624]; that is the work
    of future documents. Instead, this document moves the canonical list of algorithms
    from [RFC8624] to an IANA registry. This is done for two reasons: 1) to allow
    the list to be updated more easily, and, much more importantly, 2) to allow the
    list to be more easily referenced.&gt; The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various
    cryptographic algorithms to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non-existence.
    To ensure interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers,
    it is necessary to specify both a set of algorithm implementation requirements
    and usage guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations
    support. This document updates [RFC8624] by moving the canonical source of algorithm
    implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC from [RFC8624] to an
    IANA registry. Future extensions to this registry can be made under new, incremental
    update RFCs.</p>"
