- content: "<p>The Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) 2 workshop
    workshop [CARISEvent], sponsored by the Internet Society, took place 28 February
    and 1 March 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Participants spanned regional,
    national, international, and enterprise CSIRTs, operators, service providers,
    network and security operators, transport operators and researchers, incident
    response researchers, vendors, and participants from standards communities. This
    workshop continued the work started at the first CARIS workshop, with a focus
    for CARIS 2 on scaling incident prevention and detection as the Internet industry
    moves to stronger and a more ubiquitous deployment of session encryption.</p>"
