abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes an optional fast-track way to get from a working
    group document to IESG review that can be used for cases when working group chairs
    believe that there is running code that implements a working group Internet-Draft.
    The basic idea is to do all of working group last call, IETF last call and area
    director review during the same two week period, to impose a higher barrier for
    comments that might block progress, and to require prompt action by authors in
    processing any changes arising from IETF last call. The motivation is to have
    the IETF process explicitly consider running code, consistent with the IETF's
    overall philosophy of running code and rough consensus. The intent is to run an
    RFC 3933 process experiment to test out this approach. [[This draft is proposed
    by the author and not the IESG.]]</p>"
