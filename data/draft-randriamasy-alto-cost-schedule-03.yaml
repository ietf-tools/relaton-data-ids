abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning network related information.
    This allows applications to make informed decisions, for example when selecting
    a target host from a set of candidates. The ALTO problem statement [RFC5693] considers
    typical applications as file sharing, real-time communication and live streaming
    peer-to-peer networks. Recently other use cases focused on Content Distribution
    Networks and Data Centers have emerged. The present draft proposes to extend the
    cost information provided by the ALTO protocol. The purpose is to broaden the
    decision possibilities of applications to not only decide 'where' to connect to,
    but also 'when'. This is useful to applications that have a degree of freedom
    on when to schedule data transfers, such as non- instantaneous data replication
    between data centers or service provisioning to end systems with irregular connectivity.
    The draft therefore specifies a new cost mode, called the "schedule" mode. In
    this mode the ALTO server offers cost maps that contain path ratings that are
    valid for a given timeframe (e.g. hourly) for a period of time (e.g. a day). Besides
    the functional time-shift enhancement providing multi-timeframe cost values, the
    ALTO Cost Schedule also allows to save a number of ALTO transactions and thus
    resources on the ALTO server and clients. Last, guidance to schedule application
    traffic can also efficiently help for load balancing and resources efficiency.</p>
