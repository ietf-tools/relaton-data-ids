abstract:
- content: <p>The design of HTTP--how every application and service on the web communicates
    today--can positively impact user experience, operational and environmental costs,
    and even the battery life of the devices you carry around. Improving HTTP starts
    with speed. Apps--not just browsers--should get faster too. More and more, apps
    are how people access web services, in addition to their browser. Improving HTTP
    should also make mobile better, particularly to ensure great battery life and
    low network cost on constrained devices. People and their apps should stay in
    control of network access. Finally, to achieve rapid adoption, HTTP 2.0 needs
    to retain as much compatibility as possible with the existing Web infrastructure.
    Done right, HTTP 2.0 can help people connect their devices and applications to
    the Internet fast, reliably, and securely over a number of diverse networks, with
    great battery life and low cost. This document describes "HTTP Speed+Mobility,"
    a proposal for HTTP 2.0 that emphasizes performance improvements and security
    while at the same time accounting for the important needs of mobile devices and
    applications. The proposal starts from both the Google SPDY protocol and the work
    the IETF has done around WebSockets. The proposal is not a final product but rather
    is intended to form a baseline for working group discussion.</p>
