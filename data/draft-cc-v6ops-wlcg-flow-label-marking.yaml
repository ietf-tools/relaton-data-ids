abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimentally deployed approach currently
    used within the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG) to mark
    packets with their project (experiment) and application. The marking uses the
    20-bit IPv6 Flow Label in each packet, with 15 bits used for semantics (community
    and activity) and 5 bits for entropy. Alternatives, in particular use of IPv6
    Extension Headers (EH), were considered but found to not be practical. The WLCG
    is one of the largest worldwide research communities and has adopted IPv6 heavily
    for movement of many hundreds of PB of data annually, with the ultimate goal of
    running IPv6 only.</p>"
