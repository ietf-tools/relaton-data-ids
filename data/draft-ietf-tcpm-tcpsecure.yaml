    off-path packet injection attacks by relying on the fact that it is difficult
    to guess the 4-tuple (the source and destination IP addresses and the source and
    destination ports) in combination with the 32-bit sequence number(s). A combination
    of increasing window sizes and applications using longer-term connections (e.g.,
    H-323 or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
