abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol described in this document is designed to provide access
    to the X.500 Directory while not incurring the resource requirements of the Directory
    Access Protocol (DAP).This protocol is specifically targeted at simple management
    applications and browser applications that provide simple read/write interactive
    access to the X.500 Directory, and is intended to be a complement to the DAP itself.
