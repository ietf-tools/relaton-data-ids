abstract:
- content: "<p>PACE technology is designed to provide backwards-compatible modifications
    to Ethernet to support multimedia applications. PACE Technology's Ethernet Interactive
    Access [1] uses a modified 802.3 MAC access algorithm to minimise access latency
    when communicating to standard 802.3 MAC devices. This access algorithm is documented
    here via pseudo code in a manner similar to the 802.3 MAC standard.</p>"
