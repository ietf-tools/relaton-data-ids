abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft complements the work of MPTCP by defining a TCP Splitter/
    Combiner Architecture (SCA) that enables non-MPTCP-capable single- homed hosts
    to benefit from the multiple paths within Internet by means of performance enhancing
    proxies (PEPs) placed in the access networks. SCA Proxies (SCAPs) make use of
    multiple paths in a way which is completely transparent to end-hosts. Since the
    existence of the SCAPs is shielded from the TCP end-points, they can be deployed
    in the Internet as well as on the end-systems.</p>"
