abstract:
- content: "<p>Standardization of Instant Message and Presence Protocols in the IETF
    has resulted in multiple protocols. There are significant industry and technical
    advantages to standardizing a unified approach for server-to-server Instant Messaging
    and Presence. This document proposes a server profile which uses SIP to exchange
    presence and setup sessions, and XMPP for message transport.</p>"
