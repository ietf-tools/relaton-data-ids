abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how personal contact information may be exchanged
    in a structured format suitable for machine processing. The SGML-based Personal
    Contact Information (SPCI) format can be used to encode personal information of
    the type which might be found on a business card, in a form which is also suitable
    for human interpretation. Possible uses of this format include: exchange of personal
    information in email messages; encoding author information within a document;
    providing information about a mailing list; as an exchange format for 'address
    book' databases; and providing contact information for a company. The SPCI information
    is encoded using SGML, and the specification is aligned with the SHAVE rules.
    A MIME body part type is defined for SPCI information.</p>"
