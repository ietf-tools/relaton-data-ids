abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural
    framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between
    the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES
    NE). RFC5812 has defined the ForCES Model which provides a formal way to represent
    the capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements(FEs) within
    the context of the ForCES protocol. More specifically, the model describes the
    logical functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these functions
    support, and how these functions are or can be interconnected. The control elements
    (CEs) can control the FEs using the ForCES model definition. The ForCES WG charter
    has been extended to allow the LFB topology to be across FEs. This documents describes
    a non-intrusive way to extend the LFB topology across FEs.</p>"
