abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all kinds
    of information including resources, services and data. With many proposals of
    novel network architectures emerging, such as DONA, ICN NDN, the location-based
    routing starts to transfer to the content based ones. Currently, it is incompatible
    that many different information naming schemes are adopted in different network
    proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names in NDN. The
    proposed naming scheme using a hybrid naming structure, including hierarchical
    components, and the properties of the component assembly plane. The hybrid naming
    (hn) scheme enables to identify different routing information uniformly, and provides
    many great advantages, such as high aggregation, limited length, suffix holes
    remission, fuzzy matching support, high security and good compatibility with IPv4/IPv6,
    DONA, CCN/NDN and so on.</p>"
