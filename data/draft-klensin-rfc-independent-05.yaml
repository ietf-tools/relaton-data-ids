abstract:
- content: <p>There is a long-term tradition in the Internet community, predating
    the IETF by many years, of use of the RFC series to publish materials that are
    not rooted in the IETF standards process and its review and approval mechanisms.
    These documents, known as "independent submissions", serve a number of important
    functions for the Internet community, both inside and outside of the community
    of active IETF participants. This document discusses the independent submission
    model and some reasons why it is important. It then describes editorial and processing
    norms that can be used for independent submissions as the community goes forward
    into new relationships between the IETF community and its primary technical publisher.</p>
