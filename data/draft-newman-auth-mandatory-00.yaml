abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the ``mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanism''
    problem (at the per-TCP-connection level), describes the requirements necessary
    for a solution, and identifies the mechanisms which meet a significant subset
    of the requirements. It is hoped this will help the IETF come to an understanding
    of the problem and a rough consensus on a solution.</p>"
