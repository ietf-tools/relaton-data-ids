abstract:
- content: "<p>[draft-ietf-dnsind-tsig-*.txt] provides a means of authenticating and
    securing Domain Name System (DNS) queries and responses using shared secret keys
    via the TSIG resource record (RR). However, it provides no mechanism for setting
    up such keys other than manual exchange. This document describes a TKEY RR that
    can be used in a number of different modes to establish shared secret keys between
    a DNS resolver and server. [changes from last draft: add IANA considerations section,
    make time fields module 2**32, minor edits, update author info,...]</p>"
