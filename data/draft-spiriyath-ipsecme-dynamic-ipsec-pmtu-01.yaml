abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery (PLPMTUD)
    procedures for IPSec tunnels. In these procedures, the encrypting node discovers
    and maintains a running estimate of the tunnel MTU. In order to do this, the encrypting
    nodes sends Probe Packets of various size through the IPSec tunnel. If the size
    of Probe Packet exceeds the tunnel MTU, a downstream node discards the packet
    and sends an ICMP PTB message to the encrypting node. The encrypting node ignores
    the ICMP PTB message. If the size of the Probe Packet does not exceed the tunnel
    MTU and the decrypting node receives the Probe Packet, the decrypting node sends
    an Acknowledgement Packet to encrypting node through the IPSec tunnel. The Acknowledgement
    Packet indicates the size of the Probe Packet. The procedures described in this
    document are applicable to IPSec tunnels that are signaled by IKEv2 and provide
    authentication services.</p>"
