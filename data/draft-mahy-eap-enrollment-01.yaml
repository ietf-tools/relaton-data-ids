abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new EAP Method intended to automatically
    enroll clients with minimal user interaction in a wireless LAN environment. The
    enrollment process involves the client providing weak possibly temporary credentials
    and the server providing stronger persistent credentials, both stages over a TLS-protected
    channel.</p>"
