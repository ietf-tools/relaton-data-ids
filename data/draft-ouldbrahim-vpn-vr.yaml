abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a network based VPN architecture using virtual
    routers. The VPN service is built based on the virtual router (VR) concept, which
    has exactly the same mechanisms as a physical router, and therefore inherits all
    existing mechanisms and tools for configuration, operation, accounting, and maintenance.
    Within a VPN domain, an instance of routing is used to distribute VPN reachability
    information among VR routers. Any routing protocol can be used, and no VPN-related
    modifications or extensions are needed to the routing protocol for achieving VPN
    reachability. Virtual routers can be deployed in different VPN configurations,
    direct VR to VR connectivity through layer-2 or by aggregating multiple VRs into
    a single VR combined with IP or MPLS based tunnels. This architecture accommodates
    different backbone deployment scenarios, e.g. where the service provider owns
    their own backbone, and where the service provider obtains backbone service from
    one or more other service providers.</p>"
