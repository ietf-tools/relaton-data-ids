abstract:
- content: <p>This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
    a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information, colloquially
    termed a geolocation "feed". Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds
    to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures. Some technical
    organizations operating networks that move from one conference location to the
    next have already experimentally published small geolocation feeds. At least one
    consumer (Google) has incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data
    pipeline.</p>
