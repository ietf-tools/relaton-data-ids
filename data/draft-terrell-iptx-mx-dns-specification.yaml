abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the IPtX Specification for the 'Domain Name Service'
    (IPtX / IPtX-MX DNS), and eliminates the possibility of an Addressing 'Conflict',
    or a Mathematical Addressing Error in the IPtX Address Space when using Multiple
    IPtX Addressing Formats. In other words, the IPtX / IPtX-MX IP Addressing format
    on the "Back-End", or "Backbone", obtains its uniqueness through the use and /
    or difference defined by the accuracy of the 'Exponential Decimal String'. However,
    this uniqueness, if not clarified, would not be discernable on the "Front-End",
    because the IPtX IP Addressing Specification 'Allows' only a '48' Bit-Mapped IP
    Address, or 2 Octets and 4 '10 Bit-Quadrants', and up to 60 Bits for every IP
    Addressing Format greater than IPt1. That is, on the "Front-End", if there is
    No distinction, because every Addressing Format in the IPtX Specification, when
    Resolved, is Equal, there will ultimately be Address Conflicts within the Addressing
    Scheme. Nevertheless, this clarification, when used in conjunction with the IPtX
    32 / 64 Bit Header, allows the simultaneous use of (2E24) 16,777,216 different
    IPtX / IPtX-MX IP Addressing Specifications; the Concurrent use of the IPtX /
    IPtX-MX IP Addressing Specifications 'IPt1' thru 'IPt16,777,216'.</p>
