abstract:
- content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to provide means of personal,
    terminal, and service mobility in a mobile Internet. This document describes two
    schemes for supporting service mobility in a SIP environment. The first assumes
    that call states are maintained and stored within the network and home network
    always controls calls and services of its subscribers. The second assumes that
    call states are stored in the mobile stations (MSs) and managed in a distributed
    manner, and the visited network controls users' calls and services.</p>"
