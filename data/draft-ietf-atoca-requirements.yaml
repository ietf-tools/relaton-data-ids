abstract:
- content: "<p>Before, during and after emergency situations various agencies need
    to provide information to a group of persons or to the public within a geographical
    area. While many aspects of such systems are specific to national or local jurisdictions,
    emergencies span such boundaries and notifications need to reach visitors from
    other jurisdictions. This document provides terminology, requirements and an architectural
    description for protocols exchanging alerts between IP-based end points.</p>"
