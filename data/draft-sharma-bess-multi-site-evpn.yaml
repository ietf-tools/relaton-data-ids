abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the procedures for interconnecting two or more
    Network Virtualization Overlays (NVOs) with EVPN via NVO over IP-only network.
    The solution interconnects Ethernet VPN network by using NVO with Ethernet VPN
    (EVPN) to facilitate the interconnect in a scalable fashion. The motivation is
    to support extension of Layer-2 and Layer-3, Unicast &amp; Multicast, VPNs without
    having to rely on typical Data Center Interconnect (DCI) technologies like MPLS/VPLS.
    The requirements for the interconnect are similar to the ones specified in [RFC7209],
    "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)". In particular, this document describes
    the difference of the Gateways (GWs) procedure and combined functionality from
    [RFC9014], "Interconnect Solution for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Overlay Networks" and
    and [EVPN-IPVPN], "EVPN Interworking with IPVPN", which this solution is interoperable
    to. This document updates and replaces all previous version of Multi-site EVPN
    based VXLAN using Border Gateways (draft- sharma-multi-site-evpn).</p>
