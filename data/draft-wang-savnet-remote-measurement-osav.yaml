abstract:
- content: "<p>Outbound IP spoofing, where attackers send packets with forged source
    IP addresses, poses a significant threat to Internet security. Measuring the deployment
    of outbound source address validation (OSAV) is critical for characterizing the
    vulnerability to outbound IP spoofing across the global Internet. Remote measurement
    of OSAV deployment offers a practical method for measuring numerous Autonomous
    Systems (ASes) efficiently. This document presents a method for remotely measuring
    the deployment status of OSAV, without cooperations from volunteers in remote
    networks.</p>"
