abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) package
    containing the MoveConnection command which was originally proposed in RFC 2705
    [4]. The MoveConnection command can move an MGCP connection from one endpoint
    in a media gateway to another endpoint in the same gateway. This can be very useful
    in order to support redirection of media streams across endpoints in a media gateway.</p>"
