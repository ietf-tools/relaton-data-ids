abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a guideline for creating civic address consideration
    documents for individual countries, as required by RFC 4776. Since civic addresses
    may have a different format in individual countries, such address considerations
    are necessary in order to map the civic address elements to the PIDF Location
    Object (PIDF-LO) elements.</p>"
