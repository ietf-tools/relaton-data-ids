abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes extensions to the OSPF protocol to support QoS
    routes. The focus of this document is on the algorithms used to compute QoS routes
    and on the necessary modifications to OSPF to support this function, e.g., the
    information needed, its format, how it is distributed, and how it is used by the
    QoS path selection process. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>"
