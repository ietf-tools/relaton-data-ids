abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) is a new MPLS paradigm in which each SR-capable
    router is required to advertise global MPLS labels or Segment IDs (SID ) for its
    attached prefixes by using link-state IGPs, e.g., IS- IS. One major challenge
    associated with such global MPLS label or SID advertisement mechanism is how to
    avoid a given global MPLS label or SID from being allocated by different routers
    to different prefixes. Although such global label or SID allocation collision
    problem can be addressed through manual allocation , it is error- prone and nonautomatic
    therefore may not be suitable in large-scale SR network environments. This document
    proposes an alternative approach for allocating and advertising global MPLS labels
    or SIDs via IS-IS so as to eliminate the potential risk of label allocation collision.</p>"
