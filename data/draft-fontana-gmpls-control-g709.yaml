- content: "<p>Along with the current development of packet over lambda switching,
    there is considerable development in transport systems based on the ITU-T G.709
    specification. For that purpose, the inter-working of G.709 capable devices on
    top lambda switched networks is relevant to new optical developments at the OIF
    and IETF.</p>"
