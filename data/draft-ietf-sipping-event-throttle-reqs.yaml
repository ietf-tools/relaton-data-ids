abstract:
- content: "<p>All event packages are required to specify a maximum rate at which
    event notifications are generated by a single notifier. Such a limit is provided
    in order to reduce network congestion. In addition to the fixed limits introduced
    by specific event packages, further mechanisms for limiting the rate of event
    notification are also allowed to be defined by event package specifications but
    none have been specified so far. This memo discusses the requirements for a throttle
    mechanism that allows a subscriber to further limit the rate of event notification.</p>"
