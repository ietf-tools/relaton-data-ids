abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft attempts to fill a portion of the gap between DNSSEC deployment
    expectations and the lack of DNSSEC trust anchor key management solutions, protocol
    and procedural aspects. Specific requirements are stated at a level of abstraction
    that should accommodate solution alternatives to the issues of providing trust
    anchor keys to DNSSEC-aware resolvers, and rolling those keys. Nonetheless, the
    characteristics the DNSSEC protocols and the DNS operation contingencies do shape
    many of the requirements.</p>"
