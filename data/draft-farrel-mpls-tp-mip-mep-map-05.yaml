abstract:
- content: <p>The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) within
    the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate
    Points (MIPs) may be situated within network nodes at the incoming and outgoing
    interfaces. This document describes a way of forming OAM messages so that they
    can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing interfaces, forwarded
    correctly through the "switch fabric", and handled efficiently in node implementations
    where there is no distinction between the incoming and outgoing MIP. The material
    in this document is provided for discussion within the MPLS-TP community in the
    expectation that this idea or some similar mechanism will be subsumed into a more
    general MPLS-TP OAM document. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network.</p>
