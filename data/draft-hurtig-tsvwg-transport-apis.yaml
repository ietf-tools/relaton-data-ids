abstract:
- content: "<p>Commonly used networking APIs are currently limited by the transport
    layer's inability to expose services instead of protocols. An API/ application/user
    is therefore forced to use exactly the services that are implemented by the selected
    transport. This document surveys networking APIs and discusses how they can be
    improved by a more expressive transport layer that hides and automatizes the choice
    of the transport protocol.</p>"
