abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries, primarily
    those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group
    of the IETF. Three aspects make IPPM metric registration difficult: (1) Use of
    the Type-P notion to allow users to specify their own packet types. (2) Use of
    Flexible input variables, called Parameters in IPPM definitions, some which determine
    the quantity measured and others which should not be specified until execution
    of the measurement. (3) Allowing flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize
    the results on a stream of measurement packets. Specifically, this memo investigates
    registry entries that would follow from RFC 3393, the specification IP Packet
    Delay Variation that allows for many different forms of unique metrics, as a difficult
    and important test of the registry structure.</p>"
