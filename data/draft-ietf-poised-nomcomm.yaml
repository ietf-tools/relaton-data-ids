abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft reflects one person's recollection as to a rough consensus
    reached in December, 1992 with respect to the selection and confirmation of individuals
    serving on the IAB and IESG. The author has taken great care to record only those
    aspects of the process which were clearly discussed. Reviewers of this draft are
    encouraged to take similar care. Once there is broad agreement on this recollection,
    then this draft will be used as a contribution to the working group responsible
    for fine-tuning the selection and confirmation process.</p>"
