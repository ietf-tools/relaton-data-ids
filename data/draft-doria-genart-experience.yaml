abstract:
- content: "<p>The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) has been doing reviews of Internet-Drafts
    (I-Ds) since 2004. This document discusses the experience and the lessons learned
    over the past 7 years of this process. The review team initially reviewed the
    I-Ds before each of the IESG telechats. Since late 2005, review team members have
    been assigned to review I-Ds during IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last Call is
    necessary for the I-D. The same reviewer then reviews any updates when the I-D
    is placed on an IESG telechat agenda. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
