abstract:
- content: "<p>A node may have support for communications using both IPv4 and IPv6
    protocols. Such a node may wish to obtain both IPv4 and IPv6 configuration settings
    via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This can be done by using
    the IPv4 and the IPv6 DHC protocols respectively. This document considers mechanisms
    that allow such a node to make use of the configuration data from both protocols
    to obtain the desired common configuration.</p>"
