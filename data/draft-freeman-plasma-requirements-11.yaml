abstract:
- content: "<p>S/MIME delivers confidentiality, integrity, and data origination authentication
    for email. However, there are many situations where organizations also want robust
    access control applied to information in messages. The Enhanced Security Services
    (ESS) RFC5035 for S/MIME defines an access control mechanism for email, but the
    access check happens after the data is decrypted by the recipient which devalues
    the protection afforded by the cryptography and provides very weak guarantees
    of policy compliance. Another major issues for S/MIME is its dependency on a single
    type of identity credential, an X.509 certificate. Many users on the Internet
    today do not have X.509 certificates and therefore cannot use S/MIME. Furthermore,
    the requirement to discover the X.509 certificate for every recipient of an encrypted
    message by the sender has proven to be an unreliable process for a number of reasons.
    This document presents requirements for an alternative model to ESS to address
    the identified issues with access control in order to deliver more robust compliance
    for S/MIME protected messages. This document describes an access control model
    which uses cryptographic keys to enforce access control policy decisions where
    the policy check is performed prior to the decryption of the message contents.
    This authorization model can be instantiated using many existing standards and
    is in not intended to be a one off just for email, being applicable to other data
    types. This document also presents requirements for the abstraction of the specifics
    of the authentication technologies used by S/MIME users. The abstraction makes
    it possible for other forms of authentication credentials to be used with S/MIME
    thereby enabling much broader adoption. The authentication abstraction model also
    removes the dependency on the need to discover encryption keys by the sender.
    This abstraction can be used independently from access control to enable simple
    scenarios where authentication of the recipient is sufficient to grant access
    to the message. The name Plasma was assigned to this effort as part of the IETF
    process. It is derived from PoLicy enhAnced Secure eMAil.</p>"
