abstract:
- content: "<p>Time zone information serves as a basic protocol element in protocols,
    such as the calendaring suite and DHCP. The Time Zone (TZ) Database specifies
    the indices used in various protocols, as well as their semantic meanings, for
    all localities throughout the world. This database has been meticulously maintained
    and distributed free of charge by a group of volunteers, coordinated by a single
    volunteer who is now planning to retire. This memo specifies procedures involved
    with maintenance of the TZ database and associated code, including how to submit
    proposed updates, how decisions for inclusion of those updates are made, and the
    selection of a designated expert by and for the time zone community. The intent
    of this memo is, to the extent possible, to document existing practice and provide
    a means to ease succession of the database maintainers. This memo documents an
    Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
