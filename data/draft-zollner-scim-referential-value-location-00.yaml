abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management standard's schema RFC
    [RFC7643], as well as custom schemas, may have attribute values that have a finite
    set of acceptable values. These acceptable values are frequently tied to a value
    on another resource. For instance, an organization may only allow values in the
    Enterprise User schema's costCenter attribute that are valid identifiers of cost
    centers defined in another location. This draft aims to provide a way for a SCIM
    client to determine if an attribute in a schema is limited to a specific set of
    values, and where those values may be located on another SCIM resource type.</p>"
