abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying cryptographically-signed
    call information about personal communications, to include rich meta-data about
    a call and caller that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted, and
    subsequently rendered to the called party. This framework is intended to include
    and extend caller and call specific information beyond human-readable display
    name comparable to the "Caller ID" function common on the telephone network. The
    JSON element defined for this purpose, Rich Call Data (RCD), is an extensible
    object defined to either be used as part of STIR or with SIP Call-Info to include
    related information about calls that helps people decide whether to answer an
    incoming set of communications from another party. This signing of the RCD information
    is also enhanced with a integrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring
    and transport of this information between authoritative and non- authoritative
    parties generating and signing the Rich Call Data for support of different usage
    and content policies.</p>
