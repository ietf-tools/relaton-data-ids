abstract:
- content: "<p>With network-based applications becoming prevalent, solutions that
    provide connectivity over wide area become more attractive for customers. In small-to-medium
    enterprise sector, Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), is a very useful service
    provider offering. It creates an emulated LAN segments fully capable of learning
    and forwarding Ethernet MAC addresses. Today, in VPLS implementations, within
    the context of a VPLS PE (VE), a single-site is selected from which all PWs are
    rooted. The site- election mechanism is usually hard-coded by different vendors
    (e.g. minimum or maximum site-id), and as such, is outside end-users control.
    This offers no flexibility to end-users as it forces them to define the site-id
    allocation scheme well in advance, or deal with the consequences of a suboptimal
    site-id election. Moreover, whenever the elected site-id is declared down, the
    traffic to and from all other sites hosted within the same VE is impacted as well.
    This draft defines protocol extensions to keep core-facing pseudowires (PWs) established
    at all times, regardless of the events taking place on the attachment-circuit
    (AC) segment when using the BGP-based signaling procedures.</p>"
