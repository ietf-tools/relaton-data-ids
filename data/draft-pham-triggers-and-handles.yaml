abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a communication mechanism named 'triggers and
    handles' between service logic and network elements. The concept defines a trigger
    as a notification that a network element sends to the service logic. A handle
    is defined as a command that the service logic sends to a network element. Triggers
    are bound to network events and allow network elements to notify service logic
    of occurring events in the network whereas handles allow taking control of network
    elements.</p>"
