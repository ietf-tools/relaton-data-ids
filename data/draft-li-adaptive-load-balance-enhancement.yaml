abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an adaptive load-balancing mechanism to address
    high-throughput transmission challenges in East-West computing, data exchange,
    and DC interconnection services. Traditional methods-ECMP, RPS, and Flowlet-face
    limitations: ECMP suffers from hash collisions and load imbalance; RPS risks TCP
    packet reordering; Flowlet depends on impractical manual thresholds for burst
    interval configuration, leading to suboptimal performance.</p>"
