abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a privacy protection scheme for the AKA agreement
    in the 3GPP standards. Specifically, this document RECOMMENDS that each user owns
    a encryption key updated in real time, with which to encrypt the user identity.
    Comparing with the asymmetric encryption and alias assignment, the symmetric encryption
    scheme proposed in this document not only reduce the computation burden, but also
    prevent the legal user from being located and tracked.</p>"
