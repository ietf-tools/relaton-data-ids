abstract:
- content: "<p>It is considered that a routing optimization mechanism between mobile
    nodes and existing IPv4 nodes is important especially in IPv4 mobility support.
    An idea to realize the routing optimization is to introduce special router with
    en/decapsulation function and binding cache. Technical issues for such a special
    router is considered to be 1) how to control its binding cache correctly and 2)
    how to control load balance for the routing optimization processing. This memo
    describes protocols to solve the technical issues and realize the special router.</p>"
