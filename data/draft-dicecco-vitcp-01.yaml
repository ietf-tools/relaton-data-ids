abstract:
- content: "<p>The Virtual Interface (VI) architecture [VIAR] describes a high performance
    design for interfacing distributed applications to accelerated protocol processing.
    VI seeks to improve the performance of such applications by reducing the latency
    and overheads associated with standard communications protocol stack processing.
    VI greatly reduces the processing overhead associated with traditional network
    architectures by providing applications a protected, directly accessible interface
    to network hardware - a Virtual Interface. This memo describes extensions to the
    VI Architecture designed to facilitate operation over TCP/IP. These extensions
    take the form of enhancements to the VI Provider Library API defined in the VI
    Architecture Developer's Guide [VIDG], and a 'VI Protocol' which supports VI functionality
    during operation over TCP/IP. The extensions to the VI Architecture which support
    operation over TCP/IP are intended to be fully compliant with the VI Architecture
    [VIAR] and its associated Developer's Guide [VIDG].</p>"
