abstract:
- content: "<p>This document documents some issues with the current definition of
    the backup subflows in [RFC6824]. The solution proposed in [RFC6824] works well
    when a subflow completely fails. However, if a subflow suffers from huge packet
    losses, but still remains up, then the delay to switch to the backup subflow may
    be very long. We propose to measure the evolution of the retransmission timer
    (RTO) to detect the bad performance of subflows.</p>"
