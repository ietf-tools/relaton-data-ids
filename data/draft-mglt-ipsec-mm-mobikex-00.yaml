abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides a description of MOBIKE mobility and multihoming
    extension (MOBIKE-X). The extension is elaborated from the MOBIKE [RFC4555] protocol
    as well as mobility and multihoming requirements described in [I-D.mglt-ipsec-mm-requirements].
    Extension concerns the Security Association facilities in a multihoming and mobile
    environment. More specifically this draft considers the use of multiple interfaces
    and the transport mode of IPsec. One of the goal of this draft was to make this
    extension compatible with MOBIKE [RFC4555]. We especially point out the differences
    from MOBIKE [RFC4555], as well as how its interacts with MOBIKE.</p>"
