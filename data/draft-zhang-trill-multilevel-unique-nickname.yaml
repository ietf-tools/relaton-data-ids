abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL routing can be extended to support multiple levels by building
    on the multilevel feature of IS-IS routing. Depending on how nicknames are managed,
    there are two primary alternatives to realize TRILL multilevel: the unique nickname
    approach and the aggregated nickname approach as discussed in [MultiL]. This document
    specifies the unique nickname approach. This approach gives unique nicknames to
    all TRILL switches across the multilevel TRILL campus.</p>"
