abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes changes to [RFC2544], specifically to packet
    throughput search methodology, by defining a new search algorithm referred to
    as Multiple Loss Ratio search (MLRsearch for short). Instead of relying on binary
    search with pre-set starting offered load, it proposes a novel approach discovering
    the starting point in the initial phase, and then searching for packet throughput
    based on defined packet loss ratio (PLR) input criteria and defined final trial
    duration time. One of the key design principles behind MLRsearch is minimizing
    the total test duration and searching for multiple packet throughput rates (each
    with a corresponding PLR) concurrently, instead of doing it sequentially. The
    main motivation behind MLRsearch is the new set of challenges and requirements
    posed by NFV (Network Function Virtualization), specifically software based implementations
    of NFV data planes. Using [RFC2544] in the experience of the authors yields often
    not repetitive and not replicable end results due to a large number of factors
    that are out of scope for this draft. MLRsearch aims to address this challenge
    in a simple way of getting the same result sooner, so more repetitions can be
    done to describe the replicability.</p>"
