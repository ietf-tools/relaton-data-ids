abstract:
- content: "<p>For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet universal,
    because an undocumented and unlabeled coded character set hampers information
    interchange, a 12-bit coded character set has been created that encodes the graphemes
    of the SignWriting script as described in the open standard of the International
    SignWriting Alphabet 2010. The x-ISWA-2010 coded character set is defined with
    hexadecimal characters and described with Unicode characters, either proposed
    characters on plane 1 or interchange characters on plane 15. This memo defines
    a standard coded character set for the Internet community. It is published for
    reference, examination, implementation, and evaluation. Distribution of this memo
    is unlimited.</p>"
