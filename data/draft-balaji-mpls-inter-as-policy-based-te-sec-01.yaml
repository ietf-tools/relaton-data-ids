abstract:
- content: "<p>For a short time sometime in the recent past , internet traffic sent
    between a well known site and subscribers to an internet service provider A passed
    through hardware belonging to a Telecom provider B other than the ISP A to which
    the customers were attached before reaching its final destination. Telecom Provider
    B was found to be many AS hops away from the well known site and ISP A. It was
    assumed that this was an an innocent routing error (which is the most likely explanation
    for the highly circuitous route that the traffic was taking), but it was troubling
    nonetheless. During a window that lasted 30 minutes to an hour, all unencrypted
    traffic passing between the victimised ISP's customers and the well known site
    might have been open to monitoring. Though there was no evidence any data was
    in fact snarfed, but it was felt that the potential for that is certainly there
    because the hardware belonged to the untrusted Telecom provider B. Many such incidents
    have occurred in the past where the traffic has been diverted through such providers
    that either erroneously have let loose BGP routes or otherwise. At least one of
    those incidents was the result of erroneous BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, routes
    that were quickly corrected. The above is a hypothetical headline that might occur
    in the near future if the BGP protocol is subject to such circuitous routing attacks
    either by mis-configuration or through purposeful intent. This is primarily owing
    to the fact that the BGP protocol accepts updates from providers and there exists
    no mechanism to figure out whether the updates for prefixes received was due to
    mal-intent, mis-configuration or indeed correct configuration. So there is a big
    blind spot that will have to be rectified. Doing the rectification through BGP
    would only complicate matters more. The proposal in the scheme in this draft,
    warrants the use of MPLS- based inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths
    that are constructed out of a derived inter-AS topology that help to impose policy
    decisions that for eg, obviate or prevent such LSPs from actually going through
    certain specific AS or set of ASes. Using methods like Graph construction from
    AS-PATH-INFO data and methods like policy based clipping of edges and nodes from
    such a inter-AS topology, the solution is made simple. The use of PCE (Path Computation
    Elements) is advised to compute such inter-AS paths that avoid ASes. Regular routing
    would have followed BGP updates and regular IP based forwarding. Using the TE-LSPs
    we can in fact set out the explicit route from AS to AS from the head-end to the
    tail-end avoiding specific set of ASes which dictated by policy have to be avoided.</p>"
