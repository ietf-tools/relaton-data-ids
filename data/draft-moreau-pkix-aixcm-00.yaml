abstract:
- content: '<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol does not support the use
    of client public key pairs without X.509 security certificates. This document
    circumvents this limitation: an end-entity has access to the public domain private
    key of a dummy (or "explicitly meaningless") Certification Authority (CA), and
    can thus freely issue an X.509 security certificate for interoperability purposes.
    Given these workaround requirement and solution approach, the document limits
    itself to the strict minimal set of standardization provisions. This supports
    the orderly cohabitation of auto issued certificates and normal TLS traffic relying
    on the full Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) model.</p>'
