abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces an advanced unidirectional route assessment metric
    and associated measurement methodology, based on the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
    Framework RFC 2330. This memo updates RFC 2330 in the areas of path-related terminology
    and path description, primarily to include the possibility of parallel subpaths
    between a given Source and Destination pair, owing to the presence of multi- path
    technologies.</p>"
