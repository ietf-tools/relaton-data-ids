abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents the Internet Group membership Authentication Protocol
    (IGAP), a protocol developed by NTT, Nortel Networks and Panasonic. IGAP provides
    IGMP's group membership control between hosts and their first-hop routers, with
    the addition of user authentication and accounting. IGAP is designed to be used
    in a controlled or managed IPv4 multicast environment, when authentication and
    accounting are required. The user authentication information in IGAP can enable
    a provider to control the distribution of the multicast traffic as well as to
    collect real time user accounting information in an environment where the last-hop
    access networks are not shared.</p>"
