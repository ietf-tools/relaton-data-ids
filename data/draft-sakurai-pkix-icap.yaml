abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a sub set of specifications how to issue, publish
    X.509 certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs). It also provides the
    certificate validation service by online. In the proposed specifications, the
    World Wide Web (WWW) is used for secure distributing certificates across a firewall
    in both human and machine readable syntax. These specifications define not only
    the protocols between the PKI clients and a single CA, but also the protocols
    between the CAs. With the CA-CA communications, the PKI clients can retrieve any
    certificates and CRLs without specifying the location of the appropriate CA, by
    only asking to the neighbor CA.</p>"
