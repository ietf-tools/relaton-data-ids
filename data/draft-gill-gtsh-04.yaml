abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of a packet's Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6)
    to protect a protocol stack from CPU-utilization based attacks has been proposed
    in many settings (see for example, RFC 2461). This document generalizes these
    techniques for use by other protocols such as BGP (RFC 1771), Multicast Source
    Discovery Protocol (MSDP), Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, and Label Distribution
    Protocol (LDP) (RFC 3036). While the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)
    is most effective in protecting directly connected protocol peers, it can also
    provide a lower level of protection to multi-hop sessions. GTSM is not directly
    applicable to protocols employing flooding mechanisms (e.g., multicast), and use
    of multi-hop GTSM should be considered on a case-by-case basis. This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
