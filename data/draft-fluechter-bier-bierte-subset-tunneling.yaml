abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER-TE extends BIER with tree engineering capabilities and can be
    supported by almost the same hardware. However, a bitstring in BIER- TE hold bits
    for BFERs and links, which effects that the size of supportable topologies in
    terms of BFERs is smaller for BIER-TE than for BIER. While for BIER, subsets can
    be utilized to improve scaling to large multicast domains, this mechanism requires
    adaptation for BIER-TE. In this document, requirements for BIER-TE subsets are
    defined, a mechanism is described for how BIER-TE packets can reach their subsets
    using tunneling, and 1:1 protection for the entire BIER-TE multicast tree is explained.
    The concept utilizes egress protection for reaching a subset when the ingress
    BFIR of the subset fails.</p>"
