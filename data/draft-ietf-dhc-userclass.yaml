abstract:
- content: "<p>This option is used by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    client to optionally identify the type or category of user or applications it
    represents. The information contained in this option is an opaque field that represents
    the user class of which the client is a member. Based on this class, a DHCP server
    selects the appropriate address pool to assign an address to the client and the
    appropriate configuration parameters. This option should be configurable by a
    user. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
