abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail relies on exchanges between systems that have made no
    prior arrangement with each other. Widespread abuse of the email system has led
    operators to demand accountability for the email their receiving SMTP servers
    are being asked to process. Certified Server Validation (CSV) provides an economical
    service that permits a receiving SMTP server to decide whether a sending SMTP
    client is likely to produce well-behaved traffic, or at least to decide whether
    the client is sufficiently accountable for its actions. CSV provides a small,
    simple and useful improvement to Internet mail service accountability. It builds
    upon the existing practise of service providers that accredit the networks from
    which sending systems are connecting.</p>"
