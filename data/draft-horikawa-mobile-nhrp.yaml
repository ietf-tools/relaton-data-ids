abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes support for mobile devices using NHRP [1] for
    address resolution in ATM networks. This document proposes some methods for a
    mobile terminal to access its NHS correctly even if it does not know the ATM address
    of the NHS. These proposals involve using 'ATM anycast capability' specified in
    [2] and modification of NHRP to support 'NHRP Register forwarding'. The methods
    described in this document are also applicable to non-mobile devices.</p>"
