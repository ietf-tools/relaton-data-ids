abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal allows host configuration to be split between two different
    DHCP servers, potentially under different administration. This may be useful to
    satisfy specific regulatory, operational or business model requirements. This
    draft proposes two different approaches. In one approach, a DHCP server redirects
    clients to a second DHCP server. In the other, a DHCP server acts as a proxy to
    a second server.</p>"
