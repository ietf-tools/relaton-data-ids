abstract:
- content: "<p>The mechanism described in this document helps to secure an Internet
    Service Provider's router infrastructure from outsider attacks, including (but
    not limited to) Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks based on CPU and/or
    queue exhaustion (e.g., TCP SYN flooding and flooding of invalid MD5-signed routing
    protocol packets.) The presented approach is based on explicitly marking control
    packets from trusted sources by different link-layer encapsulation and does not
    require any modifications to user data exchange protocols, ICMP, routing protocols
    or changes to existing hardware in routers, which allows it to be deployed quickly
    throughout the Internet.</p>"
