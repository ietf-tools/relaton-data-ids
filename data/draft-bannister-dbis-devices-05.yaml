abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described
    in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support ethers and bootparams databases.
    The database schemas SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network Information
    Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved with
    the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510]. An ethers database maps 48-bit
    Ethernet addresses to IP addresses or host names, and bootparams maps hosts to
    boot-time kernel parameters. This document describes LDAP object classes and attributes
    required to extend hosts entries [draft-bannister-dbis-hosts-00] to support parameters
    for ethers and bootparams maps.</p>"
