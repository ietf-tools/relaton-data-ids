abstract:
- content: "<p>From a viewpoint of a layer architecture, a network layer should feature
    a mobility support. Then the users can enjoy their mobility whatever data-link
    devices and user applications they use. Mobile IP has been proposed for a solution
    to provide IP-layer handoffs between subnets served by different Foreign Agents.
    However, it still suffers an interruption of the communications for real-time
    applications.</p>"
