abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanism to enable media stream establishment
    for Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (WebRTC) in the presence of network
    address translators, firewalls and HTTP proxies. HTTP proxy and firewall deployed
    in many private network domains introduce obstacles to the successful establishment
    of media stream via WebRTC. This document examines some of these deployment scenarios
    and specifies requirements on WebRTC enabled web browsers designed to provide
    the best possible chance of media connectivity between WebRTC peers.</p>"
