abstract:
- content: "<p>Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better
    response times and transfer rate by moving the computing towards the edge of the
    network in scenarios like 5G MEC, virtualized central office, etc. Providing services
    by sharing computing resources from multiple edges is emerging. The service nodes
    from multiple edges normally have two key features, service equivalency and service
    dynamics. When the computing resources attached to a single edge site is overloaded,
    static service dispatch can possibly keep allocating the service request to it
    and cause inefficient utilization. The service request to edge computing needs
    to be dispatched to and served by the most suitable edge to improve user experience
    and system utilization by taking both the available computing resources and network
    conditions into account. This draft describes scenarios and requirements of Compute
    First Networking (CFN) to make the computing and network resource to be considered
    in a collaborative way to achieve a more balanced network- based distributed service
    dispatching.</p>"
