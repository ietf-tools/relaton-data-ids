abstract:
- content: "<p>Do Not Disturb (DND) is a commonly used expression for indicating a
    condition where a human user of real-time communications does not wish to be interrupted
    by incoming calls or other forms of communication. This document discusses the
    nature of DND, ways of observing DND, and limitations of and possible improvements
    to DND support in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Rich Presence
    Information Data Format (RPID). This work is being discussed on the bliss@ietf.org
