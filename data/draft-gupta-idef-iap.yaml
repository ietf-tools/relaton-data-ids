- content: "<p>The Intrusion Alert Protocol (IAP) is an application--level protocol
    for exchanging intrusion alert data between intrusion detection elements, notably
    sensor/analyzers and managers in IP networks. The protocol is designed to be independent
    of the type of data representation. The data definition and formatting model for
    alerts is described in companion documents of the working group.</p>"
