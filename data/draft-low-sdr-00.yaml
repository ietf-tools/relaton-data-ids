abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a human-readable, textual syntax for representing
    self-describing structured data. This representation was designed as a transfer
    syntax for loosely-coupled distributed applications where one cannot depend on
    sender(s) and receiver(s) sharing a schema for exchanged data. The syntax is compact,
    expressive, intuitive, and simple to implement.</p>"
