abstract:
- content: "<p>Voucher-Based Addressing is an extensible IPv6 address generation and
    verification methodology for SLAAC-enabled local networks. Individual link-layer
    identifiers are bound to sets of deterministic output IP addresses. Neighbor Discovery
    Link Voucher options distributed with Router Advertisement or Redirect messages
    form a shared consensus between neighbors of the parameters used to auto- generate
    interface addresses. Cryptographic key derivation functions are used to generate
    pseudo-random addresses and to intentionally stretch address computation times.
    Host-selected parameters can be used to derive any number of both stable and ephemeral,
    privacy- focused addresses for each on-link prefix and at the link-local scope.
    Neighbors can then verify the link-layer-to-IP bindings during NDP address resolution
    processes to prevent active neighbor spoofing attacks in local networks.</p>"
