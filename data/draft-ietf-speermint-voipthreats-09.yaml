abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session PEERing for Multimedia INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) working
    group (WG) provides a peering framework that leverages the building blocks of
    existing IETF-defined protocols such as SIP and ENUM for the interconnection between
    SIP Service Providers (SSPs). The objective of this document is to identify and
    enumerate SPEERMINT- specific threat vectors and to give guidance for implementers
    on selecting appropriate countermeasures. Security requirements for SPEERMINT
    that have been derived from the threats detailed in this document can be found
    in RFC 6271; this document provides concrete countermeasures to meet those SPEERMINT
    security requirements. In this document, the different security threats related
    to SPEERMINT are classified into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), the Location
    Routing Function (LRF), the Signaling Function (SF), and the Media Function (MF)
    of a specific SIP Service Provider. Various instances of the threats are briefly
    introduced inside the classification. Finally, existing security solutions for
    SIP and RTP/RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) are presented to describe
    countermeasures currently available for such threats. Each SSP may have connections
    to one or more remote SSPs through peering or transit contracts. A potentially
    compromised remote SSP that attacks other SSPs is out of the scope of this document;
    this document focuses on attacks on an SSP from outside the trust domain such
    an SSP may have with other SSPs. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
