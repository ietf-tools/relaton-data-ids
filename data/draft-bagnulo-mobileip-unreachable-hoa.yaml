abstract:
- content: "<p>This note proposes a modification to the MIPv6 specification in order
    to allow the preservation of established communications when the path between
    the MN and the CN through the HoA becomes unavailable. The proposed modification
    essentially consists on allowing the extension of BCE lifetime upon the reception
    of ICMP Destination Unreachable message as reply to a Binding Refresh Request
    (BRR) message.</p>"
