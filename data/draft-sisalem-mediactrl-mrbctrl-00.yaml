abstract:
- content: "<p>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently working on an architecture
    for controlling media services. As part of the MediaCtrl architecture the Media
    Resource Broker (MRB) was identified as the component needed for intelligent,
    application level media service selection based on non-static signaling properties.
    This document defines the mechanisms needed by the media servers to publish their
    capabilities and the mechanisms needed by the MRB to monitor the status of the
    media servers.</p>"
