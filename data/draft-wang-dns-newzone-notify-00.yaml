abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the NEWZONE_NOTIFY opcode for DNS, by which a primary
    master server advises a set of slave servers that there are zones that has been
    created and that queries should be initiated to discover the new zone data. This
    draft also specifies a mechanism for the slave servers to achieve authenticated
    synchronization of zone data as well as zone synchronization information with
    the primary when zones are created on the primary.</p>"
