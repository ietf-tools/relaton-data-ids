- content: "<p>Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars
    has one-way delays 4-24 minutes) and intermittent communications, mainly because
    of orbital dynamics. This document lists operational methods to enable local DNS
    name resolving on celestial body networks such that there are no real-time query
    and response flow to the authoritative name servers on (Earth) Internet.</p>"
