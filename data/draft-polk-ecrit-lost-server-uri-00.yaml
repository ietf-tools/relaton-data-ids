abstract:
- content: "<p>A Location-to-Service Translation protocol (LoST) Server is used to
    resolve or map a given location with an appropriate Public Safety Answering Point
    (PSAP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for that location. This query is conceivably
    performed on two occasions: prior to making an emergency call, and during an emergency
    call. This document specifies a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) header,
    returned in a SIP Registration transaction, indicating to a SIP user agent the
    appropriate LoST Server's URI to send this query to.</p>"
