abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS connections can be run over various transports, and can in turn
    carry many application protocols. All current transports and at least some application
    protocols are capable of running between symmetric end points, in what could be
    called peer-to-peer mode, but the use of TLS introduces a requirement to always
    assign a client and server role. This specification defines a TLS Extension to
    remedy that stringency of TLS.</p>"
