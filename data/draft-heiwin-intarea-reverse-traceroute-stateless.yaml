abstract:
- content: "<p>Only very few troubleshooting tools exist, that universally work on
    the public internet. Ping and traceroute are the ones that are most frequently
    used, when issues arise that are outside the user's administrative reach. Both
    perform quite basic checks. Ping can only confirm basic reachability of an interface.
    Traceroute can enumerate routers in the forward direction of a path but remains
    blind to the reverse path. In this memo, ICMP extensions are defined, that allow
    to build a reverse traceroute tool for the public internet without having to store
    state on the host performing the actual reverse traceroute operation.</p>"
