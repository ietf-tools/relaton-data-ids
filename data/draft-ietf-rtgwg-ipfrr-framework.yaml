abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast-
    reroute mechanisms that provide protection against link or router failure by invoking
    locally determined repair paths. Unlike MPLS fast-reroute, the mechanisms are
    applicable to a network employing conventional IP routing and forwarding. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
