abstract:
- content: "<p>For the purposes of this document, lawful intercept is the lawfully
    authorized interception and monitoring of communications. Service providers are
    being asked to meet legal and regulatory requirements for the interception of
    voice as well as data communications in IP networks in a variety of countries
    worldwide. Although requirements vary from country to country, some requirements
    remain common even though details such as delivery formats may differ. This document
    describes Cisco's Architecture for supporting lawful intercept in IP networks.
    It provides a general solution that has a minimum set of common interfaces. This
    document does not attempt to address any of the specific legal requirements or
    obligations that may exist in a particular country. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
