abstract:
- content: "<p>The initial version of the Open Web Authentication Protocol (OAuth
    1.0), often referred to as the community addition, included an mechanism for putting
    a digital signature (when using asymmetric keys) or a keyed message digest (when
    using symmetric keys) to a resource request when presenting the OAuth token. This
    cryptographic mechanism has lead to lots of discussions, particularly about the
    problems implementers had, the use cases it supports, and the benefit-cost tradeoff.
    This document tries to describe the use of the so-called 'OAuth Signature' mechamism
    in an unbiased and less emotional way with the main purpose to conclude the discussions.</p>"
