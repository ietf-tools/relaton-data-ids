abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is built upon the foundation
    provided by the Root Server System -- that is, the critical infrastructure that
    serves the DNS root zone. Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production testbed
    that provides an environment where technical and operational experiments can safely
    be performed without risk to production infrastructure. This testbed has been
    used by a broad community of participants to perform experiments that aim to inform
    operations and future development of the production DNS. Yeti DNS is an independently-coordinated
    project and is not affiliated with ICANN, IANA or any Root Server Operator. The
    Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes various novel and experimental components
    including IPv6-only transport, independent, autonomous Zone Signing Key management,
    large cryptographic keys and a large number of Yeti-Root Servers. These differences
    from the Root Server System have operational consequences such as large responses
    to priming queries and the coordination of a large pool of independent operators;
    by deploying such a system globally but outside the production DNS system, the
    Yeti DNS project provides an opportunity to gain insight into those consequences
    without threatening the stability of the DNS. This document neither addresses
    the relevant policies under which the Root Server System is operated nor makes
    any proposal for changing any aspect of its implementation or operation. This
    document aims solely to document the technical and operational experience of deploying
    a system which is similar to but different from the Root Server System.</p>"
