abstract:
- content: "<p>A Geopriv sighting protocol is described that is used for retrieving
    location information from a server within an access network. The protocol includes
    options for retrieving location information either by-value or by-reference. The
    protocol supports mobile and nomadic devices through Location URIs and location
    update URIs, which enables generation of location information at the Device. The
    protocol is an application-layer protocol that is independent of session-layer;
    an HTTP, web services binding is specified.</p>"
