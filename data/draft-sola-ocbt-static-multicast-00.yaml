abstract:
- content: "<p>OCBT is a CBT-based multicast protocol that allows multiple cores for
    a multicast group. The goal in OCBT is to set up and mantain a unique bidirectional
    multicast tree connecting members with cores, and also cores among themselves.
    This tree is used to deliver multicast traffic to members of the multicast group.
    To accomplish that objective, members, non-member senders, routers with members
    and cores must know the IP unicast address of cores and the IP multicast address
    for the multicast group. This is a key issue in tree-based multicast protocols
    using centers, cores, or rendevous points, and their main source of lack of scalability.
    In OCBT this key issue is open. In this Internet-Draft we proposed to use Static
    Multicast as an scalable solution to this problem.</p>"
