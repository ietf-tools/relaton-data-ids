abstract:
- content: "<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, STD 94 == RFC 8949)
    is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
    code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version
    negotiation. CBOR diagnostic notation (EDN) is widely used to represent CBOR data
    items in a way that is accessible to humans, for instance for examples in a specification.
    Complex examples often use nested maps, the map keys (labels) for each of which
    are often sourced from different specifications. While the e'' application extension
    provides a way to import data items, particularly constant values, from a CDDL
    model, it does not help with automatically selecting the right kind of map depending
    on its position in the nested maps. // The present document is intended to capture
    ideas initially // discussed at the CBOR WG interim 2025-06-25 and demonstrate
    some // design alternatives. It is not ready for adoption yet in any way.</p>"
