abstract:
- content: "<p>Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between users
    in near real-time. These messages are usually, but not required to be, short.
    IMs are often used in a conversational mode, that is, the transfer of messages
    back and forth is fast enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.
    Each message can be sent independently using the SIP MESSAGE method, or messages
    can be associated into sessions that are initiated using SIP. The first approach
    is often referred to as pager-mode messaging, due to its similarity to the behavior
    of two way pager devices. The second approach is often called session-mode messaging,
    or simply message sessions. This document describes a message session mechanism
    based on the Common Presence and Instant Messaging message format.</p>"
