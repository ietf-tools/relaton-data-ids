abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast services such as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
    (eMBMS) become more and more popular in mobile networks. In mobile transport network,
    it is important for the operators to provide efficient transport of multicast
    services with existing network devices. This document describes a mechanism of
    using point- to-point Pseudowires (PW) [RFC3985] to achieve efficient layer 2
    multicast transportation in mobile transport networks.The document gives a multicast
    method by utilizing a Point-to-Point (P2P) path between nodes in a packet transport
    network , according to the destination IP address. With it, the PTN nodes can
    replicate and forward the service message, which are received from the multicast
    server, to the plurality of multicast clients corresponding to the destination
    IP address.</p>"
