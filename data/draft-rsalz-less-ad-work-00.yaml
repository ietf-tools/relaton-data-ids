abstract:
- content: "<p>Anecdotally, every IESG complains about the Area Director (AD) workload,
    and says that it takes the first full term to understand the job. Empirically,
    the AD workload is high sometimes causing backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts
    and stressing the ADs. Empirically, the AD workload is high sometimes causing
    backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts and stressing the ADs. This is evidenced
    by the limits applied to the number of pages on the regular IESG telechats, and
    by the number of documents waiting in excess of fifty days for initial AD review
    after a working group has requested publication. This document proposes a number
    of ways that the AD workload can be reduced. It will be up to the IETF consensus
    process to determine which proposals to adopt. A major goal of this effort is
    to make it feasible for a wider diversity of people to volunteer as candidates
    for AD possitions by reducing the barriers and costs to individuals and their
    employers.</p>"
