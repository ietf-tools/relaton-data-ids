abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2181 collected eight independent considerations and created a single
    docuement to address each of them in turn. Over the following two decades it has
    become clear that each of these items should be considered and evovolve in its
    own right, as suggested in RFC 2181. This document extracts the exact text from
    RFC 2181 and places it into its own track.</p>"
