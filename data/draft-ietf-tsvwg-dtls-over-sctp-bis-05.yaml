abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) protocol to protect user messages sent over the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP). It is an improved alternative to the existing RFC 6083. DTLS
    over SCTP provides mutual authentication, confidentiality, integrity protection,
    and replay protection for applications that use SCTP as their transport protocol
    and allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed
    to give communications privacy and to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering
    or message forgery. Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport
    features provided by SCTP and its extensions. This document is an improved alternative
    to RFC 6083 and removes the 16 kB limitation on protected user message size by
    defining a secure user message fragmentation so that multiple DTLS records can
    be used to protect a single user message. It further contains a large number of
    security fixes and improvements. It updates the DTLS versions and SCTP-AUTH HMAC
    algorithms to use. It mitigates reflection attacks of data and control chunks
    and replay attacks of data chunks. It simplifies secure implementation by some
    stricter requirements on the establishment procedures as well as rekeying to align
    with zero trust principles.</p>"
