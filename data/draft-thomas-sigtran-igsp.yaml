abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol devised by Nortel Networks for call
    signalling between gateway call processing entities in a public network offering
    Voice over IP (VoIP) services and interworking with the Switched Circuit Network
    (SCN). The protocol takes account of the requirement to carry ISUP and other Switched
    Circuit Network protocols across the network in a transparent fashion while also
    carrying informa- tion uniquely required for call processing within the VoIP network.
    The current draft applies only to calls using the VoIP network to pass from one
    SCN to another, but the protocol may be extended to more general application.</p>"
