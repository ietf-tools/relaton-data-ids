abstract:
- content: "<p>In Network virtualization (NV) technology, Virtual Network Embedding
    (VNE) is an algorithm used to map a virtual network to the substrate network.
    VNE is the core orientation of NV which has a great impact on the performance
    of virtual network and resource utilization of the substrate network. An efficient
    embedding algorithm can maximize the acceptance ratio of virtual networks to increase
    the revenue for Internet service provider. Several works have been appeared on
    the design of VNE solutions, however, it has becomes a challenging issues for
    researchers. To solved the VNE problem, we believe that reinforcement learning
    (RL) can play a vital role to make the VNE algorithm more intelligent and efficient.
    Moreover, RL has been merged with deep learning techniques to develop adaptive
    models with effective strategies for various complex problems. In RL, agents can
    learn desired behaviors (e.g, optimal VNE strategies), and after learning and
    completing training, it can embed the virtual network to the subtract network
    very quickly and efficiently. RL can reduce the complexity of the VNE algorithm,
    however, it is too difficult to apply RL techniques directly to VNE problems and
    need more research study. In this document, we presenting a problem statement
    to motivate the researchers toward the VNE problem using deep reinforcement learning.</p>"
