abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an improved version of INSIGNIA[1][2], which
    is a framework supporting quality of service(QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. INSIGNIA
    is an in-band signaling system, and 'in-band signaling' means the control information
    is carried along with data in IP packets. In this memo we introduce network measurement
    into INSIGNIA, and then this system can highly responsive to changes of performance
    on mobile ad hoc networks.</p>"
