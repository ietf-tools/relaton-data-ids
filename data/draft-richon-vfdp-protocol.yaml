abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of the Versatile File Delivery Protocol is to deliver files
    from few octets up to few hundred gigaoctets over multicast networks. It works
    over UDP and uses IP multicast addresses. VFDP transmissions have been designed
    to be as reliable as possible according to various and strong network constraints,
    either by retransmitting the whole file or by sending only the missing packets
    depending of a return channel existence.</p>"
