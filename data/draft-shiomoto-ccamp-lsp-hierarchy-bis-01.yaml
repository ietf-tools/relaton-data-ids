abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses topics related to hierarchical and stitched
    Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
    It describes extensions to allow an egress to identify that a bi-directional LSP
    will be used as a dynamically signaled Forwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) or Routing
    Adjacency (RA). In addition, the document also addresses the issue of how to indicate
    that an LSP should be advertised as a traffic engineering (TE) link into a different
    instance of the IGP and how to identify the instance that should be used.</p>"
