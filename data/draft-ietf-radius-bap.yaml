abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of vendor-specific RADIUS attributes
    designed to support the dynamic control of bandwidth allocation in mul- tilink
    PPP [1]. Attributes are defined that specify whether use of the PPP Bandwidth
    Allocation Protocol [2] is allowed or required on incoming calls, the level of
    line capacity (expressed as a percentage) below which utilization must fall before
    a link is eligible to be dropped, and the length of time (in seconds) that a link
    must be underutilized before it is dropped.</p>"
