abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the high-level functional requirements of an
    abstract format, the Format for Incident information Exchange (FINE), which will
    facilitate the exchange of incident information among computer security incident
    response teams (CSIRTs) and involved parties. A common and well-defined format
    will help in the exchange of incident related information across different administrative
    domains such as organizations, regions, and countries. Implementations of FINE
    will also be useful for reactionary analysis of current threats and support the
    proactive identification of trends that can lead to incident prevention.</p>"
