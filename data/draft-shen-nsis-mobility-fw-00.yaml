abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses several framework issues related to Next Step In
    Signaling (NSIS) and mobility interaction. The first issue is related to handoff
    impact on NSIS operation. We present several general requirements for NSIS and
    mobility, followed by evaluation of how specific approaches using Mobile IP or
    other mechanisms might fit into the picture. Other issues covered include NSIS
    and mobility signaling layering and soft-state management.</p>"
