abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
    consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between Autonomous
    Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS and then use Traffic
    Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets along the paths. Such low-power
    paths can be identified by using the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR)
    ratio as an additional constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)
    algorithm. For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the
    Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans multiple AS
    can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate
    the PWR ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach to
    reduce the power consumption. Since calculating the low-power paths can be computationally
    intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic is also proposed. This heuristic reduces
    the computational complexity but may provide a sub-optimal low-power path. The
    feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset
    of the Internet. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power
    reduction require minimal modifications to the existing features of the Internet.
    The proposed techniques can be extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy,
    such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable modifications. The addition to this draft
    is that the power source of the Autonomous system is broken down to a ratio called
    PWR- SOURCE Ratio and used in the arrival of the metric to be used for this purpose.</p>"
