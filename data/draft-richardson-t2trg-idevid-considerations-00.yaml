abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a toxonomy of methods by manufacturers of silicon
    and devices secure private keys and public trust anchors. This deals with two
    related activities: how trust anchors and private keys are installed into devices
    during manufacturer, and how the related manufacturer held private keys are secured
    against disclosure. This document does not evaluate the different mechanisms,
    but rather just serves to name them in a consistent manner in order to aid in
    communication. RFCEDITOR: please remove this paragraph. This work is occuring
    in https://github.com/mcr/idevid-security-considerations</p>"
