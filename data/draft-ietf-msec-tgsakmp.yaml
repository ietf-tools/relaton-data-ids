abstract:
- content: "<p>The Tunneled Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol (T-GSAKMP)
    provides a security framework for creating cryptographic groups on a network.
    It is designed to provide key distribution services under the cryptographic protection
    of a pairwise SA, like IPSec. T-GSAKMP relies on the pairwise SA to provide data
    confidentiality services for policy, DoS mitigation services, and protection from
    'man-in-the-middle' attacks. It provides mechanisms to disseminate group security
    policy, perform access control based upon PKI certificates, generate group keys,
    and recover from compromise. This framework addresses group scalability issues
    by facilitating delegation of process-intensive actions in a secure and controlled
    manner.</p>"
