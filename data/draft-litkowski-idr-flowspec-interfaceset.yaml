abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of traffic flow specification rules. The primary application of this extension
    is DDoS mitigation where the flowspec rules are applied in most cases to all peering
    routers of the network. This document will present another use case of BGP Flow-spec
    where flow specifications are used to maintain some access control lists at network
    boundary. BGP Flowspec is a very efficient distributing machinery that can help
    in saving OPEX while deploying/updating ACLs. This new application requires flow
    specification rules to be applied only on a specific subset of interfaces and
    in a specific direction. The current specification of BGP Flow-spec does not detail
    where the flow specification rules need to be applied. This document presents
    a new interface-set flowspec action that will be used in complement of other actions
    (marking, rate-limiting ...). The purpose of this extension is to inform remote
    routers on where to apply the flow specification. This extension can also be used
    in a DDoS mitigation context where a provider wants to apply the filtering only
    on specific peers.</p>"
