abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an IANA registry that maps country codes to secure
    telephone identity (STIR) root certificates authorized to create signing certificates
    for telephone numbers under the authority of a given country. Some countries allow
    carriers to block unsolicited, automatically generated nuisance calls commonly
    known as 'robocalls.' The use of signed STIR tokens in the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) may be useful in such scenarios to provide positive attestations
    as to call origin. Legacy telephone numbering resources are administrated by national
    policy. Unlike the market-driven use case of Web commerce, some nations may restrict
    the list of STIR root certificate authorities acceptable for issuing signing certificates
    for STIR tokens that provide attestations for their local legacy telephone numbering
    resources. The registry described in this document enables call recipients in
    a first country to validate that signaling it receives from a caller with a telephone
    number claiming to be in a second country conforms to the second country's policy
    of (1) having a limited list of STIR root certificate authorities (or not) and
    (2) the certificate that produced the signature over the signaling is signed by
    one of those authorized STIR root certificate authorities.</p>"
