abstract:
- content: "<p>REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer signaling
    protocol that can be used to maintain an overlay network, and to store data in
    and retrieve data from the overlay. This document defines a new topology plug-in
    for RELOAD that is more appropriate for real world large scale overlays. This
    topology plug-in implements three important functionalities that allow RELOAD
    to operate under real world constraints. First, it includes a load balancing algorithm
    that specifies efficient allocation of load to different nodes in the network.
    Second, the document describes robust techniques for stabilization of fingers
    and successors and specifies self tuning mechanisms that allow dynamic and automatic
    adjustment of parameters needed for these advanced techniques in the topology
    plug-in. Finally, it specifies a locality aware finger selection algorithm that
    reduces average lookup latency.</p>"
