- content: "<p>This specification provides a way for an ephemeral or transactional
    OAuth 2.0 client to signal to the AS that the client does not need or expect to
    have an identified state outside the existence of any issued access and refresh
    tokens. The specification also enables a client to push its registration information
    to the AS during a pushed authorization request.</p>"
