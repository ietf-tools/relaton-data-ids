abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes how WebRTC should handle media codec control
    between peers. With media codec control we mean such parameters as video resolution
    and frame-rate. This includes both initial establishment of capabilities using
    the SDP based JSEP signalling and during ongoing real-time interactive sessions
    in response to user and application events. The solution uses SDP for initial
    boundary establishment that are rarely, if ever changed. During the session the
    RTCP based Codec Operations Point (COP) signaling solution is used for dynamic
    control of parameters enabling timely and responsive controls.</p>"
