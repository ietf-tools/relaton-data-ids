abstract:
- content: "<p>The DECADE Working Group at IETF is working on introducing standard-
    based, application-agnostic in-network storage for content distribution to improve
    both network efficiency and application performance. In this document, we introduce
    content replication trees and then discuss approaches on how a replication tree
    can be constructed in DECADE. In particular, we introduce concepts including core-stateless
    content pull, and stateful, open content forwarding table.</p>"
