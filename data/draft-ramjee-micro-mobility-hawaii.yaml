abstract:
- content: "<p>In this contribution, we present HAWAII: a domain-based approach for
    supporting mobility. HAWAII uses specialized path setup schemes which install
    host-based forwarding entries in specific routers to support intra-domain micro-mobility
    and defaults to using Mobile-IP for inter-domain macro-mobility. These path setup
    schemes deliver excellent performance by reducing mobility related disruption
    to user applications, and by operating locally, reduce the number of mobility
    related updates. Also, in HAWAII, mobile hosts retain their network address while
    moving within the domain, simplifying Quality of Service support. Furthermore,
    reliability is achieved through the use of soft-state forwarding entries for the
    mobile hosts, and the elimination of foreign agents and, in some cases, the home
    agent.</p>"
