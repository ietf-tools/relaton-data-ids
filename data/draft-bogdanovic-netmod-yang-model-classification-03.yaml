abstract:
- content: "<p>The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being considered
    for a wide variety of applications throughout the networking industry at large.
    Many standards organizations and open source projects are using YANG to develop
    and publish models of configuration, state data and operations for a wide variety
    of networking applications. At the same time, there is currently no well-known
    terminology to categorize the various types of YANG models that are being worked
    on. A consistent terminology would help with the categorization of models, assist
    in the analysis the YANG data modeling efforts in the IETF and in other places,
    and bring clarity to the YANG-related discussions between the different groups.
    This document describes a set of concepts and associated terms to support consistent
    classification of YANG models.</p>"
