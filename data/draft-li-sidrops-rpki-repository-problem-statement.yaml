abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread deployment of Route Origin Authorization (ROA)
    and Route Origin Validation (ROV), Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is
    vital for securing inter-domain routing. RPKI uses cryptographic certificates
    to verify the authenticity and authorization of IP address and AS number allocations
    and the certificates are stored in the RPKI Repository. This document conducts
    the data-driven analysis of the RPKI Repository, including a survey of worldwide
    AS administrators and a measurement and analysis of the existing RPKI Repository.
    This document finds that the current RPKI Repository architecture is sensitive
    to failures and lacks of scalability. An attack or downtime of any repository
    Publication Point (PP) will prevent RPs from obtaining complete RPKI object views.
    Furthermore, since the current RPKI Repository is not tamper-resistant, RPKI authorities
    can easily manipulate RPKI objects without consent from subordinate INR holders.
    This document also defines the key requirements for a reliable, scalable, and
    secure RPKI Repository.</p>"
