abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Link State Protocol Data Unit (PDU) flooding rates are much
    slower than what modern networks can support. The use of IS-IS at larger scale
    requires faster flooding rates to achieve desired convergence goals. This document
    discusses the need for faster flooding, the issues around faster flooding, and
    some example approaches to achieve faster flooding. It also defines protocol extensions
    relevant to faster flooding.</p>"
