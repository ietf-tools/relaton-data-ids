abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to analyze the issues that have arisen
    so far and then to propose a set of requirements for the Fixed Mobile Convergence.
    The term Fixed Mobile Convergence spans several scenarios from true integration
    of fixed and mobile terminals, services, and network infrastructure on both technical
    and management level down to pure interworking between fixed and mobile networks
    in serving access for multi-interface terminals like todays' smartphones. In the
    interworking scenario, the mobile network passes on the mobile subscribers policies
    to the fixed broadband network in order to maintain the end-to-end service level
    agreement and to support remote terminal and access network management. Explicitly,
    the fixed broadband network must have partnership with the mobile network in Fixed
    Mobile Convergence interworking scenario. This document gives a brief overview
    of the assumed Fixed Mobile Convergence architecture and related works and then
    introduces several requirements based on the partnership in Fixed Mobile Convergence
    architecture, such as User Equipment identification and authentication, Femto
    Access Point management, device type identification and mobility considerations.</p>"
