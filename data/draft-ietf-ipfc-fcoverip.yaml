abstract:
- content: "<p>Fibre Channel(FC) is a dominant technology used in Storage Area Networks(SAN).
    The purpose of this draft is to specify a standard way of encapsulating FC frames
    over IP and to describe mechanisms that allow islands of FC SANs to be interconnected
    over IP-based networks running over very reliable data links. FC over IP relies
    on IP-based network services to provide the connectivity between the SAN islands
    over LANs, MANs, or WANs. While the FC over IP specification is independent of
    the link level transport protocol, it assumes a high bandwidth, high reliability,
    low loss link level transport such as Gigabit Ethernet, SONET, ATM, or DWDM. This
    specification treats all classes of FC frames the same -- as datagrams.</p>"
