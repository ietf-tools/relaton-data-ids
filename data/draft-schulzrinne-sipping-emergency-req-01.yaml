abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enumerates requirements for emergency calls in VoIP and
    general Internet multimedia systems. We divide the requirements into 'trunk replacement'
    and 'end-to-end'. Trunking solutions only exchange the emergency call center's
    circuit-switched access by an IP-based system. The requirements for end-to-end
    IP-based emergency calling address functional and security issues for determining
    the correct emergency address, for identifying the appropriate emergency call
    center and for identifying the caller and its location. While we focus on systems
    that employ the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), many of the requirements may
    also apply to other environments, such as those using H.248/Megaco, MGCP or H.323.</p>"
