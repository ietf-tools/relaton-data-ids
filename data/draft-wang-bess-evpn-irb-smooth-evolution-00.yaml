abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN IRB has been deployed following [RFC9135]'s early draft for a
    long time. This draft discusses how can these existing deployments smoothly evolved
    into an IP-aliasing ([I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing]) enhanced EVPN symmetric
    IRB scenario, especially when two of an IP-VRF's BDs (whose IRB interfaces are
    attached to the same IP-VRF) have been attched to a common ES before that network
    evolution. In such case, when these two BDs are evolved into IP-aliasing enhanced
    EVPN symmetric IRB as per [I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing] or distributed Bump-in-the-
    wire as per [I-D.wang-bess-evpn-distributed-bump-in-the-wire], the IP A-D per
    EVI routes of these two BDs may conflict with each other in the context of the
    IP-VRF instance.</p>"
