abstract:
- content: "<p>Moving data center closer to end users can provide numerous benefits
    for pre-uploaded content: lower latency, increased robustness of delivery, and
    improved quality of user experience. For these reasons, many Online Storage Service
    Providers(OSSPs),Photos Sharing Service Providers (PSSPs), and Videos Sharing
    Service Providers(VSSPs), etc., are scaling up their infrastructure, and many
    above Upload Service Providers(USPs)are also deploying their own cloud platforms
    to improve data upload rate. It is generally desirable that a given content item
    generated by end users can be quickly and robustly delivered to the destination
    regardless of that end user's location or attachment network. This is the motivation
    for deploying Upload Acceleration Transport Network(UATN) so it can propose an
    open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content from
    end users to the destination(data center or another end user, etc.). However,
    no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate such an upload
    acceleration mechanism. The goal of this document is to explain the proposed UATN
    in detail for providing public upload acceleration service and interconnect existing
    upload acceleration systems as an open content delivery infrastructur.</p>"
