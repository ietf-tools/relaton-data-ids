abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet Draft describes, analyzes, and compares different strategies
    for allocating addresses, in a way that can be generalized for any power-of-two
    sized, binary address space. One such strategy is proposed as being "optimal",
    when viewed from the perspective of space-packing efficiency. This Draft recommends
    use of this technique as a "Best Current Practice", for both IPv4 and IPv6 address
    allocations.Author's Note This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft
    or a related draft(s) being placed on the Informational Track for v6ops. The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
