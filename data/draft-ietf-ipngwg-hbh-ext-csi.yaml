abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new mechanism called 'Connection/Link Status
    Investigation (CSI)'. It is designed to collect status information of nodes along
    the communication path. One new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option (CSI option) and three
    new ICMPv6 messages (Status Request/Reply, and Status Report) are proposed as
    extensions for the CSI mechanism. The CSI mechanism is based on hop-by-hop data
    acquisition operations and realtime 'boomerang' action messages. It is simple
    and can investigate both outgoing and incoming paths between the source and the
    destination with minimum investigation packets. It can provide various new functions
    (e.g. realtime consumed bandwidth measurement, etc.). Since it has good characteristics,
    it is possible to innovate current investigation functions (e.g., 'traceroute',
    'pathchar', etc.) This document describes specifications of the CSI mechanism
    and defines a set of basic data types. The CSI mechanism is designed as a generic
    framework mechanism. By defining new data types to collect, it can be easily applied
    to various advanced usages.</p>"
