abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman
    exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure
    Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.
    The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port
    as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol. ZRTP does not assume
    a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in
    end devices. For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection
    against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol
    provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication. ZRTP can utilize a Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through
    the signaling channel. To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP
    (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles. ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice
    media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using
    an optional digital signature. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
