abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes data structures and API support for Mobile
    IPv6 as an extension to Advanced Socket API support for IPv6. Mobility Support
    in IPv6 introduces mobility protocol header for IPv6. It is expected that future
    Mobile IPv6 applications and implementations may need to access Mobility binding
    messages and Return Routability messages for diagnostic, packet accounting and
    local policy setting purposes. In order to provide portability for Mobile IP applications
    that use sockets under IPv6, standardization is needed for the Mobile IPv6 specific
    APIs.</p>"
