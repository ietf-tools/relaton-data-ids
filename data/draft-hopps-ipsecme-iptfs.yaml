abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to enhance IPsec traffic flow security
    by adding traffic flow confidentiality to encrypted IP encapsulated traffic. Traffic
    flow confidentiality is provided by obscuring the size and frequency of IP traffic
    using a fixed-sized, constant-send-rate IPsec tunnel. The solution allows for
    congestion control as well.</p>"
