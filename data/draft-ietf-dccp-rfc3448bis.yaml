abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). TFRC is a
    congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet
    environment. It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows,
    but has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making
    it more suitable for applications such as streaming media where a relatively smooth
    sending rate is of importance. This document obsoletes RFC 3448 and updates RFC
    4342. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
