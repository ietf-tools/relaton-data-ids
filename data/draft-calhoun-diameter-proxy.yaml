abstract:
- content: "<p>The DIAMETER base protocol [2] allows for secure communication between
    two DIAMETER nodes, and introduces the concept of proxying through the Proxy-State
    AVP. However, the base protocol only allows for hop-by-hop security, and the work
    done in the ROAMOPS WG [8] shows that support for end-to-end security through
    proxies. This document describes the extensions necessary to provide for secure
    communication through DIAMETER proxies.</p>"
