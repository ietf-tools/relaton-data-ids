abstract:
- content: "<p>The possibility of Quantum Computers pose a serious challenge to cryptography
    algorithms deployed widely today. IKEv2 is one example of a cryptosystem that
    could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them at
    a later time when a Quantum Computer is available. It is anticipated that IKEv2
    will be extended to support quantum secure key exchange algorithms; however that
    is not likely to happen in the near term. To address this problem before then,
    this document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a
    Quantum Computer, by using preshared keys.</p>"
