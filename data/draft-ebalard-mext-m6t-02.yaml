abstract:
- content: "<p>MIPv6 [RFC3775] protocol has been designed to work on IPv6 networks:
    nothing was initially provisioned in the specification to support movement of
    Mobile Nodes to IPv4-only networks (with or without NAT) or the communication
    with IPv4 peers. DSMIPv6 [RFC5555] is the official solution specified to address
    those needs. It requires IPv4/NAT-awareness by the MIPv6 module, IKE module and
    IPsec stack. The global approach selected by DSMIPv6 requires changes to implementations
    and increases complexity. This memo presents an alternative approach to support
    operations of MIPv6 mobile nodes from IPv4-only networks. It does not require
    changes to MIPv6 modules, IKE module and IPsec stack.</p>"
