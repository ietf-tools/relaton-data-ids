abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a solution to discover the capabilities of
    a flow-aware service function. The solution relies upon the use of the Port Control
    Protocol (PCP). This solution allows for applications to anticipate connectivity
    failures and to proceed with countermeasures (e.g., create a mapping for incoming
    connections, discover a mapping lifetime, discover an external IP address, avoid
    injecting some options in the outgoing packets, etc.). The propsoed approach allows,
    for example, to discover whether an upstream flow-aware service function is MPTCP-
    friendly (that is, it does not strip MPTCP signals) or SCTP- compliant, whether
    it embeds a firewall function, etc. or a combination thereof.</p>"
