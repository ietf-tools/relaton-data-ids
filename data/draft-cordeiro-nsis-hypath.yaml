abstract:
- content: "<p>In a multi-domain Internet that offers QoS guaranties for applications,
    there is the need of signaling among the domain entities that are responsible
    for the management of QoS. Because different domains have different network protocols
    and topologies, the HyPath approach uses the NSIS protocol and interactions with
    the local routing protocols to have an off-path signaling in hybrid environments.</p>"
