abstract:
- content: "<p>To enhance the reliability, bridged network is normally multi-homed
    to an EVPN network, there are two categories of mechanisms to avoid the layer
    2 traffic loop. The first category does not require the PEs participating in the
    control protocol of the bridged network, while the second category requires that.
    [EVPN] described one of the first category mechanisms called designated forwarder
    (DF) election to achieve loop avoidance and vlan-based load balancing. This draft
    mainly focuses on the second category of mechanisms which can achieve intra-vlan
    MAC-based load balancing. MAC-based VLAN balancing is more applicable than DF
    election mechanism if all end stations in bridged network are on the same VLAN
    which can cause traffic congestion in DF link.</p>"
