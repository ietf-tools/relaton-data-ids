abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extended performance statistics for TCP. They
    are designed to use TCP's ideal vantage point to diagnose performance problems
    in both the network and the application. If a network-based application is performing
    poorly, TCP can determine if the bottleneck is in the sender, the receiver, or
    the network itself. If the bottleneck is in the network, TCP can provide specific
    information about its nature. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
