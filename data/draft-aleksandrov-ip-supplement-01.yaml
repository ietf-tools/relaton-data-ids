abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real Time Network Service (RTNS) is a process of data transfer
    (with real time characteristics) between two end systems. It is part of the OSI
    model of the Network layer. It is not a separate protocol, but rather an additional
    service, of which applications, exchanging data in real time, can take advantage.
    In the current document this service is defined as an option of the Internet Protocol.</p>"
