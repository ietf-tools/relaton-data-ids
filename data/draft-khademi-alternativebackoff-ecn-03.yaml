abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides an experimental update to RFC3168. It updates the
    TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification received via Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN). The updated method reduces cwnd by a smaller amount than TCP
    does in reaction to loss. The intention is to achieve good throughput when the
    queue at the bottleneck is smaller than the bandwidth-delay-product of the connection.
    This is more likely when an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism has used ECN
    to CE-mark a packet, than when a packet was lost. Future versions of this document
    will discuss SCTP as well as other transports using ECN.</p>"
