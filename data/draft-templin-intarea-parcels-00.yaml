abstract:
- content: <p>IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are understood to contain a unit of
    data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss. Upper layer protocols
    such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) prepare data units known as "segments",
    with traditional arrangements including a single segment per packet. This document
    presents a new construct known as the "IP Parcel" which permits a single packet
    to carry multiple segments. The parcel can be opened at middleboxes on the path
    with the included segments broken out into individual packets, then rejoined into
    one or more repackaged parcels to be forwarded further toward the final destination.
    Reordering of segments within parcels is unimportant; what matters is that the
    number of parcels delivered to the final destination should be kept to a minimum,
    and that loss or receipt of individual segments (and not parcel size) determines
    the retransmission unit.</p>
