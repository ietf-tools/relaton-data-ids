abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to put in perspective the use of cryptographic
    algorithms in the Simple Network Monitoring Protocol Version 3 standard. In particular,
    it notes that today's standard is infinitely more secure than previous versions,
    as the previous versions had zero security. It further notes that, as cryptographic
    algorthim developments change over time, we expect that the recommended algorithms
    will change when the security community has reached new consensus.</p>"
