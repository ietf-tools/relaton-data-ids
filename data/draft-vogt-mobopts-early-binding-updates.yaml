abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure use of
    route optimization between unacquainted nodes. The handover latency caused by
    the procedure can significantly impact delay-sensitive applications, however.
    This document presents an optimization to Mobile IPv6 that eliminates the latency.
    The optimization is realized as an optional, and fully backward-compatible, extension
    to Mobile IPv6.</p>"
