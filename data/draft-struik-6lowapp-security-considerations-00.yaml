abstract:
- content: "<p>We discuss security architectural design considerations for general-purpose
    multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The security architecture fits extremely constrained
    wireless environments, such as sensor networks, while remaining uniform and general
    enough to fit any wireless network. The design is tailored towards low overall
    implementation cost, supports semi-automatic lifecycle management, including ease
    of installation and configuration, scalability, survivability, mobility, and is
    adaptable towards network topology changes and towards different trust models
    underlying network operations.</p>"
