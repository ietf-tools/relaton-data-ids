abstract:
- content: "<p>In [Awduche] the MPLS Traffic Engineering control plane was applied
    to the creation of light paths (optical circuits). Due to the general hierarchical
    capabilities of MPLS, and the flexibility of the label switching paradigm the
    same techniques used to apply the MPLS control plane to the optical layer can
    be used to apply it to the SONET/SDH path layer and in fact any form of circuit
    switching. This note discusses advantages of such an approach and some of the
    issues involved in its application.</p>"
