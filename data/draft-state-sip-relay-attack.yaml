abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP [RFC3261]) provides a mechanism
    for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants.
    This document describes a vulnerability of SIP combined with HTTP Digest Access
    Authentication [RFC2617] through which an attacker can leverage the victim's credentials
    to send authenticated requests on his behalf. This attack is different from the
    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and does not require any eavesdropping, DNS or
    IP spoofing.</p>"
