- content: "<p>The SNMPv2 Working Group has accomplished much good work thus far by
    refining and extending the definition of management information, by improving
    protocol operations in several important ways, and by enriching and formalizing
    compliance statements. Improvements in these areas have been discussed and consensus
    has been reached on a set of documents that are ready to be moved forward to Draft
    Standard on the Internet standards track.</p>"
