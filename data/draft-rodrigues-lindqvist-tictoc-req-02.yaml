abstract:
- content: "<p>Distribution of high precision time and frequency over the Internet
    and special purpose IP networks is becoming more and more needed as IP networks
    replace legacy networks and as new applications with need for frequency and time
    are developed on the Internet. The IETF formed the TICTOC working group to address
    the problem and perform an analysis on existing solutions and the needs. This
    document summarizes application needs, as described and agreed on at an TICTOC
    interim meeting held in Paris from June 16 to 18, 2008.</p>"
