abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the results achieved when simulating the timing
    rules of the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based
    Feedback, denoted AVPF. Unicast and multicast topologies are considered as well
    as several protocol and environment configurations. The results show that the
    timing rules result in better performance regarding feedback delay and still preserve
    the well-accepted RTP rules regarding allowed bit rates for control traffic. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
