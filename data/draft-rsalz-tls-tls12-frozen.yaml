abstract:
- content: '<p>TLS 1.2 is in widespread use and can be configured such that it provides
    good security properties. TLS 1.3 is also in widespread use and fixes some known
    deficiencies with TLS 1.2, such as removing error-prone cryptographic primitives
    and encrypting more of the traffic so that it is not readable by outsiders. Both
    versions have several extension points, so items like new cryptographic algorithms,
    new supported groups (formerly "named curves"), etc., can be added without defining
    a new protocol. This document specifies that TLS 1.2 is frozen: no new algorithms
    or extensions will be approved. Further, TLS 1.3 use is widespread, and new protocols
    should require and assume its existence.</p>'
