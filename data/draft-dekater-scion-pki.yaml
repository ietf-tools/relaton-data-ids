abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the trust concept and design of the SCION _Control
    Plane Public Key Infrastructure (CP-PKI)_. SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation
    On Next-generation networks) is a path-aware, inter-domain network architecture
    where the Control Plane PKI handles cryptographic material and lays the foundation
    for the authentication procedures in SCION. It is used by SCION's Control Plane
    to authenticate and verify path information, and provisions SCION's trust model
    based on Isolation Domains. This document describes the trust model behind the
    SCION Control Plane PKI, including specifications of the different types of certificates
    and the Trust Root Configuration. It also specifies how to deploy the Control
    Plane PKI infrastructure. This document contains new approaches to secure path
    aware networking. It is not an Internet Standard, has not received any formal
    review of the IETF, nor was the work developed through the rough consensus process.
    The approaches offered in this work are offered to the community for its consideration
    in the further evolution of the Internet.</p>"
