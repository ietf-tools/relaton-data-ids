abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS cookies, as specified in RFC 7873, are a lightweight DNS transaction
    security mechanism that provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients
    against a variety of denial-of-service and amplification, forgery, or cache poisoning
    attacks by off-path attackers. This document provides precise directions for creating
    Server Cookies so that an anycast server set including diverse implementations
    will interoperate with standard clients. This document updates [RFC7873]</p>"
