abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized MultiProtocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of protocol
    specifications has been defined to provide support for different technologies
    as well as different applications. These include support for requesting TDM connections
    based on Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH)
    as well as Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document concentrates on the
    signaling aspects of the GMPLS suite of protocols, specifically GMPLS signaling
    using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE). It proposes
    additional extensions to these signaling protocols to support the capabilities
    of an ASON network. This document proposes appropriate extensions towards the
    resolution of additional requirements identified and communicated by the ITU-T
    Study Group 15 in support of ITU's ASON standardization effort. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
