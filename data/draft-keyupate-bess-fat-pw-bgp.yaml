abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC6391] describes a mechanism that uses an additional label (Flow
    Label) in the MPLS label stack that allows Label Switch Routers to balance flows
    within Pseudowires at a finer granularity than the individual Pseudowires across
    the Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs) that exists within the Packet Switched Network
    (PSN). Furthermore,[RFC6391] defines the LDP protocol extensions required to synchronize
    the flow label states between the ingress and egress PEs when using the signaling
    procedures defined in the [RFC4447]. This draft defines protocol extensions required
    to synchronize flow label states among PEs when using the BGP-based signaling
    procedures defined in [RFC4761]. These protocol extensions are equally applicable
    to point-to-point L2VPNs defined in [RFC6624].</p>"
