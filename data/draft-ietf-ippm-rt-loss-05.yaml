abstract:
- content: "<p>Many user applications (and the transport protocols that make them
    possible) require two-way communications. To assess this capability, and to achieve
    test system simplicity, round-trip loss measurements are frequently conducted
    in practice. The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes
    a round-trip loss measurement capability for the Internet. However, there is currently
    no round-trip packet loss metric specified according to the RFC 2330 framework.
    This memo adds round-trip loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics (IPPM). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
