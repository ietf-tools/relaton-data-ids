abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier
    2 (CCID 2), TCP-like Congestion Control, in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    (DCCP). CCID 2 should be used by senders who would like to take advantage of the
    available bandwidth in an environment with rapidly changing conditions, and who
    are able to adapt to the abrupt changes in the congestion window typical of TCP's
    Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) congestion control. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
