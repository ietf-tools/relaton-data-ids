abstract:
- content: "<p>In the 802.16 Per-MS interface prefix model, one prefix can only be
    assigned to one interface of a mobile station by an access router and different
    mobile stations can't share a prefix. Managing Per-MS interface prefixes is likely
    to increase the processing load at the access router. Based on the idea that DHCPv6
    servers can manage prefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in
    which the access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes
    to an DHCPv6 server. The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming
    mobile station to the DHCPv6 server. The access router next advertises the prefix
    information to the mobile station with a Router Advertisement message. When the
    mobile station hands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. We also
    describe how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation.</p>"
