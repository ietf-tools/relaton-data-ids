abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet-Draft provides the description of problem set faced by
    NFS and its various side band protocols when implemented over IPv4 and IPv6 networks
    in various deployment scenarios. Solution to the various problems are also given
    in the draft and are sought for approval in the respective NFS and side band protocol
    versions. Foreword This "forward" section is an unnumbered section that is not
    included in the table of contents. It is primarily used for the IESG to make comments
    about the document. It can also be used for comments about the status of the document
    and sometimes is used for the RFC2119 requirements language statement.</p>
