abstract:
- content: "<p>The Group Security Policy Token is a structure used to specify the
    security policy and configurable parameters for a cryptographic group, such as
    a secure multicast group. Because the security of a group is composed of the totality
    of multiple security services, mechanisms, and attributes throughout the communications
    infrastructure, an authenticatable representation of the features that must be
    supported throughout the system is needed to ensure consistent security. This
    document specifies the structure of such a token. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
