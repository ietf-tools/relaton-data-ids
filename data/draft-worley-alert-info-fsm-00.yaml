abstract:
- content: <p>The "alert" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used in
    the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and
    responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the characteristics of the
    call that the user agent has originated or terminated. Based on the URNs in the
    Alert-Info header field, the user agent must select an the best available signal
    to present to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call. This document
    describes a method of constructing a finite state machine (FSM) to do this selection.
    In many situations, the resulting FSM is simpler and faster than previously described
    selection algorithms. The designer must construct the FSM so that its behavior
    will satisfy the requirements given in the definition of the "alert" URN namespace.</p>
