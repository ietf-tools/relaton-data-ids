abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end-
    systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by different
    ISPs. While this scenario is certainly becoming increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile
    devices), currently most end- systems are single-homed (e.g. desktop PCs in an
    enterprise). It seems also likely that a lot of network sites will insist on having
    all traffic pass a single network element (e.g. for security reasons) before traffic
    is split across multiple paths. This memo therefore describes mechanisms to make
    multiple paths available to multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available
    directly at the end-systems but somewhere within the network.</p>"
