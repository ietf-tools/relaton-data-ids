abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents extensions to the Whois protocol output format
    which enables a possibility for the server to send referal information to the
    Whois client. This referal mechanism can be used for example in a situation with
    a registrar/registry model, where the registrars all have their own Whois databases,
    and together they serve a whole TLD. It can also be used when implementing a root-whois
    service on top of all whois servers in the world, and this way enable the possibility
    of creating advanced proxy services. For the latter, a registration procedure
    is also suggested, where Whois services can be registered. Discussion on this
    Internet-Draft is to be held on the mailing list ietf-whois-ext@imc.org, which
    is hosted by the Internet Mail Consortium. To subscribe, send an email to ietf-whois-ext-request@imc.org,
    with the text 'subscribe' as the only word in the body of the mail. There is an
