abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is written to aid the process of selecting and completing
    the definition of the MIDCOM protocol, which will operate between MIDCOM Agents
    and Middleboxes such as firewalls and NATs. It describes the semantics which the
    protocol must support. These semantics are derived from the MIDCOM requirements
    and the MIDCOM usage scenarios which helped to inspire the requirements. This
    is intended to be a working document of the IETF Middlebox Communications (MIDCOM)
    Working Group.</p>"
