abstract:
- content: "<p>For the authenticity of the mapping origin of IPv4 address block in
    IPv6-only networks, this document defines a standard profile for Mapping Origin
    Authorizations (MOAs). MOA is a cryptographically signed object that provides
    a means of verifying that the holder of a set of IPv4 prefixes has authorized
    an IPv6 mapping prefix to originate mapping for those prefixes. When receiving
    the MOA objects from the relying parties, PE devices can verify and discard invalid
    address mapping announcements from unauthorized IPv6 mapping prefixes to prevent
    IPv4 prefix hijacking.</p>"
