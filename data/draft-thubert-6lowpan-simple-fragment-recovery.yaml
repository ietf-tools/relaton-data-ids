abstract:
- content: "<p>Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an
    802.15.4 frame can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst case, a packet
    might end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.
    If a single one of those fragments is lost in transmission, all fragments must
    be resent, further contributing to the congestion that might have caused the initial
    packet loss. This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward and recover individual
    fragments that might be lost over multiple hops between 6LoWPAN endpoints.</p>"
