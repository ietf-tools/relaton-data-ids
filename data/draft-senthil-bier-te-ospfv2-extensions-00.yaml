abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER-TE: Traffic Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)
    is a variant of BIER [RFC8279] to support explicit path engineering. BIER-TE defines
    a (loose) source routed multicast forwarding method where every hop and destination
    in the TE path is identified via bits in the bitstring of the BIER header in the
    data packets. BIER-TE forwarding architecture is described in [I-D.draft- ietf-bier-te-arch].
    Control framework for Traffic Engineering with BIER-TE forwarding plane is explained
    in [I-D.draft-eckert-teas-bier- te-framework]. This document describes the OSPF
    [RFC2328] protocol extension required for BIER-TE control framework with MPLS
    encapsulation [RFC8296]. Support for other encapsulation types is outside the
    scope of this document. The use of multiple encapsulation types is outside the
    scope of this document.</p>"
