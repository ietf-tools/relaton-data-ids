abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the solution to optimize the multicast tunneling
    in mobile IPv4. This solution will not break the basic bi- directional tunneling
    multicast solution of MIPv4. A new multicast foreign agent works as a proxy node
    for multiple mobile nodes within one limit scope. Single tunnel is set up between
    one home agent and one mobile foreign agent for single multicast stream. A new
    notification message is created for the communication between home agent and multicast
    foreign agent. There is no modification on mobile nodes.</p>"
