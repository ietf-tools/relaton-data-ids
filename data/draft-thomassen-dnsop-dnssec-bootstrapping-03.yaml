abstract:
- content: '<p>This document introduces an in-band method for DNS operators to publish
    arbitrary information about the zones they are authoritative for, in an authenticated
    fashion and on a per-zone basis. The mechanism allows managed DNS operators to
    securely announce DNSSEC key parameters for zones under their management, including
    for zones that are not currently securely delegated. Whenever DS records are absent
    for a zone''s delegation, this signal enables the parent''s registry or registrar
    to cryptographically validate the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the child''s apex.
    The parent can then provision DS records for the delegation without resorting
    to out-of-band validation or weaker types of cross-checks such as "Accept after
    Delay" ([RFC8078]). This document updates [RFC8078] and replaces its Section 3
    with Section 3.2 of this document. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([])
    is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general
    musings, etc. They will be removed before publication. This document is being
