abstract:
- content: "<p>Handoff in IP mobility protocols involves moving a mobile node's Layer
    3 routing reachability point from one access router to another, before or after
    the mobile node has established a Layer 2 connection with the radio access point
    that is covered by the new access router. In addition, other context information
    about the mobile node's IP service may be transferred from the old access router
    to the new one, in order to minimize the service disruption during the handoff
    process. While the exact details of how this is accomplished vary depending on
    the IP mobility and seamless handoff protocols, one common thread required for
    IP-level handoffs is discovering the candidate access routers for the mobile node's
    handoff. Discovering the candidate access router involves identifying its IP address
    as well as its capabilities that the mobile node might be interested in. At the
    time of IP-level handoff, if a collection of candidates is identified, an algorithm
    is run to determine the target access router for the mobile node's handoff. This
    document describes the problem of candidate access router discovery. The document
    does not discuss the algorithm by which the actual target access router is selected,
    nor how the handoff to the target is achieved.</p>"
