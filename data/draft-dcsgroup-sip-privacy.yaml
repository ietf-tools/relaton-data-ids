abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) [4]. The extensions allow callers and callees to maintain their privacy
    in an environment where one or more proxies serve as intermediaries which can
    provide the identity of the parties either directly or indirectly. The extensions
    allow the parties to be identified either by name or by type the latter of which
    can be used to identify some group of callers and callees.</p>"
