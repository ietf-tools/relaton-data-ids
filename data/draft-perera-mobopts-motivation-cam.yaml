- content: "<p>This document describes the motivation for investigating the definition
    and architectural implications of defining what a “context” is for mobility management
    purposes. This draft seeks to generate enough interest on this topic in the working
    group. If there is sufficient interest on this topic, drafts that address methodologies
    to enable context aware mobility could be proposed.</p>"
