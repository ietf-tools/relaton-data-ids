abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths between end-
    systems. These are typically provided by using different IP addresses obtained
    by different ISPs at the end-systems. While this scenario is certainly becoming
    increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile devices), currently most end-systems are single-homed
    (e.g. desktop PCs in an enterprise). It seems also likely that a lot of network
    sites will insist on having all traffic pass a single network element (e.g. for
    security reasons) before traffic is split across multiple paths. This memo therefore
    describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to multipath TCP-capable
    end-systems that are not available directly at the end-systems but somewhere within
    the network.</p>"
