abstract:
- content: "<p>Delivery status notifications (DSNs) are critical to the correct operation
    of an email system. However, the existing Draft Standards (RFC 3461, RFC 3462,
    RFC 3464) are presently limited to US-ASCII text in the machine-readable portions
    of the protocol. This specification adds a new address type for international
    email addresses so an original recipient address with non-US-ASCII characters
    can be correctly preserved even after downgrading. This also provides updated
    content return media types for delivery status notifications and message disposition
    notifications to support use of the new address type. This document experimentally
    extends RFC 3461, RFC 3464, and RFC 3798.</p>"
