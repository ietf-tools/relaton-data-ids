abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is written to help coordinate work on pre-congestion
    notification (PCN) between the IETF PCN Working Group and the ITU-T. It maps the
    use of PCN into the ITU-T transport control architecture. It examines three scenarios,
    showing in each, where new requirements are placed on the ITU-T architecture.
    In each case, the ITU-T functional entity known as the Transport Resource Control
    Functional Entity (TRC-FE) is seen as the logical destination for PCN congestion
    reports and PCN flow termination reports, which it uses to keep track of network
    status. As logical entities, instances of the TRC-FE can be present in the ingress
    nodes, in one or more centralized devices, or in both. These alternatives define
    the scenarios examined.</p>"
