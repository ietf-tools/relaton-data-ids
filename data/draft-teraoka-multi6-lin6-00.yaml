abstract:
- content: "<p>LIN6 is a protocol supporting multihoming and mobility in IPv6. LIN6
    introduces the node id, not the interface id, for each node. Each node can be
    identified by its node id no matter where the node is connected and no matter
    how many interfaces the node has. In the IPv6 layer, 64-bit node id called LIN6
    ID is used while 128-bit node-id called LIN6 generalized ID is used above the
    Transport layer. TCP connections and security associations can be preserved even
    if the node moves to another subnet or the node changes the using interface in
    a multihoming environment without modifying TCP or IPsec. In comparison with Mobile
    IPv6, LIN6 has several advantages in terms of header overhead and fault tolerance.</p>"
