abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification proposes an update to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, to
    enhance the operation of IPv6 over wireless links that exhibit lossy multicast
    support, and enable a large degree of scalability by splitting the broadcast domains.
    A broadcast-efficient backbone running classical IPv6 Neighbor Discovery federates
    multiple wireless links to form a large MultiLink Subnet, but the broadcast domain
    does not need to extend to the wireless links for the purpose of ND operation.
    Backbone Routers placed at the wireless edge of the backbone proxy the ND operation
    and route packets from/to registered nodes, and wireless nodes register or are
    proxy-registered to the Backbone Router to setup proxy services in a fashion that
    is essentially similar to a classical Layer-2 association.</p>"
