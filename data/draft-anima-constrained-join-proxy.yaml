abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a protocol to securely assign a pledge to a domain,
    represented by a Registrar, using an intermediary node between pledge and Registrar.
    This intermediary node is known as a "constrained Join Proxy". This document extends
    the work of [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] by replacing the Circuit-
    proxy by a stateless/stateful constrained (CoAP) Join Proxy. It transports join
    traffic from the pledge to the Registrar without requiring per-client state.</p>
