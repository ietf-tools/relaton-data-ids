abstract:
- content: "<p>Definition and operation of variant domain names are differ from zone
    administrators, and there is no generic rules, therefore, in general, it is hard
    to guess variant labels for end users and / or applications. Meanwhile, zone administrators
    are understanding all variant labels list because they generate variant labels
    and activate them according to rules they defined. Thus, if there is a mechanism
    that end users and / or applications can obtain variant labels list from zone
    administrators, then it would be useful. The Variant Labels Resource Record (VL
    RR) provides such variant labels list for that purpose.</p>"
