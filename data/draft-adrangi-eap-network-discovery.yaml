abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in RFC 3748.
    This document defines a mechanism that allows an access network to provide identity
    selection hints to an EAP peer -- the end of the link that responds to the authenticator.
    The purpose is to assist the EAP peer in selecting an appropriate Network Access
    Identifier (NAI). This is useful in situations where the peer does not receive
    a lower-layer indication of what network it is connecting to, or when there is
    no direct roaming relationship between the access network and the peer's home
    network. In the latter case, authentication is typically accomplished via a mediating
    network such as a roaming consortium or broker. The mechanism defined in this
    document is limited in its scalability. It is intended for access networks that
    have a small to moderate number of direct roaming partners. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
