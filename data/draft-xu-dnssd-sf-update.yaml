abstract:
- content: "<p>In a Service Function Chaining (SFC)-enabled domain, the Domain Name
    System (DNS) can be used as a mechanism for Service Function (SF) auto-discovery
    [I-D.xu-dnssd-sf-discovery]. Since the information associated with SF instances
    (e.g., capacity and current load) would change dynamically, the information associated
    with SF instances which is stored in the DNS sever needs to be updated accordingly.
    This document describes how to use the DNS UPDATE mechanism [RFC2136] to dynamically
    update the corresponding Resource Records (RRs) for SF instances.</p>"
