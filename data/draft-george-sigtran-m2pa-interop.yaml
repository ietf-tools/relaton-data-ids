- content: "<p>This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRAN
    mailing list and at M2PA Interoperability Tests. This document will be updated
    after each interoperability test to include any new issues. Two basic sets of
    problems are identified by this draft: (1) issues that need to be addressed in
    the next revision of the M2PA draft, and (2) issues that were found that are strictly
    implementation problems.</p>"
