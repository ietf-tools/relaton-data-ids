abstract:
- content: "<p>The IESG prefers to avoid having RFCs linger in Proposed Standard Status.
    In general, RFCs which have demonstratable interoperability and usefulness should
    become Draft Standards, and eventually may become full Standards, as described
    in RFC 2026 [1] section 6.2. When a Proposed Standard RFC is reissued to become
    Draft, corrections, clarifications and other changes can be integrated into the
    update. However, if changes to the protocol are 'very significant', then the document
    needs to be issued as Proposed Standard again. This document describes an approach
    to reissue the core RFCs which describe LDAPv3, all of which are currently at
    Proposed Standard status. It also summarizes the status of other existing and
    upcoming standards-track LDAP RFCs.</p>"
