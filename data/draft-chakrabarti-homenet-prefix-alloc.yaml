abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern IPv4 home networks are often configured with multi-level of
    NATs and Residential gateways to separate islands of networks used for different
    purposes. With the introduction of IPv6 home networks we'd like to be able to
    maintain the same topological freedom as we have with IPv4 but without requiring
    any IPv6 NATs. This document specifies the topological restrictions for what we
    term Basic Home Networks and specifies how DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation can be used
    to autoconfigure IPv6 address prefixes in such networks.</p>"
