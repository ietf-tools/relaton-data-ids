abstract:
- content: "<p>Multimedia Internet Keying - MIKEY - is a key management scheme that
    can be used for real-time applications. In particular, it has been defined focusing
    on the support of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol. MIKEY itself defines
    four key distribution schemes. Moreover, it is defined to allow extensions of
    the protocol. As MIKEY becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the base
    protocol arose, especially in terms of additional key distribution schemes, but
    also in terms of payload enhancements. This document provides an overview about
    MIKEY in general as well as the existing extensions in MIKEY, which have been
    defined or are in the process of definition.</p>"
