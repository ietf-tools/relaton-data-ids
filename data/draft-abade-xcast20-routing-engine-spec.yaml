abstract:
- content: <p>XCAST6 (Explicit Multiunicast on IPv6) is a new protocol defined in
    RFC 5058. In XCAST, the list of destinations is explicitly encoded within the
    data packets instead of using a multicast group address. Research is currently
    ongoing on two versions of XCAST6 and this document describes the design and implementation
    of a routing engine for the new version in which the use of hop-by-hop options
    header has been eliminated. This draft explains why there is a need for an XCAST6
    routing engine, highlights the requirements for its implementation, the design
    process and how to eventually implement the routing engine to allow for deployment
    of XCAST6 protocol. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST
    NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [RFC2119].</p>
