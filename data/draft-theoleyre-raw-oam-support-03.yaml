abstract:
- content: "<p>Some critical applications may use a wireless infrastructure. However,
    wireless networks exhibit a bandwidth of several orders of magnitude lower than
    wired networks. Besides, wireless transmissions are lossy by nature; the probability
    that a packet cannot be decoded correctly by the receiver may be quite high. In
    these conditions, guaranteeing the network infrastructure works properly is particularly
    challenging, since we need to address some issues specific to wireless networks.
    This document lists the requirements of the Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) features recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure
    on top of a collection of wireless segments. This document describes the benefits,
    problems, and trade-offs for using OAM in wireless networks to achieve Service
    Level Objectives (SLO).</p>"
