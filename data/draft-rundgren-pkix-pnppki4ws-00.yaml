abstract:
- content: "<p>'Web Services' [2, 3] is the collective name of a set of emerging technologies
    targeted for ultimately supporting Plug-and-Play (PnP) integration of business-
    and information-systems, within and between organizations. This specification
    covers an X.509 certificate extension, designed to enable PnP-support for the
    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) part of a Web Service. In addition to supporting
    Web Services, the extension is also intended to be useable for general-purpose
    PKI-enabled applications. A PowerPoint presentation highlighting the core of this
    specification is also available [4]</p>"
