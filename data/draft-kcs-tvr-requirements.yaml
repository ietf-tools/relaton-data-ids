abstract:
- content: "<p>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) involves calculating a path, or subpath
    within a network, taking into account the timing of message transmission or receipt
    as an integral part of the overall route computation. The results of a TVR computation
    are influenced by the specific time at which the path is needed, and the computation
    is performed without any discernible alterations to the network topology or other
    cost functions associated with the route. This document introduces requirements
    for TVR computations to improve network communication and resource efficiency.</p>"
