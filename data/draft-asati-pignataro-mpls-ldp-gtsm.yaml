abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) describes a generalized
    use of a packets Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) to verify that
    the packet was sourced by a node on a connected link, thereby protecting the router's
    IP control-plane from CPU utilization based attacks. This technique improves security
    and is used by many protocols. This document defines the GTSM use for Label Distribution
    Protocol (LDP).</p>"
