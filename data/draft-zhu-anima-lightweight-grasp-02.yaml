abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the UDP-based Lightweight GeneRic Autonomic
    Signaling Protocol (LW-GRASP), which is designed to be a lightweight version of
    the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol(GRASP, or the standard GRASP), with shortened
    messages and a built-in reliability mechanism. LW-GRASP can work reliably over
    UDP, making it suitable for IoT, where lightweight and resource-constrained devices
    dominate. Given the established ecosystem of CoAP and aiming to promote LW- GRASP
    adoption in IoT, this document also focuses on the LW-GRASP transition from UDP
    to a CoAP-based framework, i.e., LW-GRASP over CoAP. Furthermore, this document
    also discusses the potential way to adapt the LW-GRASP to work on the network
    without IP connectivity.</p>"
