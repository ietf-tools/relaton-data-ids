abstract:
- content: "<p>A handover process on Mobile IPv6 requires a time period referred as
    handoff latency. This latency is not acceptable to support real-time application.
    We propose a new smooth handoff method using the Explicit Multicast (xcast) technique.
    On the wired section, control/user packets are multicasted by Xcast scheme to
    the Base Stations where Mobile Node (MN) can receive, and then packets are passed
    to the air-link activated between a BS and the MN. This procedure provides mobility
    in heterogeneous media environment because this handoff mechanism is basically
    able to implemented without additional control or intelligence of neither intermediate
    routers.</p>"
