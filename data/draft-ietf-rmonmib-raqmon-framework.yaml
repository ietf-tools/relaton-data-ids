abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to monitor end-devices such as IP phones, pagers, Instant
    Messaging clients, mobile phones, and various other handheld computing devices.
    This memo extends the remote network monitoring (RMON) family of specifications
    to allow real-time quality-of-service (QoS) monitoring of various applications
    that run on these devices and allows this information to be integrated with the
    RMON family using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This memo defines
    the framework, architecture, relevant metrics, and transport requirements for
    real-time QoS monitoring of applications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
