abstract:
- content: "<p>With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based interactive services
    such as cloud gaming have gained substantial attention. To ensure users' quality
    of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive service may require not only high bandwidth
    (e.g., high-resolution media transmission) but also low delay (e.g., low latency
    and low lagging). However, the quality perceived by a user of a mobile and wireless
    device may vary widely as a function of many factors, and unhandled changes can
    substantially compromise the user's QoE. In this document, we investigate network-aware
    applications (NAA), which realize cloud-based interactive services with improved
    QoE, by efficient utilization of a solution named Mobile and Wireless Information
    Exposure (MoWIE). In particular, this document demonstrates, through realistic
    evaluations, that mobile network information such as MCS (Modulation and Coding
    Scheme) can effectively expose the dynamics of the underlying network and can
    be made available to applications through MoWIE; using such an information, the
    applications can then adapt key control knobs such as media codec schemes, encapsulation,
    and application layer processing to minimize QoE distortion. Following evaluations
    we give a cursory overview of the design space for implementing MoWIE</p>"
