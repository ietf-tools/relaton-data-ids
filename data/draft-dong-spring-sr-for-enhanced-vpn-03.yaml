abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN technology to enable it
    to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require better isolation from both control
    and data plane's perspective and have more stringent performance requirements
    than can be provided with overlay VPNs. The characteristics of an enhanced VPN
    as perceived by its tenant needs to be comparable to those of a dedicated private
    network. This requires tight integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay
    network resources in a scalable manner. An enhanced VPN may form the underpinning
    of 5G network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right. This document
    describes the use of segment routing based mechanisms to provide the enhanced
    VPN service with dedicated network resources. The proposed mechanism is applicable
    to both SR with MPLS data plane and SR with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
