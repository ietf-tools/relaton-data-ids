abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IP Identification (IPID) field
    used for fragmentation and reassembly. In practice, this field was commonly used
    by network diagnosticians for tracking packets. In IPv6, the IPID has been moved
    to the Fragment header, and would only be used when fragmentation is required.
    Thus, the IPID field in IPv6, is no longer able to be utilized in the valuable
    role it played in IPv4, relative to diagnostics and problem resolution. This causes
    great concern in particular for end users and large enterprises, for whom Network/Application
    availability and performance can directly and profoundly affect bottom line financials.
    Several viable solutions to this situation exist. One potential solution is included
    in later sections of this RFC, but the primary intention of this RFC is to initiate
    action by the IETF on this issue, perhaps in the form of a Working Group Subcommittee.</p>"
