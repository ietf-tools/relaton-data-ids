abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes FAST TCP, a modification to the TCP congestion
    control algorithm for high-speed long-distance networks. The AIMD congestion control
    algorithm in the current TCP has equilibrium and dynamic problems that become
    more and more severe as bandwidth-delay product increases. FAST TCP uses feedback
    information, in addition to packet loss, to address these problems in order to
    stabilize a network around a fair and efficient operating point..</p>"
