abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores architectural considerations for using encapsulation
    in support of stack evolution and new transport protocol deployment in an increasingly
    encrypted Internet. These architectural considerations are based on an idealized
    architecture where all interactions among applications, endpoints, and the path
    occur explicitly, with this cooperation enforced cryptographically. This idealized
    architecture is then lensed through the state of devices in the present Internet
    and how they would impair the deployability of such an architecture, in order
    to support an incremental deployment of this approach.</p>"
