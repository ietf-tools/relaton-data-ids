abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a packetization scheme for MPEG video and audio
    streams. The scheme proposed can be used to transport such a video or audio flow
    over the protocols used by RTP. Two profiles are described. The first is designed
    to support maximum interoperability with MPEG-2 Systems environments. The second
    is designed to maximize simplicity of implementation and to leverage other efforts
    within IETF.</p>"
