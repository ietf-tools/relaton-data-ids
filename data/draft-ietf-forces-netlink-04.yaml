abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Linux Netlink, which is used in Linux both
    as an intra-kernel messaging system as well as between kernel and user space.
    The focus of this document is to describe Netlink's functionality as a protocol
    between a Forwarding Engine Component (FEC) and a Control Plane Component (CPC),
    the two components that define an IP service. As a result of this focus, this
    document ignores other uses of Netlink, including its use as a intra-kernel messaging
    system, as an inter- process communication scheme (IPC), or as a configuration
    tool for other non-networking or non-IP network services (such as decnet, etc.).
    This document is intended as informational in the context of prior art for the
    ForCES IETF working group. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
