abstract:
- content: "<p>Industrial networks pose unique challenges in realizing a communication
    substrate on the shop floor. Such challenges are due to strict Quality of Service
    (QoS) requirements, a wide range of protocols for data exchange, and highly heterogeneous
    network infrastructures. In this regard, this document proposes a framework for
    QoS-enabled semantic routing in industrial networks. Such a framework aims at
    providing loosely-coupled, asynchronous communications, fine-grained traffic management
    (delivery semantics and flow priorities), and in-network traffic optimization.</p>"
