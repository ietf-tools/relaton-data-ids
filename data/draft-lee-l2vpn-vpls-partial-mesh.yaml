abstract:
- content: "<p>Some standard network devices may not be able to communicate with each
    other as if they were connected to a common LAN segment in the event of partial
    mesh connectivity in a VPLS. Unless this problem is addressed, the deployment
    of VPLS may eventually be limited to sites not using link state routing or bridges.</p>"
