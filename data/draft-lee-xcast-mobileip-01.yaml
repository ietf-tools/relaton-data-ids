abstract:
- content: "<p>As a special kind of Internet multicast, Explicit multicast(Xcast)[1]
    encodes destination addresses of all the receivers into the packet. Not requiring
    membership management and routing information exchange in the intermediate routers
    in contrast to the legacy Internet multicast or Deering multicast, Xcast can effectively
    provide multicast service to Internet without those overheads. A node mobility
    supporting protocol, Mobile IP[2,3], requires to be modified to appropriately
    intercept, route and forward Xcast packets. This document specifies the protocol
    operations for the mobile agent, the mobile node and the correspondent node to
    support transmission and reception of Xcast datagram over Mobile IPv4 and Mobile
    IPv6.</p>"
