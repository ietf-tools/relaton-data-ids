abstract:
- content: "<p>Massive datasets continue to be acquired, simulated, processed and
    analyzed by globally distributed scientific collaborations, and the volume of
    this data is growing exponentially. These datasets need to be exchanged through
    a global network infrastructure. Applications that manages the transfer of such
    massive data volumes can benefit substantially from the utilization of network
    information, and more directly from network-resident services that optimize and
    load balance network usage among multiple transfer requests, and coordinate the
    network use with the use of other resources such as computing and storage. The
    Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol can provide via extensions
    such network information, to both users and proactive network management services
    where applicable, with the goal of improving both application performance and
    network resource utilization, leading to greater overall efficiency of the science
    programs' workflows. This document introduces an Exascale Dataset Transfer Orchestrator
    (EDTO), which is a data transfer scheduling service for exascale science networks.
    EDTO provides simple APIs for users to submit, update and delete data transfer
    requests and to monitor the status of each transfer, along with local and global
    network and site state information in real-time. EDTO collects network information
    from multiple ALTO services utilizing proposed topology extensions and leverages
    emerging SDN control capabilities to orchestrate the scheduling of multiple large
    dataset transfers, leading to improved data transfer latency and reliability as
    well as more efficient utilization of limited network resources.</p>"
