abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Bitstream Transport over Ethernet (BToE), a method
    for capturing and transporting raw Layer 1 bitstream data across Ethernet Layer
    2 networks. Unlike traditional frame-based transport mechanisms, BToE enables
    fully transparent transmission of physical layer signals, allowing for cable fault
    isolation, ASIC/FPGA debugging, and transceiver validation by preserving the integrity
    of all bits, including those outside valid Ethernet frames.</p>"
