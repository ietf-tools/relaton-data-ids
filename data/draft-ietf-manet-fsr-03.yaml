abstract:
- content: "<p>The Fisheye State Routing (FSR) algorithm for ad hoc networks introduces
    the notion of multi-level 'scope' to reduce routing update overhead in large networks.
    A node stores the Link State for every destination in the network. It periodically
    broadcasts the Link State update of a destination to its neighbors with a frequency
    that depends on the hop distance to that destination (i.e., the 'scope' relative
    to that destination). State updates corresponding to far away destinations are
    propagated with lower frequency than those for close by destinations. From state
    updates, nodes construct the topology map of the entire network and compute efficient
    routes. The route on which the packet travels becomes progressively more accurate
    as the packet approaches its destination. FSR resembles Link State routing in
    that it propagates Link State updates. However, the updates are propagated as
    aggregates, periodically (with period dependent on distance) instead of being
    flooded individually from each source. FSR leads to major reduction in link O/H
    caused by routing table updates. It enhances scalability of large, mobile ad hoc
    networks.</p>"
