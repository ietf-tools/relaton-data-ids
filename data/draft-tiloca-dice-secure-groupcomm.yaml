abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP has emerged as the de-facto IoT standard for communication involving
    resource-constrained devices composing Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). CoAP
    mandates the adoption of the DTLS protocol to secure unicast communication. However,
    in several IoT application scenarios involving a group of multiple devices, the
    adoption of CoAP multicast communication through IPv6 results in a number of advantages,
    especially in terms of performance and scalability. Yet, CoAP does not specify
    how to secure multicast group communication in an interoperable way. This draft
    presents a method to secure communication in a multicast group, through an adaptation
    of the DTLS record layer. In particular, group members rely on the same group
    keying material in order to secure both request messages sent via multicast and
    possible unicast messages sent as response. Since the group keying material is
    provided upon joining the group, all group members are not required to perform
    any DTLS handshake with each other. The proposed method makes it possible to provide
    either group authentication or source authentication of secured messages.</p>"
