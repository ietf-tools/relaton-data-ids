abstract:
- content: <p>A wide array of information is being carried (or proposed to be carried)
    through BGP peering sessions. While this information is necessary and valid, BGP
    was not designed to carry blobs of information, but rather network layer reachability
    and information related directly to forwarding traffic from peer to peer. This
    document proposes a new BGP message type with a well defined structure to use
    BGP peering sessions for information passed from provider to provider along edge
    peering points, the BGP based Generic transPort (bgpBGP). This message type is
    designed to allow any pair of BGP speakers to transfer information within an existing
    session, or for BGP peering semantics to be used with multihop sessions between
    "information exchange speakers" within an autonomous system. The new message type
    is designed to provide flexibility by allowing the encoding of virtually any information
    within a BGP session through the use of type-length-vector formatting.</p>
