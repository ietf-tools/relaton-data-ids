abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes two methods for using Kerberos [KRB5] for authentication
    and key exchange in the Secure Shell protocol. The first method uses Kerberos
    as a means to authenticate the Diffie-Hellman exchange described in [SSH-TRANSPORT].
    The second method uses Kerberos for authentication and key-exchange. This memo
    also defines a new user authentication method which allows an authorization name
    and optional credentials to build upon the underlying authenticated key exchange.</p>"
