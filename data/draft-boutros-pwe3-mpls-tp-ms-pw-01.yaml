abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing procedures for concatenating static and dynamic pseudowires
    (PWs) do not take into account the PW status Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) messages defined for static PW. Also, these procedures do not take into
    account operator functions such Lock Instruct and Loopback introduced as part
    of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). This informational document reiterates stitching
    procedures for static PW taking into account all the new proposed extensions.
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) /
    International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network.</p>"
