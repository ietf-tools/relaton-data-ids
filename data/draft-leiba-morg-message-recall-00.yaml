abstract:
- content: "<p>End users occasionally send email messages that they later want to
    recall, perhaps because they sent incorrect information, or had second thoughts
    about what they said in the message. Proprietary email systems often provide such
    a recall function. This document specifies a standard mechanism for providing
    it with Internet email. Note A revised version of this draft document will be
    submitted to the RFC editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.
    Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to
    morg@ietf.org.</p>"
