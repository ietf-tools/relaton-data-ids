- content: "<p>This document introduces global elements into the SIP Conference Event
    Package XML schema to make the conference objects and sub- objects easily accessible
    by schemas external to the event package, such as the XCON conference control
    protocols. This document also defines the way to introduce XCON extensions into
    the SIP Conference Event Package in a backwards compatible manner. This document
    also defines a set of extensions to the SIP Conference Event Package XML schema
    being used in the XCON conferencing architecture.</p>"
