abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an architecture for IPv6 access networks that
    decouples the network-layer concepts of Links, Interface, and Subnets from the
    link-layer concepts of links, ports, and broadcast domains, and limits the reliance
    on link-layer broadcasts. This architecture is suitable for IPv6 over any network,
    including non-broadcast networks, which is typically the case for intangible media
    such as wireless and overlays. A study of the issues with IPv6 ND over intangible
    media is presented, and a framework to solve those issues within the new architecture
    is proposed.</p>"
