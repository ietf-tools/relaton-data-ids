abstract:
- content: '<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a RESTful transfer protocol
    for constrained nodes and networks. Basic CoAP messages work well for small payloads
    from sensors and actuators; however, applications will need to transfer larger
    payloads occasionally -- for instance, for firmware updates. In contrast to HTTP,
    where TCP does the grunt work of segmenting and resequencing, CoAP is based on
    datagram transports such as UDP or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). These
    transports only offer fragmentation, which is even more problematic in constrained
    nodes and networks, limiting the maximum size of resource representations that
    can practically be transferred. Instead of relying on IP fragmentation, this specification
    extends basic CoAP with a pair of "Block" options for transferring multiple blocks
    of information from a resource representation in multiple request-response pairs.
    In many important cases, the Block options enable a server to be truly stateless:
    the server can handle each block transfer separately, with no need for a connection
    setup or other server-side memory of previous block transfers. Essentially, the
    Block options provide a minimal way to transfer larger representations in a block-wise
    fashion. A CoAP implementation that does not support these options generally is
    limited in the size of the representations that can be exchanged, so there is
    an expectation that the Block options will be widely used in CoAP implementations.
    Therefore, this specification updates RFC 7252.</p>'
