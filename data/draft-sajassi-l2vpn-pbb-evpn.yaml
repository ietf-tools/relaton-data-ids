abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging [802.1ah]
    can be combined with E-VPN in order to reduce the number of BGP MAC advertisement
    routes by aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-MAC) addresses via Provider Backbone
    MAC address (B-MAC), provide client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation
    and B-MAC sub- netting, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows,
    offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology changes.
    The combined solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN. Conventions</p>"
