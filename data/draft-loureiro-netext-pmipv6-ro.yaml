abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 as protocol for network-based
    mobility management. In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are attached to the network
    through Mobility Access Gateways and registered with a Local Mobility Anchor.
    Traffic from and to the mobile node traverses the mobile node's Local Mobility
    Anchor, irrespective of the location of the mobile node's corresponding communication
    endpoint. This document specifies a protocol extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 which
    allows the set up and maintenance of a localized routing path between two communicating
    mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways without traversing the mobile nodes' Local
    Mobility Anchor(s). The protocol component of a rendezvous control point ensures
    stable maintenance of routing states during handover in scenarios with multiple
    mobility anchors, where states for the two communication endpoints are distributed
    between these anchors.</p>"
