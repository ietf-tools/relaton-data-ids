abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides a general framework for the use of assertions
    as client credentials and/or authorization grants with OAuth 2.0. It includes
    a generic mechanism for transporting assertions during interactions with a token
    endpoint, as wells as rules for the content and processing of those assertions.
    The intent is to provide an enhanced security profile by using derived values
    such as signatures or HMACs, as well as facilitate the use of OAuth 2.0 in client-server
    integration scenarios where the end-user may not be present. This specification
    only defines abstract messsage flow and assertion content. Actual use requires
    implementation of a companion protocol binding specification. Additional profile
    documents provide standard representations in formats such as SAML and JWT.</p>"
