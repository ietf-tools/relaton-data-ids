abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning network related information
    in order to allow applications to make network informed decisions. The present
    draft extends the ALTO cost information so as to broaden the decision possibilities
    of applications to not only decide 'where' to connect to, but also 'when'. This
    is useful to applications that need to schedule their data transfers and connections
    and have a degree of freedom to do so. ALTO guidance to schedule application traffic
    can also efficiently help for load balancing and resources efficiency. Besides,
    the ALTO Cost Calendar allows to schedule the ALTO requests themselves and thus
    to save a number of ALTO transactions. This draft proposes new capabilities and
    attributes on filtered cost maps and endpoint costs enabling an ALTO Server to
    provide "Cost Calendars". These capabilities are applicable to time-sensitive
    ALTO metrics. With ALTO Cost Calendars, an ALTO Server exposes ALTO Cost Values
    in JSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval. The time
    intervals as well as other Calendar attributes are specified in the IRD and ALTO
    Server responses.</p>
