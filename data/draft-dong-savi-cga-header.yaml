abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an IPv6 extension header called the Cryptographically
    Generated Address (CGA) Extension Header. The CGA Extension Header holds the CGA
    parameters associated with the source CGA of an IPv6 packet. This information
    can be used to validate that a particular packet was sent by the node associated
    with a specific CGA, enabling secure IPv6 address-based access control mechanisms.</p>"
