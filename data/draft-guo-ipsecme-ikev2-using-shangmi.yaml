abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a set of cryptographic transforms for using in
    the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2). The transforms are based
    on Chinese cryptographic standard algorithms (called "ShangMi" or “SM” algorithms).
    The use of these algorithms with IKEv2 is not endorsed by the IETF. The SM algorithms
    are mandatory in China, so this document provides a description of how to use
    the SM algorithms with IKEv2 and specifies a set of cryptographic transforms so
    that implementers can produce interworking implementations.</p>
