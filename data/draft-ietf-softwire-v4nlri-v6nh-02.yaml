abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of network-layer
    protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong is determined
    by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI). The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only have
    provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol
    when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4
    NLRI. This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising IPv4
    NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.
    This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of
    the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol,
    the encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of the protocols the
    address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to
    dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with
    an IPv6 Next Hop. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
