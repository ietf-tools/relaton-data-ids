abstract:
- content: "<p>Where the payload carried over a pseudowire carries a number of identifiable
    flows it can in some circumstances be desirable to carry those flows over the
    equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist in the packet switched network. Most
    forwarding engines are able to hash based on label stacks and use this to balance
    flows over ECMPs. This draft describes a method of identifying the flows, or flow
    groups, to the label switched routers by including an additional label in the
    label stack.</p>"
