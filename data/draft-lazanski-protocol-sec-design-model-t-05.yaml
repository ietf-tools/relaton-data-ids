abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a non-exhaustive set of considerations for protocol
    designers and implementers with regards to attack defence. This document follows
    on from the way forward outlined in draft-lazanski- users-threat-model-t-04. These
    considerations both supplement and support the work on threat models. They can
    be used as an aid to analyse protocol design choice and in turn to help combat
    threats and defend users of these protocols and systems against malicious attacks.
    First, we list well-known classes of attacks that pose threats, with relevant
    case studies and descriptions. Next, we give a list of defence measures against
    these attacks to be considered when designing and deploying protocols. Naturally,
    deployments of protocols vary greatly between use cases; therefore, some attacks
    and defensive measures outlined may require more consideration than others, dependent
    on use case. This RFC can be used by protocol designers to write the Security
    Considerations section in an RFC. The impact on attack defence of a protocol should
    be considered in multiple use cases across the multiple layers of the internet.
    Defence against malicious attacks can be improved and it can be weakened by design
    features of protocols. Designers should acknowledge the role of protocols in attack
    prevention, detection and mitigation; this document aims to be a useful guide
    in doing so.</p>"
