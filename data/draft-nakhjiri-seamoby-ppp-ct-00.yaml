abstract:
- content: "<p>Many of todayâ€™s networks use PPP as a means of providing access links
    to remote users. In case a PPP user is mobile and performs a subnet handover,
    it needs to tear down and re-establish of its PPP link with the network. PPP link
    re-establishment is an elaborate procedure (as explained in a later section of
    this document) involving multiple messages. This will lead in an extended service
    disruption as due to the round trip time involved in the messaging as well extensive
    radio bandwidth usage. Of this reason, we consider PPP to be a prime candidate
    for context transfer [1-3]. The proposal in this document can reduce the number
    of PPP establishment messages by 50%-100. Furthermore, it will save significant
    amount of time in PPP state machine transitions, due to the multiphase nature
    of PPP. Reliability and timing issues of PPP context transfer are also discussed.</p>"
