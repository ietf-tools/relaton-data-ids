abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methods for DNS resolvers to self-publish information
    about themselves. The information is returned as a JSON object. The names in this
    object are defined in an IANA registry that allows for light-weight registration.
    Applications and operating systems can use the methods defined here to get the
    information from resolvers in order to make choices about how to send future queries
    to those resolvers.</p>"
