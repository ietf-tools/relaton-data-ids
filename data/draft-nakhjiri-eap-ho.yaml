abstract:
- content: "<p>The current EAP documentation set, such as [EAP3748], [EAPKEY6], and
    [RADEAP3579] provide a powerful framework for performing combined authentication
    and key management using an EAP server and an AAA infrastructure. The framework
    competently deals with many issues related to network-access control and link
    security setup. However, when it comes to deploying these specifications for mobile
    wireless environments, where a peer is required to perform fast and/or heterogeneous
    handovers, the current framework can be extended with more clear guidelines and
    possibly specifications in ways that prevent interoperability or security issues.
    This draft intends to explore some of the complications in deploying the EAP framework
    for handovers and analyze a few solution alternatives. Further threat analysis
    of each alternative or providing trade-off guidelines for support of handover
    may be part of the future revisions of this document.</p>"
