abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a link state routing protocol used for IP-network topology
    discovery using different types of Link State Advertisements. The resulting Link
    State Database (LSDB) is used to compute IP address forwarding table based on
    shortest-path criteria. OSPF has been extended to support Traffic Engineering,
    QoS in packet and non-packet networks. These has been a serious concern regarding
    scalability and convergence of information in large networks. This memo documents
    an optional OSPF capability to support TE only functionality. This OSPF TE Only
    option is to support existing and future Traffic Engineering extensions for packet
    and/or non-packet networks with out exchanging any hop-by-hop routing information.
    This is accomplished by exchanging T-bit option in OSPF Hello packets. This gives
    flexibility of supporting larger TE areas, increased scalability and improved
    convergence.</p>"
