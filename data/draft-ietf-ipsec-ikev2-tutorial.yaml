abstract:
- content: "<p>The main job of a protocol specification is to document how the protocol
    works. It is sometimes difficult to learn how a protocol works from such a document,
    because there are so many details, and the necessary formalism for accuracy makes
    a specification long and intimidating to read. What also is usually lost in the
    process of creating an RFC for a protocol is documentation of the tradeoffs that
    were considered when making controversial choices. Sometimes it is possible to
    find this information on the email archives, but that is a daunting task. This
    document is intended to work both as a tutorial to understanding IKEv2, and a
    summary of the controversial issues, with the reasoning on all sides of each issue.
    If any differences in details exist between this document and the IKEv2 specification,
    the IKEv2 specification is authoritative. This document is intended only to make
    the IKEv2 specification more understandable on the first reading, as well as documenting
    reasoning behind decisions.</p>"
