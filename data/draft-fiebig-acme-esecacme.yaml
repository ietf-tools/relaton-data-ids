abstract:
- content: "<p>By now, most Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates are
    issued via the ACME protocol. Recently, several attacks against domain validation
    (DV) have been published, including IP-use-after- free, (forced) on-path attacks,
    and attacks on protocols used for validation. In general, these attacks can be
    mitigated by (selectively) requirering additional challenges, e.g., DNS validation,
    proof of prior-key-ownership, or in severe cases even extended validation (EV)
    instead of DV. This document provides a list of critical cases and describes which
    mitigations can be used to reduce the threat of issuing a certificate to an unauthorized
    party.</p>"
