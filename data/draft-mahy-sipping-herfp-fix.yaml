abstract:
- content: <p>The SIP protocol defines a role for proxy servers which can forward
    requests to multiple contacts associated with a specific resource or person. While
    each of these contacts is expected to send a response of some kind, responses
    for each branch are not necessarily sent back to the original requester. The proxy
    server forwards only the "best" final response back to the original request. This
    behavior causes a situation known as the Herterogeneous Error Response Forking
    Problem (HERFP) in which the original requester has no opportunity to see or fix
    a variety of potentially repairable errors. This document describes a backwards
    compatible solution to the HERFP problem for INVITE transactions.</p>
