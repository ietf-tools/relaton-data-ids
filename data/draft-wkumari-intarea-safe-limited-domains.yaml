abstract:
- content: <p>There is a trend towards documents describing protocols that are only
    intended to be used within "limited domains". Unfortunately, these drafts often
    do not clearly define how the boundary of the limited domain is established and
    enforced, or require that operators of these limited domains //perfectly// implement
    filters to protect the rest of the Internet from these protocols. In addition,
    these protocols sometimes require that networks that are outside of (and unaffiliated
    with) the limited domain explicitly implement filters in order to protect their
    networks if these protocols leak outside of the limited domain. This document
    discusses the concepts of "fail-open" versus "fail- closed" protocols and limited
    domains, and provides a mechanism for designing limited domain protocols that
    are safer to deploy.</p>
