abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how users can find and communicate with each
    other privately when using end-to-end encryption messaging. Users can retrieve
    the key materials and message delivery endpoints of other users without revealing
    their social graphs to the key material service hosts. Users can search for phone
    numbers or user IDs, either individually or in batches, using private information
    retrieval (PIR). Our specification is based on the state-of-the-art lattice-based
    homomorphic PIR scheme, which provides a reasonable tradeoff between privacy and
    cost in a keyword-based sparse PIR setting.</p>"
