abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides guidance on the design of methods to avoid congestion
    collapse and to provide congestion control. Recommendations and requirements on
    this topic are distributed across many documents in the RFC series. This therefore
    seeks to gather and consolidate these recommendations and provide overall guidance.
    It is intended to provide input to the design of new congestion control methods
    in protocols, such as the IETF Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) transport.
    The present document is for discussion and comment by the IETF. If published,
    it plans to update or replace the Best Current Practice in BCP 41, which currently
    includes "Congestion Control Principles" provided in RFC2914.</p>
