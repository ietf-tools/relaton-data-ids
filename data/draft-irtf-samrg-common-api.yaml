abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors and
    technical implementations at different protocol layers. Multicast data distribution
    is most efficiently performed on the lowest available layer, but a heterogeneous
    deployment status of multicast technologies throughout the Internet requires an
    adaptive service binding at runtime. Today, it is difficult to write an application
    that runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most efficient multicast
    service available in the network. Facing robustness requirements, developers are
    frequently forced to use a stable upper-layer protocol provided by the application
    itself. This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for transparent
    communication in underlay and overlay and that grants access to the different
    flavors of multicast. It proposes an abstract naming scheme that uses multicast
    URIs, and it discusses mapping mechanisms between different namespaces and distribution
    technologies. Additionally, this document describes the application of this API
    for building gateways that interconnect current Multicast Domains throughout the
    Internet. It reports on an implementation of the programming Interface, including
    service middleware. This document is a product of the Scalable Adaptive Multicast
    (SAM) Research Group.</p>"
