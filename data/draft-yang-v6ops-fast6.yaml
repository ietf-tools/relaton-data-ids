abstract:
- content: "<p>The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses was depleted, IPv6 migration has
    become the most imperative task. There are many transition mechanisms designed
    for different scenarios, however, some problems arosed in the practice. FAST6,
    specified in this draft, is based on the ideas of native dual stack and address
    sharing. It can solves the mixed route problem and simplify the planning of private
    IPv4 address space by using tunnel technology. FAST6 is an economical and stable
    technology for smooth network transition.</p>"
