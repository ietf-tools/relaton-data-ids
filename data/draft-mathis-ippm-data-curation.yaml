abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the nomenclature, requirements and framework
    for handling per-sample metadata for a live archive of Internet measurements.
    By archive, we mean that once captured, the data MUST NOT be altered or deleted.
    By live, we mean that new data from ongoing measurements are being continuously
    appended to the archive. The purpose of the metadata is to support the use of
    the Scientific Method in the study the archived data. Under the principle of full
    disclosure, the Scientific Method requires that later researchers be able to repeat
    earlier studies using the original data, but refined by new insights (such as
    improved calibration) gained from other intervening studies.</p>"
