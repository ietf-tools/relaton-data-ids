abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a secure multicast plane between PIM-SM domains
    through a MSDP bridge. The MSDP bridge is the MSDP peering topology with a GRE
    tunnel associated with each pair of MSDP routers. A multicast protocol such as
    DVMRP, PIM-DM or BGMP runs over the MSDP bridge to forward secure multicast data
    in the global key space. As a RP, each security broker in an interested domain
    translates the data from the MSDP bridge to the local domain and forwards the
    data in the local key space. This approach is perceived as a transitional solution
    to the multicast security between PIM-SM domains. It will enable group security
    association to differ from one shared tree to another, and will essentially facilitate
    group key distribution.</p>"
