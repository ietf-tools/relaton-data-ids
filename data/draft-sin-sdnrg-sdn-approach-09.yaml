abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been one of the major buzz words
    of the networking industry for the past couple of years. And yet, no clear definition
    of what SDN actually covers has been broadly admitted so far. This document aims
    to clarify the SDN landscape by providing a perspective on requirements, issues,
    and other considerations about SDN, as seen from within a service provider environment.
    It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means but rather to suggest
    a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used under an SDN umbrella
    and to elaborate on the various pending issues the combined activation of such
    techniques inevitably raises. As such, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for
    the sake of clarification.</p>"
