abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol supports several mechanisms
    for authenticating the parties, including signatures with public-key certificates,
    shared secrets, and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods. Currently,
    each endpoint uses only one of these mechanisms to authenticate itself. This document
    specifies an extension to IKEv2 that allows the use of multiple authentication
    exchanges, using either different mechanisms or the same mechanism. This extension
    allows, for instance, performing certificate-based authentication of the client
    host followed by an EAP authentication of the user. When backend authentication
    servers are used, they can belong to different administrative domains, such as
    the network access provider and the service provider. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
