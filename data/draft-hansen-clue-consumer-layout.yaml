abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is for discussion in the CLUE working group. It proposes
    adding the ability for the consumer to provide specific information to the provider.
    This document proposes allowing consumers to include spatial parameters in their
    consumer requests to providers in order to improve the provider's ability to assign
    media to streams in a way that is helpful for rendering. The solution proposed
    here is in partial response to CLUE Task #10, Does Framework provide sufficient
    info for receiver?</p>"
