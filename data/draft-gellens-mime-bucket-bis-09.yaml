abstract:
- content: "<p>Several MIME type/subtype combinations exist that can contain different
    media formats. A receiving agent thus needs to examine the details of such media
    content to determine if the specific elements can be rendered given an available
    set of codecs. Especially when the end system has limited resources, or the connection
    to the end system has limited bandwidth, it is helpful to know from the Content-
    Type alone if the content can be rendered. This document specifies two parameters,
    'codecs' and 'profiles', that are used with various MIME types or type/subtype
    combinations to allow for unambiguous specification of the codecs employed by
    the media formats contained within, or the profile(s) of the overall container
    format. This document obsoletes RFC 4281; RFC 4281 defines the 'codecs' parameter,
    which this document retains in a backwards compatible manner with minor clarifications;
    the 'profiles' parameter is added by this document. By labeling content with the
    specific codecs indicated to render the contained media, receiving systems can
    determine if the codecs are supported by the end system, and if not, can take
    appropriate action (such as rejecting the content, sending notification of the
    situation, transcoding the content to a supported type, fetching and installing
    the required codecs, further inspection to determine if it will be sufficient
    to support a subset of the indicated codecs, etc.). Similarly, the profiles can
    provide an overall indication, to the receiver, of the specifications with which
    the content complies. This is an indication of the compatibility of the container
    format and its contents to some specification. The receiver may be able to work
    out the extent to which it can handle and render the content by examining to see
    which of the declared profiles it supports, and what they mean. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
