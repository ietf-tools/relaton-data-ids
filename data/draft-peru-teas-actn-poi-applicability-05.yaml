abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the applicability of the IETF Abstraction and
    Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) to Packet Optical Integration (POI),
    and IP and Optical DWDM domain internetworking. In this document, we highlight
    the IETF protocols and YANG data models that may be used for the ACTN and control
    of POI networks, with particular focus on the interfaces between the MDSC (Multi-
    Domain Service Coordinator) and the underlying Packet and Optical Domain Controllers
    (P-PNC and O-PNC) to support POI use cases.</p>"
