abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a textual convention, ReusableRow, similar to
    the RowStatus and StorageType textual conventions defined in RFC 2579 [7]. Like
    these two textual conventions, ReusableRow characterizes the conceptual row of
    which it is a part. It indicates whether, in the course of a cloning activity,
    the row should be duplicated (with, obviously, a different index value), or simply
    pointed to by one or more newly cloned objects. This cloning may involve the scripting-
    based techniques defined under the SNMP Configuration umbrella, but it need not:
    cloning can also be realized with ordinary SNMP Get and Set operations.</p>"
