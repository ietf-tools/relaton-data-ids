abstract:
- content: "<p>Network architectures have begun to shift from pure destination based
    routing to service aware routing. Operator requirements in this space include
    forcing traffic through particular service nodes (e.g. firewall, NAT) or transit
    nodes (e.g. segments). This document proposes an enhancement to BGP to accommodate
    these new requirements. This document proposes a pure control plane solution which
    allows traffic to be routed via an ordered set of transit points (links, nodes
    or services) on the way to traffic's destination, with no change in the forwarding
    plane. This approach is in contrast to other proposal in this space which provide
    similar capabilities via modifications to the forwarding plane.</p>"
