abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is submitted as part of the Midcom protocol selection
    process. It evaluates the suitability of the Diameter protocol as a transport
    for Midcom. The general conclusions are: . the Diameter architecture may be too
    heavy for the Midcom application, although this is a matter for discussion. It
    is clear in any event that much of the Diameter base is not needed; . a new application
    extension to Diameter would have to be defined to meet Midcom's requirements;
    . with these reservations, the protocol is a good fit to Midcom requirements.
    This version contains added details describing how to use Diameter to meet the
    requirements.</p>"
