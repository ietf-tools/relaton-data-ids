abstract:
- content: "<p>Uploading from peers located in a public WLAN hotspot has been reported
    to severely impact other current users' experiences, and raised caution from the
    operator's side who are willing to increasingly participate in building public
    WLAN facilities to offload the explosive mobile data traffic from cellular networks.
    Cooperation between the network operator and the P2P service providers in form
    of intra-domain P2P caches is expected to be an effective mechanism to solve the
    problem. This draft introduces considerations on ALTO deployment in terms of P2P
    caches and discusses potential extensions to the ALTO protocol to standardize
    this mutual cooperation.</p>"
