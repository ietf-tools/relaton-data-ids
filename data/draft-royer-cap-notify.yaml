abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a method used to ask for and receive notifications.
    These notifications will be the direct result of a stored components and the notifications
    or changes to components or the store and are represented in iCalendar format.
    This is an extensions to iCalendar objects. This memo has been updated to include
    non-CAP notificaitons. This memo includes a new CAP command types of 'REQUEST-NOTIFY',
    'NOTIFICATION', and 'CANCEL-NOTIFY', a new property of 'OBSERVER', a new iCalendar
    component 'NOTIFICATION', CAP capabilities of 'CAN-NOTIFY', 'NOTIFY-UPDATES',
    and 'ALLOW-NOTIFY-BOT'. A 'REQUEST-NOTIFY' command is a request to add an observer
    to an component in the 'TARGET' calendar. In addition the 'REQUEST-NOTIFY' command
    can alert the CUA of changes to specific components or in the calendar or calendar
    store. Everything is subject to VCAR restrictions. These are asynchronous notifications
    must be advertised by the CS and requested by the CUA. This memo discusses how
    to transport these iCalendar objects and using them with CAP. In addition if the
    CS and CUA support the 'NOTIFY-UPDATES' capability, then the CS will send 'NOTIFICATION'
    components to the CUA describing the UIDs or TARGETS that have changed since the
    currently authenticated CU was last connected allowing for easier synchronization.</p>"
