abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4 counterpart.
    An IPv6 subnet of size /64 can (in theory) accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19
    hosts, thus resulting in a much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than is
    typical in IPv4 networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or fewer unique addresses.
    As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous effort to perform
    address-scanning attacks against IPv6 networks; therefore, IPv6 address-scanning
    attacks have been considered unfeasible. This document formally obsoletes RFC
    5157, which first discussed this assumption, by providing further analysis on
    how traditional address-scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks and exploring
    some additional techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance.</p>"
