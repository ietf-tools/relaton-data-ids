abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 supports datagrams larger than 65535 bytes long, often referred
    to as jumbograms, through use of the Jumbo Payload hop-by-hop option. The UDP
    protocol has a 16-bit length field that keeps it from being able to make use of
    jumbograms, and though TCP does not have a length field, both the MSS option and
    the Urgent field are constrained by 16-bits. This document describes some simple
    changes that can be made to allow TCP and UDP to make use of IPv6 jumbograms.
