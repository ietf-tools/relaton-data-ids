- content: "<p>When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object
    identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use by that working group.
    This document describes the range of identifiers that were assigned in that donated
    range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation
    policies for any future assignments within that range.</p>"
