abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes security issues around implementation and use
    of the Direct Data Placement Protocol(DDP) and Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol
    (RDMAP). It first defines an architectural model for an RDMA Network Interface
    Card (RNIC), which can implement DDP or RDMAP and DDP. The model includes a definition
    of resources that can be attacked. This document then introduces various Trust
    Models between a local peer and a remote peer and the tools that can be used to
    create countermeasures against attacks. Finally, the document reviews various
    attacks and the countermeasures to be used against them, grouping the attacks
    into spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation
    of privilege.</p>"
