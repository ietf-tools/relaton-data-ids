abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
    (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal
    mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated.
    This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement (RA) extension)
    to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive-portal enforcement
    device, and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access. It is
    not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive
    portals; it is designed to be used in larger solutions. The method of authenticating
    to, and interacting with the captive portal is out of scope of this document.
    This document replaces RFC 7710. RFC 7710 used DHCP code point 160. Due to a conflict,
    this document specifies 114. [ This document is being collaborated on in Github
    at: https://github.com/capport-wg/7710bis. The most recent version of the document,
    open issues, etc should all be available here. The authors (gratefully) accept
    pull requests. Text in square brackets will be removed before publication. ]</p>"
