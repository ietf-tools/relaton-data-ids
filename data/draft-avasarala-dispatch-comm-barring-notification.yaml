abstract:
- content: "<p>3GPP is defining the protocol specification for the Communication Barring
    (CB) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem supplementary
    service and more particularly the dynamic incoming communication barring service.
    As part of dynamic incoming communication barring (ICB) service, a SIP based Event
    package framework is used for notifying users about communication barrings (dynamic
    and rule based) of their incoming communication sessions. This document proposes
    a new SIP event package for allowing users to subscribe to and receive such notifications.
    Users can further define filters to control the rate and content of such notifications.
    The proposed event package is applicable to the ICB supplementary service in IMS
    and may not be applicable to the general internet..</p>"
