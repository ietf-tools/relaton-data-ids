abstract:
- content: "<p>There are scenarios in which the home agent needs to trigger flow binding
    operations towards the mobile node, such as moving a flow from one access network
    to another based on network resource availability. In order for the home agent
    to be able to initiate interactions for flow bindings with the mobile node, this
    document defines new signaling messages and sub-options for Mobile IPv6. Flow
    bindings initiated by a home agent are supported for mobile nodes enabled by both
    IPv4 and IPv6.</p>"
