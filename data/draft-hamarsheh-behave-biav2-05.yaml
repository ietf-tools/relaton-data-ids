abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism for hosts with any network connectivity
    (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6 connectivity) to run applications of
    any capability (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6) without any modification
    to those applications. It is a generalisation of a previous experimental protocol
    called "Bump-in-the-API" (BIA) [RFC3338]. New mechanism of BIA allows a changeover
    between the application layer and the IP communication layers from IPv4 to IPv6
    and vice versa or IPv6 to IPv4 and vice versa, without requiring those applications
    to be converted in addressing capabilities, effectively shielding the application
    layer from IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. This is considered by the authors to be
    one of the essential conditions for the transition to IPv6 in the Internet to
    be successful.</p>
