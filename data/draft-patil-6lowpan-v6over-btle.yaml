abstract:
- content: "<p>Bluetooth low energy is a low power air interface technology that is
    defined by the bluetooth SIG. The standard bluetooth radio has been widely implemented
    and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and many other
    devices. The low power version of bluetooth is a new specification and enables
    the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors, smart meters, applicances,
    etc. There is an added value in the ability to communicate with sensors over IPv6.
    This document describes how IPv6 is transported over bluetooth low energy using
    6LoWPAN techniques.</p>"
