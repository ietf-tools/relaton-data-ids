abstract:
- content: "<p>In draft-ietf-mpls-sfl-framework the concept of MPLS synonymous flow
    labels (SFL) was introduced. This document describes a simple control protocol
    that runs over an associated control header to request, withdraw, and extend the
    lifetime of such labels. It is not the only control protocol that moght be used
    to support SFL, but it has the benefit of being able to be used without modifying
    of the existing MPLS control prodocols. The existance of this design is not intended
    to restrict the ability to enhance an existing MPLS control protocol to add a
    similar capability. A Querier MUST wait a configured time (suggested wait of 60
    seconds) before re-attempting a Withdraw request. No more than three Withdraw
    requests SHOULD be made. These restricctions are to prevent overloading the control
    plane of the actioning router.</p>"
