abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the most strategic problems for Internet Certification Authorities
    (ICAs) is the provisioning of revocation information in an efficient way. Current
    approaches for the distribution of OCSP responses over HTTP do not provide efficient
    solutions for the high volume of traffic that Internet CAs face when providing
    services for highly utilized websites. This document describes a new transport
    protocol for OCSP responses to efficiently provide revocation information about
    digital certificates. In particular, this specification defines how to distribute
    OCSP responses over DNS and how to define OCSP-over-DNS URLs in certificates.
    The use of the DNS system to distribute such information is meant to lower the
    costs of providing revocation services and increase the availability of revocation
    information by using the distributed nature of the DNS infrastructure.</p>"
