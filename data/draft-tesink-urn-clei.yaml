abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace (RFC
    3406) for the assignment of the Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) code,
    which is used in messages standardized by ANSI. The URN namespace is managed by
    Telcordia Technologies, Inc., as the maintenance agent for ANSI T1.213. The CLEI
    code is a globally unique, ten-character alphanumeric intelligent code assigned
    by Telcordia Technologies at the request of equipment suppliers. The CLEI code
    identifies communications equipment by specifying product type and features. There
    is a one-to-one relationship between a CLEI code and supplier's product ID (the
    manufacturer's name and the part number along with its version number). This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
