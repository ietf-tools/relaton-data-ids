abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution, referred as SNIF, that provides
    the means for any Internet connected device to: * allocate a globally unique anonymous
    hostname; * obtain and maintain a publicly trusted X.509 certificate issued for
    the allocated hostname; * accept incoming TLS connections on specific TCP ports
    of the allocated hostname from any TLS clients that are capable of sending Server
    Name Indication. The private key associated with the X.509 certificate is securely
    stored on the TLS terminating device, and is never exposed to any other party
    at any step of the process. About This Document This note is to be removed before
    publishing as an RFC. Status information for this document may be found at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zubov-snif.
    Information can be found at https://snif.host. Source for this draft and an issue
    tracker can be found at https://github.com/vesvault/snif-i-d.</p>"
