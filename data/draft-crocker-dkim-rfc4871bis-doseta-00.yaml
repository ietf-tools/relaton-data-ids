abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization
    that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating
    the domain with the message. This can be an author's organization, an operational
    relay or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of the
    signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion of responsibility
    is validated through a cryptographic signature and querying the signer's domain
    directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to
    recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to a message
    or its content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.</p>"
