abstract:
- content: "<p>Source route based Extensible IP Network(EIPv4) implementation can
    efficiently resolve the problem of IP address shortage. It is necessary to provide
    domain name service in EIPv4 to make it suitable for practical application. Here
    provides a way to DNS extension for EIPv4. It discusses how to extend the architecture
    of DNS into two-level extensible IP network architecture to provide query between
    domain name and IP node position denotation. And a new DNS RR type has been defined
    for this purpose.</p>"
