abstract:
- content: "<p>The lack of up-to-date documentation on IP multicast address allocation
    and assignment procedures has caused a great deal of confusion. To clarify the
    situation, this memo describes the allocation and assignment techniques and mechanisms
    currently (as of this writing) in use. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
