abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes an extension to the HTTP protocol allowing web host
    operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to remember ("pin") the hosts' cryptographic
    identities for a given period of time. During that time, UAs will require that
    the host present a certificate chain including at least one Subject Public Key
    Info structure whose fingerprint matches one or more of the pinned fingerprints
    for that host. By effectively reducing the scope of authorities who can authenticate
    the domain during the lifetime of the pin, pinning may reduce the incidence of
    man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised Certification Authorities and other
    authentication errors and attacks.</p>
