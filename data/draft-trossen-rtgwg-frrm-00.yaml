abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a communication semantic for multicast that
    is initiated through forward requests, resulting in dynamic return multicast to
    the set of initiating clients. The key dynamic nature here is the return multicast
    relations being possibly different for every transmission. We introduce this semantic
    more formally, present exemplifying use cases and then focus on realizing this
    semantic using two multicast technologies. Although this document formally introduces
    the FRRM semantic as a new communication semantic, it does not intend to show
    the realization of it through the specific multicast technologies in all details.
    This is left for separate documents, if desired.</p>"
