abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes how to carry dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) signalling,
    other tone signals, and telephony events in RTP packets. It obsoletes RFC 2833.
    This memo captures and expands upon the basic framework defined in RFC 2833, but
    retains only the most basic event codes. It sets up an IANA registry to which
    other event code assignments may be added. Companion documents add event codes
    to this registry relating to modem, fax, text telephony, and channel-associated
    signalling events. The remainder of the event codes defined in RFC 2833 are conditionally
    reserved in case other documents revive their use. This document provides a number
    of clarifications to the original document. However, it specifically differs from
    RFC 2833 by removing the requirement that all compliant implementations support
    the DTMF events. Instead, compliant implementations taking part in out-of-band
    negotiations of media stream content indicate what events they support. This memo
    adds three new procedures to the RFC 2833 framework: subdivision of long events
    into segments, reporting of multiple events in a single packet, and the concept
    and reporting of state events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
