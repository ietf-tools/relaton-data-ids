abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the procedure for proper handling of incoming
    liaison statements from other standards development organizations (SDOs), consortia,
    and industry fora, and for generating liaison statements to be transmitted from
    IETF to other SDOs, consortia and industry fora. This procedure allows IETF to
    effectively collaborate with other organizations in the international standards
    community. The IETF expects that liaison statements might come from a variety
    of organizations, and it may choose to respond to many of those. The IETF is only
    obligated to respond if there is an agreed liaison relationship, however. This
    document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
