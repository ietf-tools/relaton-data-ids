abstract:
- content: <p>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol supports
    the retrieval of core identity resources such as users and groups. In order to
    avoid overwhelming the SCIM client or service provider, SCIM defines index and
    count pagination query parameters that can be used "page through" large numbers
    of resources. For some SCIM service providers there are advantages in implementing
    cursor- based pagination as an alternative to index-based pagination. This document
    defines a simple extension to the SCIM protocol and core schema to assure interoperability
    of SCIM implementations that need to realize the advantages cursor-based pagination.</p>
