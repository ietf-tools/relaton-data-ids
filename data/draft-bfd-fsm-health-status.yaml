abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection operates in different modes. When
    BFD runs in asynchronous mode requires hello packet needs to be transmitted and
    received on regular intervals. In software based BFD application, hello packets
    processing path may be heavy weight which may involve many processing levels to
    reach BFD application. On a scaled system, processing delay may not be constant
    at all the time and this processing delay does appear at any point between software
    path entry point and BFD application. This delay needs to be identified and suppressed
    otherwise system may end up on false link failure detection. This internet draft
    deals on this particular case. Since introducing new Diagnostic bit, it requires
    to update RFC5880.</p>"
