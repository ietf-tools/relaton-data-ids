abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to construct a non-interactive proof via
    the Fiatâ€“Shamir transformation, using a generic procedure that compiles an interactive
    proof into a non-interactive one by relying on a stateful hash object that provides
    a duplex sponge interface. The duplex sponge interface requires two methods: absorb
    and squeeze, which respectively read and write elements of a specified base type.
    The absorb operation incrementally updates the sponge's internal hash state, while
    the squeeze operation produces variable-length, unpredictable outputs. This interface
    can be instantiated with various hash functions based on permutation or compression
    functions. This specification also defines codecs to securely map elements from
    the prover into the duplex sponge domain, and from the duplex sponge domain into
    verifier messages.</p>"
