- content: "<p>The memo 'MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)'
    [RFC 2557] specifies how to send packaged aggregate HTML objects in MIME format.
    This memo is an accompanying informational document, intended to be an aid to
    developers. This document is not an Internet standard. Issues discussed are implementation
    methods, caching strategies, problems with rewriting of URIs, making messages
    suitable both for mailers which can and which cannot handle Multipart/related
    and handling recipients which do not have full Internet connectivity.</p>"
