abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol schema
    which can be used to implement a certificate store for X.509 certificates. Specifically,
    two structural object classes for X.509 user and CA certificates are defined.
    Key fields of a certificate are stored in LDAP attributes so that applications
    can easily retrieve the certificates needed by using basic LDAP search filters.
    Multiple certificates for a single entity can be stored and retrieved.</p>"
