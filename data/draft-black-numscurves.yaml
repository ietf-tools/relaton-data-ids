abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a family of deterministically generated Nothing
    Up My Sleeve (NUMS) elliptic curves over prime fields offering high practical
    security in cryptographic applications, including Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    and X.509 certificates. The domain parameters are defined for both classical Weierstrass
    curves, for compatibility with existing applications, and modern twisted Edwards
    curves, allowing further efficiency improvements for a given security level.</p>"
