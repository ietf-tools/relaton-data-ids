abstract:
- content: "<p>The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in network management
    (NM) solutions is becoming a reality. It is mainly supported by the need to resolve
    complex problems arisen from the acceptance of SDN/ NFV technologies as well as
    network slicing. Thus, the AINEMA framework, as discussed in this document, is
    required to keep focus and organize the efforts on applying AI to NM. This is
    enlarged by the inclusion of external events in NM operations as well as the consideration
    of a full intelligence process instead of simple AI- based guesses. Such process
    will be highly based in reasoning and formal and target-based intelligence analysis
    and decision. This will allow computer and network system infrastructures to grow
    in complexity. The same applies to user demands. The construction and maintenance
    of AINEMA requires a comprehensive inclusion of several mechanisms. For instance,
    although there has been a lot of effort to make Machine Learning (ML) solutions
    reliable and acceptable, other mechanisms have been forgotten. It is the particular
    case of reasoning, which is the key within AINEMA. It will provide enormous benefits
    to NM solutions by, for example, inferring new knowledge and applying different
    kind of rules (e.g. logical) to choose from several actions. While ML solutions
    work with data, so their only requirement from the network infrastructure is data
    retrieval, AINEMA will work in collaboration to the network it is managing. This
    makes the challenges arisen from intelligent reasoning essential for the evolution
    of NM. They will be addressed within the context of AINEMA.</p>"
