abstract:
- content: "<p>Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible that
    they have received new mail. Most of these methods involve polling to check for
    new messages periodically. A push method handled by the final delivery agent gives
    users quicker notifications and saves server resources. This document does not
    specify the notification method but is expected that using existing instant messaging
    infrastructure such as Zephyr, ICQ, or SMS messages will be popular. This draft
    describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language that allows users
    to give specific preferences for notification of Sieve actions.</p>"
