abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Slicing is one of the core featrures in 5G. End-to-end network
    slicing consists of 3 major types of network segments: Access Network (AN), Mobile
    Core Network (CN) and Transport Network (TN). This draft describes the procedure
    of mapping relationship between 5G end-to-end network slice into and transport
    network slice defined in IETF. This draft also intends to expose some gaps in
    the existing network management plane and data plane to support inter-domain network
    slice mapping. Further work may require cooperation between IETF and 3GPP (or
    other standard organizations). The definition of data model, signaling protocol
    extension and new encapsulation is out of the scope of this draft.</p>"
