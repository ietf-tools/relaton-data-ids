abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been observed that the current IETF standard designations, STD
    nnnn and BCP nnnn designation, have not worked well. Problems have been found
    when one of them is used either as a stable reference for external specifications
    or as a combined reference for multiple documents linked together into a single
    document. This document proposes two changes to these designations. The first
    of these changes would create a new document series and assign a new number and
    acronym to a specification when it enters the first level of the Standards Track
    (or is first designated as a BCP). The second would migrate the concept of STDs
    and BCPs numbering of RFCs into actual documents that detail what they identify,
    their publication information and their change history. The document also specifies
    a set of minor standards process changes to accommodate and integrate the new
    style of doing things that is represented by the new document series.</p>"
