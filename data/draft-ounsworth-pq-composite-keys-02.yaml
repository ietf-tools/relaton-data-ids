abstract:
- content: '<p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
    of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor the new incoming
    algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the required data lifetimes.
    The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptalanysis,
    while the incoming post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
    mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that have not had
    sufficient maturing time to rule out classical cryptanalytic attacks and implementation
    bugs. Cautious implementors may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such that
    an attacker would need to break all of them in order to compromise the data being
    protected. For digital signatures, this is referred to as "dual", and for encryption
    key establishment this as reffered to as "hybrid". This document, and its companions,
    defines a specific instantiation of the dual and hybrid paradigm called "composite"
    where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key, signature,
    or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) such that they can be treated as a single
    atomic object at the protocol level. EDNOTE: the terms "dual" and "hybrid" are
    currently in flux. We anticipate an Informational draft to normalize terminology,
    and will update this draft accordingly. This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey
    and CompositePrivateKey, which are sequences of the respective structure for each
    component algorithm. The generic composite variant is defined which allows arbitrary
    combinations of key types to be placed in the CompositePublicKey and CompositePrivateKey
    structures without needing the combination to be pre-registered or pre-agreed.
    The explicit variant is also defined which allows for a set of algorithm identifier
    OIDs to be registered together as an explicit composite algorithm and assigned
    an OID. This document is intended to be coupled with corresponding documents that
    define the structure and semantics of composite signatures and encryption, such
    as [draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-05] and draft- ounsworth-pq-composite-kem
    (yet to be published).</p>'
