abstract:
- content: "<p>RTP Media Chains usually rely on piping encoder output directly to
    packetizers. Media packetization formats often support a specific codec format
    and optimize RTP packets generation accordingly. With the development of Selective
    Forward Unit (SFU) solutions, RTP Media Chains used in WebRTC solutions are increasingly
    relying on application-specific transforms that sit between encoder and packetizer
    on one end and between depacketizer and decoder on the other end. These transforms
    are typically encrypting media content so that the media content is not readable
    from the SFU, for instance using [SFrame] or [WebRTCInsertableStreams]. In that
    context, RTP packetizers can no longer expect to use packetization formats that
    mandate media content to be in a specific codec format. This document provides
    a solution to that problem by describing a RTP packetization format that can be
    used for many media content, and how to negotiate use of this format. This document
    also describes a solution to allow SFUs to continue performing packet routing
    on top of this RTP packetization format.</p>"
