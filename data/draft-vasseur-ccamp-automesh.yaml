abstract:
- content: "<p>The set up of a full mesh of MPLS TE LSPs among a set of Label Switch
    Router (LSR) is common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either
    for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast
    Reroute. Such deployment requires the configuration of potentially a large number
    of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number LSRs). This document specifies
    IGP (OSPF and IS-IS) traffic engineering extensions so as to provide an automatic
    discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh, leading to an automatic mechanism
    to set up TE LSP mesh(es) (also referred to as a mesh-group in this document).</p>"
