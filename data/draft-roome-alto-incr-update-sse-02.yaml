abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] protocol
    provides network related information to client applications so that clients may
    make informed decisions. To that end, an ALTO Server provides Network and Cost
    Maps. Using those maps, an ALTO Client can determine the costs between endpoints.
    However, the ALTO protocol does not define a mechanism to allow a client to obtain
    updates to those maps, other than by periodically re-fetching them. Because the
    maps may be large (potentially tens of megabytes), and because only parts of the
    maps may change frequently (especially Cost Maps), that can be extremely inefficient.
    Therefore this document presents a mechanism to allow an ALTO Server to provide
    updates to ALTO Clients. Updates can be both immediate, in that the server can
    send updates as soon as they are available, and incremental, in that if only a
    small section of a map changes, the server can send just the changes.</p>"
