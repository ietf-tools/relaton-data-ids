abstract:
- content: "<p>In the DNS, resolvers employ caching to reduce both latency for end
    users and load on authoritative name servers. The process of resolution may result
    in one of three types of responses: (1) a response containing the requested data;
    (2) a response indicating the requested data does not exist; or (3) a non-response
    due to a resolution failure in which the resolver does not receive any useful
    information regarding the data's existence. This document concerns itself only
    with the third type. RFC 2308 specifies requirements for DNS negative caching.
    There, caching of type (1) and (2) responses is mandatory and caching of type
    (3) responses is optional. This document updates RFC 2308 to require negative
    caching for DNS resolution failures.</p>"
