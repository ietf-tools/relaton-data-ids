abstract:
- content: "<p>The single path transport provided by the Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP) can be extended to a multipath transport session for multi-homed end hosts
    by coupling several TCP connections over multiple interfaces of the end hosts.
    Payload Multi-connection Transport (PLMT) is a multipath protocol variant that
    encodes all the control/signaling information in the payload of TCP connections
    and therefore requires no additional TCP options. PLMT allows for the simultaneous
    use of the multiple connections over potentially disjoint paths while being mostly
    backward compatible to single path transport of TCP. PLMT operates as an additional
    protocol layer between the network stack and the application layer. This document
    describes PLMT as an example for a multipath mechanism that could possibly be
    realized entirely in the user-space of an operating system.</p>"
