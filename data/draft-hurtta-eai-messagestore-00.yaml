abstract:
- content: "<p>The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) is implemented by allowing
    UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers. UTF8SMTP extension of ESMTP
    takes care that mails with UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers
    are not delivered to EAI non-compliant SMTP servers. This document describes mechanism
    how to keep messages with UTF-8 characters on mail headers separated from EAI
    non-compliant Mail User Agents. This document also describes general requirements
    for UTF8SMTP Message Store.</p>"
