abstract:
- content: "<p>Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) is predicated on
    the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-user requests in a functionally
    equivalent manner to the upstream CDN (uCDN). The uCDN must be able to assess
    the ability of the dCDN to handle individual requests. The CDNI Footprint &amp;
    Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) is provided for the advertisement of
    capabilities and the footprints to which they apply by the dCDN to the uCDN. This
    document describes an approach to implementing the CDNI FCI.</p>"
