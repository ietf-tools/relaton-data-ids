abstract:
- content: "<p>This protocol is designed to allow general indexing from most of the
    attribute-value based directory services. It is an extension of the current WHOIS++
    indexing protocol. Also, this protocol is designed to be implemented in such a
    way as to allow many different types of protocols (X.500, WHOIS++, SOLO, LDAP,
    etc) to use a basic server which speaks all these protocols.</p>"
