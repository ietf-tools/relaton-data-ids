abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we describe extensions to suitable ad hoc network
    routing protocols in order to provide support for service discovery. Typical Internet
    applications require information such as name resolution, a web proxy IP address,
    access to print services etc. While [manet] protocols have focussed on providing
    basic routing support for communication, this document addresses the problem of
    discovering services along with routes to those services.</p>"
