abstract:
- content: "<p>IP makes certain assumptions about the L2 forwarding behavior of a
    multi-access IP link. However, there are several forms of intentional partitioning
    of links ranging from split-horizon to Private VLANs that violate some of those
    assumptions. This document specifies that link behavior and how IP handles links
    with those properties.</p>"
