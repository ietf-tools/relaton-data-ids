abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] requires that when a BGP speaker receives an
    OPEN message with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the speaker must
    terminate BGP peering. This complicates introduction of new capabilities in BGP.
    This document defines new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities, that is expected
    to facilitate introduction of new capabilities in BGP by providing graceful capability
    negotiation. The proposed parameter is backward compatible - a router that supports
    the parameter can maintain BGP peering with a router that doesn't support the
    parameter.</p>"
