abstract:
- content: "<p>Path-Aware Semantic Address (PASA), proposes to algorithmically assign
    addresses to nodes in a 6lo environment so to achieve stateless forwarding, hence,
    allowing to avoid using a routing protocol. PASA is more suitable for stable and
    static wireline connectivity, in order to avoid renumbering due to topology changes.
    Even in such kind of scenarios, reliability remains a concern. This memo tackles
    specifically reliability in PASA deployments, analyzing possible broad solution
    categories to solve the issue.</p>"
