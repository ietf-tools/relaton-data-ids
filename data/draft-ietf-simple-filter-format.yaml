abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of changes to a
    state of a resource. The document does not describe a mechanism whereby filtering
    of event notification information can be achieved. Filtering is a mechanism for
    defining the preferred notification information to be delivered and for specifying
    triggers that cause that information to be delivered. In order to enable this,
    a format is needed to enable the subscriber to describe the state changes of a
    resource that cause notifications to be sent to it and what those notifications
    are to contain. This document presents a format in the form of an XML document.
