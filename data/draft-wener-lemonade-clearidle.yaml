abstract:
- content: "<p>The IMAPRev4 specification supports unsolicited responses being sent
    to a client at any time. The IDLE specification defines a way for a client to
    sit in an idle connection waiting to receive these responses. This document clarifies
    and extends the set of responses that a client may receive while in the idle state.
    The desire is to allow a client to predict exactly what set of unsolicited responses
    it can rely on receiving when listening on an idle connection.</p>"
