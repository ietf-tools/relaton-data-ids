abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a control protocol to setup tunnels between
    a client and a tunnel server or broker. It provides a framework for the negociation
    of tunnel parameters between the two entities. It is a generic TCP protocol based
    on simple XML messaging. This framework protocol enables the negociation of any
    kind of tunnel, and is extensible to support new parameters or extensions. The
    first target application is to setup IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels which is one of the
    transition mechanism identified by the ngtrans and ipv6 working groups. This IPv6
    over IPv4 tunnel setup application of the generic TSP protocol is defined by a
    profile of the TSP protocol, in a companion document.</p>"
