abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a base85 text encoding for arbitrary binary data
    that is suitable for use in XML documents. This encoding requires approximately
    15/16 of the space of the MIME Base64 encoding that is currently supported as
    a primitive datatype in the XML Schema definition language. In a UTF-8 encoded
    XML entity, Base85 therefore has 3/4 of the overhead of Base64.</p>"
