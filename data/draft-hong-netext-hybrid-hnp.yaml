abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming where a mobile node
    can connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces for simultaneous access
    or inter-technology handoff. However, for an inter-technology handoff, PMIPv6
    does not allow simultaneous access since all the home network prefixes associated
    with one interface are delivered to another interface of a mobile node. In addition,
    if we assume that the flow is classified by home network prefix, then the PMIPv6
    cannot support flow mobility since it requires moving just some home network prefixes
    between interfaces. In this document, we propose a hybrid home network prefix
    assignment (HHNPA) scheme where both the static prefix model and the dynamic prefix
    model are used. By using these two different home network prefix models, it can
    support flow mobility that some home network prefixes are moved to another interface
    and some home network prefixes are remained at existing interface.</p>"
