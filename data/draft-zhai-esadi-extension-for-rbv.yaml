abstract:
- content: "<p>In a virtual RBridge(RBv), traffic from end station ES1 to ES2 will
    enter a TRILL campus through one member RBridge RB1 of RBv, but reverse traffic
    might choose another member RBridge RB2 to leave TRILL campus. If RB1 can't obtain
    the location of ES2 via other means, it has to treat the traffic to ES2 as unknown
    destination traffic and multicasts it in TRILL campus. However, if RB2 can share
    its learned MAC addresses with RB1, the above problem can be resolved. Based on
    appropriate extensions of ESADI, this document proposes, in control plane, an
    approach for informations synchronization within a group of RBridges. Current
    informations mainly include end station addresses, but may include other informations
    in the future.</p>"
