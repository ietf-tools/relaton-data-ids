- content: "<p>In this document a formal model of a policy is presented in the context
    of a generic AAA environment. We will focus our attention on that kind of policy
    that is evaluated in response to a request of a user [OBJMSG]. That policy will
    determine all requirements that need to be fulfilled before the service asked
    for will be delivered. We will introduce the concept of a Driving Policy.</p>"
