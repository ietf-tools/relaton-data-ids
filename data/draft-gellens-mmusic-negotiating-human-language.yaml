abstract:
- content: <p>Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and preferences
    regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. When establishing interactive
    communication "calls" there needs to be a way to communicate and ideally match
    (i.e., negotiate) the caller's language preferences with the capabilities of the
    called party. This is especially important with emergency calls, where a call
    can be routed to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or call taker capable
    of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged
    into the call during setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as
    an example, when calling a company call center). This document describes the need
    and expected use, and describes a solution using new SDP stream attributes plus
    an optional SIP "hint."</p>
