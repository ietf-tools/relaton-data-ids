abstract:
- content: "<p>A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources
    and the associated policies on each of a connected set of links in the underlay
    network. An NRP could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced
    VPN services or RFC 9543 network slice services. For the instantiation of an NRP,
    NRP- specific information and policy need to be advertised to the network nodes
    involved in the NRP, so that the NRP-specific state can be created and NRP-specific
    behavior can be enabled. The mechanism for instantiating NRPs on the involved
    network elements is called NRP Policy. This document specifies the BGP extensions
    for advertising NRP Policy information to the set of network nodes involved in
    the NRP. The NRP Policy is advertised using a separate BGP Subsequent Address
    Family Identifier (SAFI) of the BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) Address Family, which
    allows to reuse the TLVs defined in BGP-LS without impacting the base BGP and
    BGP-LS functionality.</p>"
