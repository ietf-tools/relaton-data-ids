abstract:
- content: "<p>In the current version of mobile IP a home agent converts a incoming
    generic multicast datagram to multiple unicast- encapsulated datagrams addressed
    to each mobile node. This kind of multicast handling logically works, while suffering
    from the performance degradation. Small Group Multicast (SGM) is a newly developed
    multicast protocol whose level 3.5 header carries multiple unicast destination
    addresses [2]. SGM support in mobile IP enables the home agent to forward a generic
    multicast datagram to a foreign agent with one SGM datagram, eliminating the severe
    performance degradation.</p>"
