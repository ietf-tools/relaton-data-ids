abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the Real-time Transport Protocol, RTP (RFC1889),
    could be extended to include support for parts of the framework called Scalable
    Reliable Multicast. The scheme proposed could be used for transporting a data
    flow reliably over the transport protocols supported by RTP in a light-weight
    way. This could be used for numerous applications, for instance white-boards,
    semi-reliable audio/video and messaging/data-transfers within group-ware applications.</p>"
