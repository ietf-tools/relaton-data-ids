abstract:
- content: "<p>In the deployment of BGP/MPLS VPN,the PE(Provider Edge)Device should
    maintain all the VPN routes of the VPNs which it belong to.When there are many
    VPNs converged by a PE,and the capacity of PE is relevant limited,then the bottleneck
    will be encountered.Another problem is that the current BGP/MPLS VPN model is
    something of a 'Plane Modle' where the demand of the performance of the PE device
    are all the same no matter which layer the PE device is belongs to.However,the
    typical network is 'Core-Convergence-Access(Edge)' model,and the performance of
    the device is superior in Core Layer and inferior in Access Layer,and the scale
    of network is large in Access Layer and small in Core Layer,the routes are converged
    in every layer,so in current 'Plane Modle',when PE device push to the edge layer,it
    has to maintain more VPN routes,this makes it difficult to extend the PE device
    to edge layer.This document defines an model of Hierarchy of Provider Edge Device
    in BGP/MPLS VPN,where Hierarchy of Provider Edge Device can be composed of several
    device and every device take on the different part,partake the function of the
    former concentrative PE,we call this model 'Hierarchy Model',In this model the
    demand of performance in Routing and Switching is strict to the PE device in High
    layer,loose to the PE device in edge layer. One HoPE can be composed of a SPE
    and UPES connected to the SPE, or be composed of a high-level SPE and HoPEs connected
    the high level SPE and and build up a new HoPE.This build is called nesting of
    HoPE,and this kind of nesting can be done for many times.Thus the former HoPE
    connect to the high-level SPE as a role of UPE,and the new HoPE can connect a
    single UPE too.</p>"
