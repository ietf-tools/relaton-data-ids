abstract:
- content: "<p>The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the RIRs is
    causing service providers around the world to question how they will continue
    providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers when there are no longer
    sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per subscriber. Several possible
    solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4
    addressing. These solutions give rise to a number of issues and this memo identifies
    those common to all such address sharing approaches. Solution- specific discussions
    are out of scope.</p>"
