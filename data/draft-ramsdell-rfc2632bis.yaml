abstract:
- content: "<p>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), described in
    [SMIME-MSG], provides a method to send and receive secure MIME messages. Before
    using a public key to provide security services, the S/MIME agent MUST certify
    that the public key is valid. S/MIME agents MUST use PKIX certificates to validate
    public keys as described in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX)
    Certificate and CRL Profile [KEYM]. S/MIME agents MUST meet the certificate processing
    requirements documented in this document in addition to those stated in [KEYM].</p>"
