abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some suggested practices for registering internationalized
    domain names (IDNs) in a zone. Before accepting registrations of domain names
    into a zone, the zone's registry should decide which codepoints in the Unicode
    character set the zone will accept. The registry should also decide whether particular
    characters in a registered domain name should cause registration of multiple equivalent
    domain names; these domain names might be added to the zone or blocked from registration.
    This document also describes how to handle character variants in registering IDNs,
    and how to publish tables that list the character variants.</p>"
