abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility protocol that
    enables mobility management for an IP host as it moves across different points
    of attachment within the mobility domain. An IP host whose mobility is being managed
    by the network is unaware of the access networks capability providing PMIPv6 mobility
    management on its behalf. This draft proposes mechanisms by which the host is
    informed of PMIPv6, as well as means to actively discover such capability in the
    network the host is attaching to. The ability of the host to discover or be aware
    of PMIPv6 support in the access network enables better decision making in terms
    of the network selection, attach procedure, choice of mobility management, as
    well as the service/session and even application configuration abilities.</p>"
