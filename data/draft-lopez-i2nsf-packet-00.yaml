abstract:
- content: "<p>In the design of interfaces to allow for the provisioning of network-
    based security functions (NSFs), a critical consideration is to prevent the creation
    of implied constraints. This draft makes the recommendation that such interfaces
    be designed from the paradigm of processing packets on the network. NSFs ultimately
    are packet-processing engines that inspect packets traversing networks, either
    directly or in context to sessions to which the packet is associated.</p>"
