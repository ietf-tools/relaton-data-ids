abstract:
- content: "<p>A tag switching architecture is described in [1]. Tag Switching enables
    the use of ATM Switches as Tag Switching Routers. The ATM Switches run network
    layer routing algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), and their data forwarding
    is based on the results of these routing algorithms. No ATM-specific routing or
    addressing is needed. This document describes how the tag switching architecture
    is applied to ATM switches.</p>"
