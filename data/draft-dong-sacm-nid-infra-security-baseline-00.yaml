abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of the companion documents which describes the
    infrastructure layer security baseline YANG output for network infrastructure
    devices. The infrastructure layer security baseline includes all the fundamental
    security capabilities/functions about the device itself, which may also be provided
    by the device to the upper layer applications as a secure environment. In this
    particular document, the integrity measurement, cryptography security, secure
    key management, and secure certificate management are summarized to generate the
    data model.</p>"
