abstract:
- content: "<p>In many IETF documents several key words are used to signify the requirements
    in the spefcification. This document defines the requirement levels imposed by
    these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documments. The requirement
    levels are basically equivalent to the ones proposed by RFC 2119[1]. But easier
    to understand the strength of key words and to introduce new key words to the
    hierarchy of requirement levels if ever there's a need.</p>"
