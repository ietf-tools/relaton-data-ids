abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an address resolution process tailored to work
    under NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)[1] over Asynchronous Transfer Mode
    (ATM) network with mixture of PVC environment and SVC environment. Now consider
    the case where NHRP clients, each are connected to PVC network, try to communicate
    each other through SVC network existing on the path between the PVC networks of
    each client.</p>"
