abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses use cases, survey, and problem statement on
    IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (ITS). The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) networking.
    First, this document surveys use cases using V2V and V2I networking. Second, this
    document deals with some critical aspects in vehicular networking, such as vehicular
    network architectures, standardization activities, IP address autoconfiguration,
    routing, mobility management, DNS naming service, service discovery, and security
    and privacy. For each aspect, this document discusses problem statement to analyze
    the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements in IP-based vehicular
    networking. Finally, this document articulates discussions including the summary
    and analysis of vehicular networking aspects and raises deployment issues.</p>"
