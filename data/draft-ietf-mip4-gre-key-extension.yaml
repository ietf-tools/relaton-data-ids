abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) specification contains a Key
    field, which MAY contain a value that is used to identify a particular GRE data
    stream. This specification defines a new Mobile IP extension that is used to exchange
    the value to be used in the GRE Key field. This extension further allows the Mobility
    Agents to set up the necessary protocol interfaces prior to receiving the mobile
    node traffic. The new extension allows a Foreign Agent to request GRE tunneling
    without disturbing the Home Agent behavior specified for Mobile IPv4. GRE tunneling
    with the Key field allows the operators to have home networks that consist of
    multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which may have overlapping home addresses.
    When the tuple &lt;Care of Address, Home Address, and Home Agent Address&gt; is
    the same across multiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means
    for the Foreign Agent and Home Agent to identify data streams for the individual
    sessions based on the GRE key. In the absence of this key identifier, the data
    streams cannot be distinguished from each other -- a significant drawback when
    using IP-in-IP tunneling. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
