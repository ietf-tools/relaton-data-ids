abstract:
- content: <p>This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite intended
    for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in browsers -- "real-time
    communication on the Web". It intends to serve as a starting and coordination
    point to make sure that (1) all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal
    are findable and (2) the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are
    fully specified and on the right publication track. This document is an applicability
    statement -- it does not itself specify any protocol, but it specifies which other
    specifications implementations are supposed to follow to be compliant with Web
    Real-Time Communication (WebRTC).</p>
