abstract:
- content: '<p>This document explores whether there is a relation between the Internet
    architecture and the ability of people to exercise their rights to peaceful assembly
    and association online. It does so by asking the question: what are the protocol
    development considerations for freedom of assembly and association? The Internet
    increasingly mediates our lives, our relationships, and our ability to exercise
    our human rights. As a global assemblage, the Internet provides a public space,
    yet it is predominantly built on private infrastructure. Since Internet protocols
    and architecture play a central role in the management, development, and use of
    the Internet, we analyze the relation between protocols, architecture, and the
    rights to assemble and associate to mitigate infringements on those rights. This
    document concludes that the way in which infrastructure is designed and implemented
    impacts people''s ability to exercise their freedom of assembly and association.
    It is therefore recommended that the the potential impacts of Internet technologies
    should be assessed, reflecting recommendations of various UN bodies and norms.
    Finally, the document considers both the limitations on changing association and
    impact of "forced association" in the context of online platforms.</p>'
