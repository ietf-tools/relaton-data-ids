abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the transport of IP traffic
    from different routing realms inside a single network. In other words, this document
    describes a framework enabling a network operator to enable the parallel use of
    different IP routing realms within a single operated network. This framework may,
    for instance, be applied in the context of IPv4 private networks using an address
    reuse technology to offer internet connectivity or in the context of IPv4 and
    IPv6 interworking/migration. Till now, operating multiple realms within a single
    physical network was realised by the use of tunneling technologies. This document
    will introduce a non-tunnel based scheme for multiple realms interworking.</p>"
