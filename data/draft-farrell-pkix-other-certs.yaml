abstract:
- content: "<p>Some applications that associate state information with public key
    certificates can benefit from a way to link together a set of certificates belonging
    to the same end entity that can safely be considered to be equivalent for the
    purposes of referencing that application state information. This memo defines
    a certificate extension that supports such linkage that can allow applications
    to establish the required linkage without introducing a new application protocol
    data unit.</p>"
