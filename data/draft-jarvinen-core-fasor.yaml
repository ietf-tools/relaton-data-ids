abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an alternative retransmission timeout and congestion
    control back off algorithm for the CoAP protocol, called Fast-Slow RTO (FASOR).
    The algorithm specified in this document employs an appropriate and large enough
    back off of Retransmission Timeout (RTO) as the major congestion control mechanism
    to allow acquiring unambiguous RTT samples with high probability and to prevent
    building a persistent queue when retransmitting. The algorithm also aims to retransmit
    quickly using an accurately managed retransmission timeout when link- errors are
    occuring, basing RTO calculation on unambiguous round-trip time (RTT) samples.</p>"
