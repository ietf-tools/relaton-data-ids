abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing protocol
    in the Internet. Nevertheless this multicast protocol lacks connectivity debugging
    function, making it difficult to identify for example; -multicast routing problem,
    -source unavailability, -RP failure, etc... When a host wants to receive a multicast
    group/ channel, if for any reason the associated tree branch cannot be built,
    nothing exists to inform the receiver or its network about this failure. We propose
    here a new PIM message suitable for Join forwarding error notification. It is
    able to inform where and why such an error happened in the network and this without
    using a multicast traceroute mechanism. This message is also suitable to reduce
    globally the impact of useless branches in a PIM domain. Furthermore it should
    be used to block DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.</p>"
