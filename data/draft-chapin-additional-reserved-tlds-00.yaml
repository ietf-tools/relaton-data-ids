abstract:
- content: '<p>The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) defines a tree of names starting
    with root, ".", immediately below which are top level domain (TLD) names such
    as ".com" and ".us". In June 1999 RFC2606 reserved a small number of TLD names
    for use in documentation examples, private testing, experiments, and other circumstances
    in which it is desirable to avoid conflict with current or future actual TLD names
    in the DNS. There has been significant evolution of Internet engineering and operation
    practices since RFC2606 was published. In February 2013 RFC6761 defined criteria
    and procedures for reserving a domain name for special use, and established an
    IANA registry for such names. This document reserves eight domain name labels
    for special use in accordance with the criteria and procedures of RFC6761: localdomain,
    domain, lan, home, host, corp, mail, and exchange. It is important to note that
    TLD names may be reserved, in other contexts, for policy, political, or other
    reasons that are distinct from the IETF''s concern with Internet engineering and
    operations. This document reserves TLD names only for operational and engineering
    reasons.</p>'
