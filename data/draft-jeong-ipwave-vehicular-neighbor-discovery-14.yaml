abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) as an
    extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular networks. An
    optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
    mechanism are performed for having operation efficiency and also saving both wireless
    bandwidth and vehicle energy. In addition, three new ND options for prefix discovery,
    service discovery, and mobility information report are defined to announce the
    network prefixes and services inside a vehicle (i.e., a vehicle's internal network).</p>"
