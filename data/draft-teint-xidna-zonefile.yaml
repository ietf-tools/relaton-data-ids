- content: "<p>While the Domain Name System (DNS) has allowed any octets in labels
    and ressource records since its inception, traditionally, addresses used for hostnames,
    email addresses, and other names actuall used in the DNS were limited to ASCII
    characters. This memo defines an extension to allow the use of a wide range of
    internationalised addresses that need to be converted to ACE form on the wire,
    including domain names and email addresses in zone master files, without removing
    the ability to include arbitrary octets.</p>"
