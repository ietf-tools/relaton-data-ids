abstract:
- content: "<p>The notification extension document [ipp-ntfy] defines operations that
    a client can perform in order to create Subscription Objects in a Printer and
    carry out other operations on them. A Subscription Object represents a Subscription
    abstraction. The Subscription Object specifies that when one of the specified
    Events occurs, the Printer sends an asynchronous Event Notification to the specified
    Notification Recipient via the specified Delivery Method (i.e., protocol). The
    notification extension document [ipp-ntfy] specifies that each Delivery Method
    is defined in another document. This document is one such document, and it specifies
    the 'ipp-get' delivery method.</p>"
