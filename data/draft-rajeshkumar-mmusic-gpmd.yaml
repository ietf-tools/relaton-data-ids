abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new SDP attribute called general-purpose media
    descriptor (gpmd). The gpmd attribute allows the use of new informative parameters,
    gpmd parameters, to qualify existing media formats. These gpmd parameters are
    not part of the standard (e.g., MIME) definition of the media format and support
    for them with a given media format can not be assumed. Their use is therefore
    limited to cases where they provide information that may be of use to the other
    party in a session but is not critical to the use of the particular media format.
    This document also defines a specific gpmd parameter, voice-band data, which can
    be used to describe a media format as carrying voice-band data. This enables the
    receiver to optimize its handling of the media received.</p>"
