abstract:
- content: "<p>At the time the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee was set up
    the Internet Architecture Board had an internal structure significantly different
    from its current structure. This document aims to update the way in which the
    ex officio member from the IAB who serves on the IAOC is appointed, in order to
    better account for that change and better match the skills set out in RFC 4333.
    After community discussion, it is likely that this document will be split into
    two distinct parts: one which updates the IAOC membership section of the relevant
    BCP and another which describes the IAB's program.</p>"
