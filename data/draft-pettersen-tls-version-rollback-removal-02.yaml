abstract:
- content: "<p>Ever since vendors started deploying TLS 1.0 clients, these clients
    have had to handle server implementations that do not tolerate the TLS version
    supported by the client, usually by automatically signaling an older supported
    version instead. Such version rollbacks represent a potential security hazard,
    if the older version should become vulnerable to attacks. The same history repeated
    when TLS Extensions were introduced, as some servers would not negotiate with
    clients that sent these protocol extensions, forcing clients to reduce protocol
    functionality in order to maintain interoperability. This document outlines a
    procedure to help clients decide when they may use version rollback to maintain
    interoperability with legacy servers, under what conditions the clients should
    not allow version rollbacks, such as when the server has indicated support for
    the TLS Renegotiation Information extension. The intention of this procedure is
    to limit the use of automatic version rollback to legacy servers and eventually
    eliminate its use.</p>"
