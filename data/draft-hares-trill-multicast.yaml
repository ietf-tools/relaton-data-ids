abstract:
- content: "<p>Rbridges are transparent Layer 2 bridges that provide the ability to
    have an entire campus, with multiple physical links look like a single subnet.
    The Rbridge technology utilizes Rbridges to link together Layer 2 areas using
    spanning trees to calculate paths. The Rbridges run a link state protocol to determine
    the least cost paths Rbridges and exchange information about the location of MAC
    addresses. The Rbridges will run a level 1 or a single area routing protocol.
    To forward multicast packets, the Rbirdges may treat these as broadcast (sending
    the packets to all Rbridges) or use methods to snoop the Multicast MAC addresses
    (GARP, MAC learning) or IP/MAC address packets (IGMP/PIM snooping). Multicast
    Link State Rbridge connections suggest a Hybrid Multicast Link state extensions
    to ISIS and OSPF for Rbridges.</p>"
