abstract:
- content: "<p>Some NFSv4 servers allow a mode SETATTR to restore ACL permissions
    which were removed by a previous mode SETATTR. This allows servers to handle mode
    SETATTRs without destroying the information in ACLs. However, these temporarily
    masked permissions are not exposed to clients. This proposal adds an optional
    new file attribute, file_masks, which can be used by clients to see these temporarily
    masked permissions.</p>"
