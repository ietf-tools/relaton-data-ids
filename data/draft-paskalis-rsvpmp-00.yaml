abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility management and QoS provision have been research topics in
    the past years. Mobile IP is the dominant protocol for mobility management, whereas
    RSVP is a well established protocol for QoS provision. These protocols when deployed
    separately can work quite efficiently. However, their interworking has been widely
    recognized to be problematic. We propose a new approach that limits mobility and
    QoS related network modifications inside the domain in which a user moves.</p>"
