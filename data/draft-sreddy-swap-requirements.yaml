abstract:
- content: "<p>Workflow is intuitive and powerful paradigm for capturing business
    processes, reasoning about them, and process specifications to produce corresponding
    implementations that are supported by the information systems. There has been
    a growing acceptance of workflow technology in numerous application domains such
    as telecommunications, software engineering, manufacturing, production, finance
    and banking, laboratory sciences, healthcare, shipping and office automation.
    In the last few years, pervasive network connectivity, exploded growth of Internet
    and web technologies has changed our computational landscape to distributed, heterogeneous
    and network centric computing model from centralized, desktop-oriented, and homogenous
    computing. This has raised challenging requirements for workflow technologies
    in terms being required to support heterogeneous, distributed computing infrastructures,
    interoperability, scalability and availability. The main objective of this document
    is to identify various business requirements for Internet based Workflow Access
    Protocol to instantiate, control and monitor the workflow process instances. Definition
    and administration of process specifications are not discussed in this requirements.</p>"
