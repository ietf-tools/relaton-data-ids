abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless Sensors networks (WSNs) are type of wireless ad-hoc networks
    with reduced or no mobility. These networks combine wireless communication with
    minimal onboard computation facilities for sensing and monitoring of physical
    and environmental phenomena. Much work has been reported on different aspects
    of wireless sensors networks;however,less attention has been paid on addressing
    fault detection and recovery in these networks. Fault could be any thing which
    can lead communication break down as a whole or part of a wireless sensors network.Thus,
    detection of such fault attains a primary focus to support routine operations
    within such networks. Mobile Ad-hoc On Demand Data Delivery Protocol (MAODDP)
    belongs to on-demand data delivery type routing family of mobile ad-hoc networks.
    The contribution of this paper is to introduce an efficient fault detection and
    recovery mechanism for WSNs network. We believe proposed two step model can offer
    a robust solution for the fault management in Wireless Sensors Network.</p>"
