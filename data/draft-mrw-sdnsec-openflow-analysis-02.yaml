abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses the security properties of the OpenFlow Switch
    Specification version 1.3.0 (OpenFlow), a Software-Defined Network (SDN) solution
    produced by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF). It analyzes the suitability
    of OpenFlow for use in "the cloud" or on the open Internet. It also makes some
    suggestions about how OpenFlow could be made more secure for use in those environments.</p>
