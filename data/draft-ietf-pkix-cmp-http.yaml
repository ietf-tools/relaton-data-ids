abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to layer [CMP] over [HTTP]. A simple method
    for doing so is described in section 5.4 of [CMP], but that method does not accommodate
    a polling mechanism, which may be required in some environments. This document
    specifies an alternative method which uses the polling protocol defined in section
    5.2 of [CMP]. A new Content-Type for messages is also defined.</p>"
