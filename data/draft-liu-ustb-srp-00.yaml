abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Routing Protocol (SRP) is a secure and distributed routing
    protocol designed for Delay and Tolerant Networks networks of mobile nodes with
    location information. Commonly, each node acquires its own geographic position
    using a mechanism such as the Global Position System (GPS). The SRP addresses
    each node using the hybrid of its multi-level hierarchical address and unique
    identifier at the moment of network initialization. Certain measures were adopted
    to ensure security of the network.</p>"
