abstract:
- content: "<p>Constructing primary and backup explicit path Point-to-Multipoint Label
    Switched Paths is important from the point of view of providing protection switching
    in case the primary fails. It is absolutely essential that the backup P2MP LSPs
    constructed do not share risk with any of the links and nodes of the primary path.
    In the case of inter-AS P2MP TE-LSPs or in the case of inter-sub-AS (in the case
    of BGP-Confederations being deployed) P2MP TE-LSPs where BGP confederations are
    deployed within an AS, such protection switching can be provided by calculating
    primary and backup multicast distribution trees (read P2MP TE-LSPs) that dont
    intersect with each other. In this paper we propose a method by which inter-sub-AS
    P2MP TE-LSPs (hence even inter-AS P2MP TE-LSPs) can be constructed by first finding
    the AS level topology of the network (be it inter-AS or inter-sub-AS within a
    single AS) in question and secondly to compute the paths in such a way that they
    dont intersect or if necessary in the worst case partially intersect each other.
    The proposed scheme is explained with an example and subsequent discussion is
    done to elucidate its benefits to multicast in particular.</p>"
