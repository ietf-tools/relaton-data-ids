abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be used on
    networks, but the standards development process in the IETF does have an impact
    on society through its normative standards setting process. Among other things,
    the IETF's work affects what is perceived as technologically possible and useful
    where networking technologies are being deployed, and its standards reflect what
    is considered by the technical community to be feasible and good practice. Whereas
    there might not be agreement among the Internet protocol community on the specific
    political nature of the technological development process and its outputs, it
    is undisputed that standards and protocols are both products of a political process,
    and they can also be used for political means.</p>"
