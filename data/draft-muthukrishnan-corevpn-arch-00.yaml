abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents an approach for building core VPN services in the
    service provider backbone, as described in [Heinanen]. This approach does not
    depend on MPLS running in the backbone but will benefit from it. The central vision
    is for the service provider to provide a virtual router service to their customers.
    Ease of configuration, dynamic neighbor discovery, scaling and the use of existing
    routing protocols as they exist today without any modifications are the keystones
    of this architecture.</p>"
