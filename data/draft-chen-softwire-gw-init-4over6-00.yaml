abstract:
- content: "<p>Gateway-Initiated 4over6 (GI-4over6) is a variant of 4over6 mechanisms
    which include Public 4over6 ([I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6]) and Lightweight
    4over6 ([I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite]), and it's designed to satisfy
    the certain tunnel-based access scenario. The GI-4over6 extends the On-Link Client
    Relay Agent (LCRA) that is defined in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] and thus
    makes it enabled to help gateway device perform 4over6 CE function described in
    [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6], and lwB4 function described in [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite],
    while the public IPv4 addresses (and available ports) are assigned to the end
    hosts that behind the gateway device.</p>"
