abstract:
- content: "<p>The current ICMP 'Destination Unreachable - Communication Administratively
    Prohibited' message conveys one bit of information: the gateway is administratively
    filtering your packets. This memo proposes the addition of an ICMP 'Authentication
    Required' response to provide the more specific message that packets are being
    administratively prohibited until successful authentication.</p>"
