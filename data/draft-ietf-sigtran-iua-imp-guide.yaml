abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRAN
    mailing list and at future bakeoffs for IUA [RFC3057]. This document will be updated
    after each bakeoff augmenting the existing draft to include any new issues discovered
    during inter-operability testing. Two basic sets of problems are identified by
    this draft: first, issues that need to be addressed when the next revision of
    IUA is created, i.e. issues that should be remembered in a BIS document; second,
    issues that were found that are strictly implementation problems.</p>"
