abstract:
- content: "<p>To ensure an efficient data transport, meeting the requirements requested
    by today's IP-services the control and management of DWDM interfaces is a precondition
    for enhanced multilayer networking and for an further automation of network provisioning
    and operation. This document describes use cases and requirements for the control
    and management of optical interfaces parameters according to different types of
    single channel DMDM interfaces. The focus is on automating the network provisioning
    process irrespective on how it is triggered i.e. by EMS, NMS or GMPLS. This document
    covers management as well as control plane considerations in different management
    cases of a single channel DWDM interface The purpose is to identify the necessary
    information elements and processes to be used by control or management systems
    for further processing.</p>"
