abstract:
- content: "<p>The TWAMP protocol provides a common architecture for two way measurements
    in the IP network. However IP network performance are also affected by a set of
    L4-L7 service deployed in the network. Monitoring of these service performance
    in the IP network also plays a vital role in network optimization and application
    layer traffic optimization. This capability is not supported by the existing TWAMP
    protocol. In this document, we extend TWAMP protocol to support service performance
    monitoring and service KPIs calculation. Some of the existing fields in the TWAMP
    protocol are extended to support new modes for calculating these KPIs. A set of
    new messages are added in the control protocol between TWAMP client (session sender)
    and the TWAMP server (session reflector). Services here ranging from Layer 4 to
    Layer 7 services,such as Http based services, Traffic load balancer, DPI, Video
    caching, real time streaming and IPSec. The KPIs MAY be service latency, liveliness
    of an application, number of flows and sessions per service, load balancer statistics.
    There is a separate Draft[I.D-spv-ippm-monitor-implementation- services-kpi] that
    talks about implementation of monitoring these KPIs in the network using TWAMP.
    Monitoring of these KPIs in the service plane with in a network play a vital role
    in optimum usage of network resources and improving the overall performance and
    capacity.</p>"
