abstract:
- content: "<p>Long-term interoperability of protocols is an important goal of the
    network standards process. Part of realizing long-term protocol deployment success
    is the ability to support change. Change can require adjustments such as extension
    to the protocol, modifying usage patterns within the current protocol constraints,
    or a replacement protocol. This document present considerations for protocol designers
    and implementers about applying techniques such as greasing or protocol variability
    as a means to exercise maintenance concepts.</p>"
