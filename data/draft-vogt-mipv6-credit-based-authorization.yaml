abstract:
- content: "<p>The latency associated with Mobile IPv6's Return Routability test can
    have an adverse impact on delay-sensitive applications. Early Binding Updates
    mitigate this issue by already using a new care-of address in parallel with testing
    it. We propose and analyze a credit-based mechanism that prevents misuse of Early
    Binding Updates for amplified flooding attacks and discourages such misuse for
    non-amplified flooding attacks.</p>"
