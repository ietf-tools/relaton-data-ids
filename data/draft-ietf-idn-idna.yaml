abstract:
- content: "<p>Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use
    characters outside the ASCII repertoire. This document defines internationalized
    domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called Internationalizing Domain Names in
    Applications (IDNA) for handling them in a standard fashion. IDNs use characters
    drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters
    to be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called
    host names today. This backward-compatible representation is required in existing
    protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no changes to the existing
    infrastructure. IDNA is only meant for processing domain names, not free text.
