abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes LOWPAN_TCPHC, a scheme for compressing the
    header of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) segments, in order to reduce the
    overhead on low-power and lossy networks. It also specifies the LOWPAN_TCPHC header
    fields for the transmission of TCP segments over IPv6 for Low-power Wireless Personal
    Area Networks (6LoWPAN). In many cases, the 20 bytes of the mandatory TCP header
    can be compressed into as little as 6 bytes.</p>"
