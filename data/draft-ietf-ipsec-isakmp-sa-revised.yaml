abstract:
- content: "<p>ISAKMP/OAKLEY [2][3] is the key management protocol defined by IPSEC
    working to be a framework for authentication, security association negotiation
    and key management. The protocol defines two phases whereby, in the phase 1, the
    peers are authenticates, the security association (SA) for ISAKMP/Oakley, and
    keying material is agreed upon by the peers to secure ISAKMP messages. The phase
    2 is used to negotiate security association for security applications (e.g., IPSEC
    AH and ESP). When perfect forward secrecy is required, phase 2 is also used to
    exchange keying material for the application. However, when perfect forward secrecy
    is not a requirement, the keying material from the phase 1 is used to generate
    session keys for the secure communication applications. The proposal in this document
    is based on the observation that when perfect forward secrecy is not a requirement,
    if application specific SA was negotiated during phase 1, the application can
    start immediately after phase 1. The phase 2 can be used subsequently for key
    refresh on per need bases in the future. Therefore, this proposal reduces startup
    time for communication and improves the efficiency of the protocol. Remark: This
    document is NOT self-contained, it is intended as an addendum to [2][3]. Thus,
    it is best read in conjunction with [2][3].</p>"
