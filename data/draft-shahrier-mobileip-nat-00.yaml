abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose an Internet architecture consisting of large
    number private networks, individually connected to the Internet backbone via NAT-routers.
    Hosts within the same private network can communicate with one another locally,
    and also with hosts in other networks via the Internet backbone. The routers in
    each private network maintain their own local routing state and routers in the
    backbone maintain their own external routing state. More specifically, the routers
    within a particular domain are not cognizant of routes outside that domain.</p>"
