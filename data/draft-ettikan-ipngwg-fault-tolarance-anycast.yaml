- content: "<p>This document describes how fault tolerant anycast service can be achieved
    using IPv6 anycast service. Communication between an anycast client and an anycast
    server is required as indicated in [ANALYSIS]. While, proposed host based anycast
    MLD [HOSTANY] or other anycast group address management scheme is in place for
    this fault tolerant anycast service to take place.</p>"
