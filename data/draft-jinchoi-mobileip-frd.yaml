abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents RA Caching in AP for Fast Router Discovery.
    For seamless handoff, a mobile node MUST quickly discover its new access router.
    In our proposal AP caches Router Advertisement message and sends it to a new mobile
    node as soon as L2 association is made. We present a way for AP to cache necessary
    RA. By putting 'RA Caching' and 'AP Notification' functionality on AP, we get
    the optimized result without IPv6 standard change.</p>"
