abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm. BBR ("Bottleneck
    Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time") uses recent measurements of a transport
    connection's delivery rate, round-trip time, and packet loss rate to build an
    explicit model of the network path. BBR then uses this model to control both how
    fast it sends data and the maximum volume of data it allows in flight in the network
    at any time. Relative to loss-based congestion control algorithms such as Reno
    [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC9438], BBR offers substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks
    with shallow buffers or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays
    for bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding "bufferbloat"). BBR can be implemented
    in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery acknowledgment. Thus far,
    open source implementations are available for TCP [RFC9293] and QUIC [RFC9000].
    This document specifies version 3 of the BBR algorithm, BBRv3.</p>
