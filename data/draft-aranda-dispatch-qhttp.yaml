abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an application level protocol for the standard
    communication of e2e QoS compliance information using a protocol based on Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis for the World Wide Web, and Session
    Description Protocol (SDP). Quality HTTP (Q-HTTP) provides a mechanism for latency,
    jitter, bandwidth an packet loss negotiation and monitoring, alerting whenever
    one of the negotiated conditions is violated. Implementation details on the actions
    to be triggered upon reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol
    are out of scope of this draft, it is application dependant (e.g. increase quality,
    reduce bit-rate) or even network dependant (e.g. change connection's quality profile).</p>"
