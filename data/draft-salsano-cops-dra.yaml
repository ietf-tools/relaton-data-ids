abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new client type for the COPS protocol to
    support dynamic DiffServ resource allocation. The client type supports both the
    Outsourcing and the Provisioning model to achieve a scalable, efficient and flexible
    handling of network resources. The defined client type can be used: i) on the
    interface between an Edge Router (Policy Enforcement Point - PEP) and a Diffserv
    'Bandwidth Broker' (acting as Policy Decision Point -PDP); ii) on the interface
    between a client of a QoS enabled network (acting as PEP) and the access point
    of the network provider (e.g. the Edge Router acting as PDP)</p>"
