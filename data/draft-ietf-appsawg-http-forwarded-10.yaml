abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an HTTP extension header field that allows proxy
    components to disclose information lost in the proxying process, for example,
    the originating IP address of a request or IP address of the proxy on the user-agent-facing
    interface. In a path of proxying components, this makes it possible to arrange
    it so that each subsequent component will have access to, for example, all IP
    addresses used in the chain of proxied HTTP requests. This document also specifies
    guidelines for a proxy administrator to anonymize the origin of a request.</p>"
