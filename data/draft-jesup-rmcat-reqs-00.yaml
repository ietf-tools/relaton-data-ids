abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the Internet,
    in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion collapse. The requirements
    for interactive, point-to-point real time multimedia, which needs by low-delay,
    semi-reliable data delivery, are different from the requirements for bulk transfer
    like FTP or bursty transfers like Web pages, and the TCP algorithms are not suitable
    for this traffic. This document attempts to describe a set of requirements that
    can be used to evaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to figure
    out their fitness for this purpose, and in particular to provide a set of possible
    requirements for proposals coming out of the RMCAT Working Group. This document
    is derived from draft-jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs [I-D.jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs].</p>"
