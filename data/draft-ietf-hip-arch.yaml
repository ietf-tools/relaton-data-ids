abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a snapshot of the reasoning behind a proposed new
    namespace, the Host Identity namespace, and a new protocol layer, the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP), between the internetworking and transport layers. Herein are presented
    the basics of the current namespaces, their strengths and weaknesses, and how
    a new namespace will add completeness to them. The roles of this new namespace
    in the protocols are defined. The memo describes the thinking of the authors as
    of Fall 2003. The architecture may have evolved since. This document represents
    one stable point in that evolution of understanding. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
