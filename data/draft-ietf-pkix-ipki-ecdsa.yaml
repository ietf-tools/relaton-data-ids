abstract:
- content: "<p>This is the third draft of a profile for specification of Elliptic
    Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys and signatures in Internet Public
    Key Infrastructure X.509 certificates and certificate revocation lists. This specification
    is an addendum to RFC 2459; implementations must also conform to RFC 2459. In
    addition, this document references ANSI X9.62 for the specification of the ECDSA
    algorithm. This specification only addresses the format of ECDSA keys and signatures.
    Please send comments on this document to the ietf-pkix@imc.org mail list.</p>"
