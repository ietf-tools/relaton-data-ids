abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol which allows various Layer 2 and
    Layer 3 protocols to be tunneled through an IP network. VTP does not specify any
    change to the protocol to be tunneled. It describes the mechanisms for dynamically
    establishing and maintaining secure IP tunnels, and carrying multiprotocol data
    over those tunnels. VTP can be used in the implementation of Virtual Private Networks
    (VPNs). A client-server architecture is defined in order to decouple functions
    which exist in the tunnel initiation node and those in the tunnel termination
    node. This protocol can be implemented in network devices such as network access
    servers, routers and application servers. VTP specifies a Mobile IP-like message
    exchange protocol to create and manage IP tunnel sessions dynamically. VTP uses
    the GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) mechanism to encapsulate multi-protocol
    payload traffic.</p>"
