abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the communication between an application server
    and media server. The current work in SIPPING and XCON working groups show these
    logical functions but do not address the physical decomposition and the protocol
    between the entities. The document presents the architecture and the requirements
    from the protocol. The document lists current work that is relevant to the problem.</p>"
