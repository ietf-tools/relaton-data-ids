abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the syntax and semantics for the Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) content constraints X.509 certificate extension. This extension
    is used to determine whether the public key in an X.509 public key certificate
    is appropriate to use in the processing of a protected content. In particular,
    the CMS content constraints certificate extension is one part of the authorization
    decision; it is used when validating a digital signature on a CMS SignedData content
    or validating a message authentication code (MAC) on a CMS AuthenticatedData content
    or CMS AuthEnvelopedData content. The signed or authenticated content type is
    identified by an ASN.1 object identifier, and this certificate extension indicates
    the content types that the certified public key is authorized to validate. If
    the authorization check is successful, the CMS content constraints certificate
    extension also provides default values for absent attributes.</p>"
