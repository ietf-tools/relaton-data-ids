abstract:
- content: "<p>The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture describes a type of
    challenged network in which communications may be significantly affected by long
    signal propagation delays, frequent link disruptions, or both. The unique characteristics
    of this environment require a unique approach to network management that can support
    asynchronous transport, autonomous local control, and require a very small footprint
    so as to deploy on resource constrained devices. This document describes a DTN
    management architecture (DTNMA) suitable for managing devices in any challenged
    environment but, in particular, those communicating using the DTN Bundle Protocol
    (BPv7). Operating using BPv7 require that the architecture not presume any synchronized
    transport behavior. This means that the DTNMA cannot operate as a query-response
    system across the network. This allows implementations compliant with the DTNMA
    to operate in extremely challenging conditions, such as over uni-directional links
    and other places where BPv7 is the preferred transport.</p>"
