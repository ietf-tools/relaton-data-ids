abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi stages multiplexing configuration requirement is defined in [MULTI-STAGES-MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-REQ]
    document. Multi stages multiplexing configuration framework is diefined in [MULTI-STAGES-
    MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-FRW] document. They describe some scenarios for the interworking
    between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS and the multi-domain OTN applications
    based on the tunnel design. Multi stages multiplexing is desirable to facilitate
    the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without
    having to upgrade every node in the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into
    ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 transit across the 2.5G TS region. Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
    are also used to support the multi-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel
    design. This document describes the RSVP-TE extension for multi stages multiplexing
    configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.</p>"
