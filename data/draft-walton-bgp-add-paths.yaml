abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we propose a BGP extension that allows the advertisement
    of multiple paths for the same address prefix without the new paths implicitly
    replacing any previous ones. The essence of the extension is that each path is
    identified by a path identifier in addition to the address prefix.</p>"
