abstract:
- content: <p>Leap Seconds are part of UTC. NTP timestamps are based on POSIX timestamps,
    which require each day to have exactly 86,400 seconds per day. Some applications
    and environments choose to "smear" leap second corrections over a period that
    can last up to 24 hours' time, and implement NTP servers that offer smeared time
    to clients asking them for the time. Both NTP clients and operators have no current
    way to tell if an NTP server is offering leap-smeared time or not. This is a problem.
    Similarly, an NTP server may choose to offer leap-smeared time to clients that
    do not appear to know that a leap event is in-process. This is a problem. This
    proposal offers a mechanism that provides a simple and clean solution to problems,
    by giving a way that clients (and operators) can trivially ask for leap-smeared
    time and detect a server that is offering leap-smeared time.</p>
