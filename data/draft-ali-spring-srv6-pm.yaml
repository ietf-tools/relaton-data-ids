abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and accurate
    measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics
    such as delay variation and channel throughput in MPLS networks. This document
    describes how these mechanisms can be used for performance measurement of delay
    and loss in Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.</p>"
