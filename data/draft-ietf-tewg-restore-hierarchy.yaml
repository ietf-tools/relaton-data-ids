abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is the deliverable out of the Network Hierarchy and Survivability
    Techniques Design Team established within the Traffic Engineering Working Group.
    This team collected and documented current and near term requirements for survivability
    and hierarchy in service provider environments. For clarity, an expanded set of
    definitions is included. The team determined that there appears to be a need to
    define a small set of interoperable survivability approaches in packet and non-packet
    networks. Suggested approaches include path-based as well as one that repairs
    connections in proximity to the network fault. They operate primarily at a single
    network layer. For hierarchy, there did not appear to be a driving near-term need
    for work on 'vertical hierarchy,' defined as communication between network layers
    such as TDM/optical and MPLS. In particular, instead of direct exchange of signaling
    and routing between vertical layers, some looser form of coordination and communication,
    such as the specification of hold-off timers, is a nearer term need. For 'horizontal
    hierarchy' in data networks, there are several pressing needs. The requirement
    is to be able to set up many LSPs in a service provider network with hierarchical
    IGP. This is necessary to support layer 2 and layer 3 VPN services that require
    edge-to- edge signaling across a core network. Please send comments to te-wg@ops.ietf.org</p>"
