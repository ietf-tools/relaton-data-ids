abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a new DNS-based challenge type for the ACME
    protocol that enables multiple independent systems to authorize a single domain
    name concurrently. By adding a unique label to the DNS validation record name,
    the dns-account-01 challenge avoids CNAME delegation conflicts inherent to the
    dns-01 challenge type. This is particularly valuable for multi-region or multi-cloud
    deployments that wish to rely upon DNS-based domain control validation and need
    to independently obtain certificates for the same domain.</p>"
