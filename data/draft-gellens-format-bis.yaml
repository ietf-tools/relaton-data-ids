abstract:
- content: <p>This specification establishes two parameters (Format and DelSP) to
    be used with the Text/Plain media type. In the presence of these parameters, trailing
    whitespace is used to indicate flowed lines and a canonical quote indicator is
    used to indicate quoted lines. This results in an encoding which appears as normal
    Text/Plain in older implementations, since it is in fact normal Text/Plain, yet
    provides for superior wrapping/flowing, and quoting. This document supersedes
    the one specified in RFC 2646, "The Text/Plain Format Parameter", and adds the
    DelSp parameter to accommodate languages/coded character sets in which ASCII spaces
    are not used or appear rarely. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
