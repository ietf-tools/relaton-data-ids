abstract:
- content: "<p>In an EVPN-IRB based network overlay, EVPN LAG enables all-active multi-homing
    for a host or CE device connected to two or more PEs via a LAG bundle, such that
    bridged and routed traffic from remote PEs can be equally load balanced (ECMPed)
    across the multi-homing PEs. This document defines extensions to EVPN procedures
    to optimally handle unequal access bandwidth distribution across a set of multi-
    homing PEs in order to: o provide greater flexibility, with respect to adding
    or removing individual PE-CE links within the access LAG o handle PE-CE LAG member
    link failures that can result in unequal PE-CE access bandwidth across a set of
    multi-homing PEs</p>"
