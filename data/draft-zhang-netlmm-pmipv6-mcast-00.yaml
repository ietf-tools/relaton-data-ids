abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of various mobile technologies, mobile multicast
    becomes a research hotspot. Several mobile multicast schemes were proposed, but
    most of them are based on the Mobile IPv6 and its alternatives. Recently, the
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) was proposed to provide the mobility support for mobile
    node without mobility function. However, the PMIPv6 mainly concerns on the unicast
    transmission support, and little considers the multicast routing. So, in this
    memo, we propose two mobile multicast mechanisms, the MAG- based method and LMA-based
    method to support the multicast routing in PMIPv6.</p>"
