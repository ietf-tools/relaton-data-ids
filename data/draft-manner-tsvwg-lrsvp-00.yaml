abstract:
- content: "<p>Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reserved resources
    in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if the correspondent node does not support
    QoS, it would be useful to be able to reserve at least local resources at the
    access network, e.g., wireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile nodes
    the continuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signaling or slow re-reservations
    of resources after each handover. This draft proposes a simple enhancement to
    RSVP, so that initial resource reservations and re-reservations, e.g., due to
    host mobility can be done locally in an access network.</p>"
