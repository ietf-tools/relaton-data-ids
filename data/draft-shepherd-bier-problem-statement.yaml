abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to simplify network operations for multicast services.
    Current solutions require a tree-building control plane to build and maintain
    end-to-end tree state per flow, impacting router state capacity and network convergence
    times. Multi-point tree building protocols are often considered complex to deploy
    and debug and may include mechanics from legacy use-cases and/or assumptions which
    no longer apply to the current use-cases. When multicast services are transiting
    a provider network through an overlay, the core network has a choice to either
    aggregate customer state into a minimum set of core states resulting in flooding
    traffic to unwanted network end-points, or to map per-customer, per-flow tree
    state directly into the provider core state amplifying the network-wide state
    problem.</p>"
