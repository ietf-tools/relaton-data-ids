abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to use a media type with the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), a numeric identifier needs to be registered for it, the Content-Format
    number. RFC 7252 defines registration procedures for Content-Format numbers. The
    present document defines a proactive procedure to register a Content-Format number
    for many of the media types that are registered and discusses the benefits and
    limitations of that approach.</p>"
