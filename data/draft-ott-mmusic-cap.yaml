abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a notation for describing potential and specific
    configurations of end systems in multiparty collaboration sessions. The objective
    is to define a configuration description framework that can be used to define
    end system capabilities, to calculate a set of appropriate common capabilities
    based on the descriptions of all (end) systems and to express a selected media
    description for use in session descriptions. One application for this framework
    would be multiparty multimedia conferencing, an application area where multiple
    tools have to be configured on conference startup (and/or during the conference)
    concerning media encoding types and other parameters. Other applications are IP
    Telephony and media gateway control.</p>"
