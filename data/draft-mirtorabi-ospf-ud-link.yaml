abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to support unidirectional links in OSPF
    and addresses its challenges. Unidirectional link routing (UDLR) describes a link-layer
    tunneling mechanism in order to abstract the network layer from unidirectional
    links and makes it transparent to routing protocols. Although this solution can
    be used, it can be cumbersome for user due to configured tunnels and generates
    extra overhead for control packets and encapsulation of tunnels. This document
    proposes the necessary extensions to OSPF in order to support unidirectional links.</p>"
