abstract:
- content: <p>"Traffic Localization" is proposed to release the pressure of backbone
    mobile networks brought by increasing multimedia applications. A universal storage
    protocol is needed to serve the purpose on the edge storage nodes. As the three
    candidates, HTTP, NFS and iSCSI are compared concerning their implementation and
    performance on embeded clients and servers in this paper. Their differences are
    discussed based on the experiment, and our suggestion for universal storage protocols
    on edge storage nodes are put forward.</p>
