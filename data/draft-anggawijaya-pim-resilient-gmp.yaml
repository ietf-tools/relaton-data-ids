abstract:
- content: "<p>Host devices send IGMP or MLD group membership report messages to tell
    the designated router (DR) which multicast groups they want to receive. These
    messages are sent repeatedly up to maximum number of times determined by the 'Robustness
    Variable' setting. However, in certain situations, those messages could get lost.
    This draft proposes a mechanism whereby host devices attached to a local area
    network where the querier and the DR are the same device, can request the querier
    to acknowledge each report message it receives, ensuring report messages reception
    by the DR.</p>"
