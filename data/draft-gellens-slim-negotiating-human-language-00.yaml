abstract:
- content: <p>Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and preferences
    regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. When establishing interactive
    communication ("calls") there needs to be a way to negotiate (communicate and
    match) the caller's language and media needs with the capabilities of the called
    party. This is especially important with emergency calls, where a call can be
    routed to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or call taker capable of communicating
    with the user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call
    during setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an example,
    when calling a company call center). This document describes the need and expected
    use, and describes a solution using new SDP stream attributes.</p>
