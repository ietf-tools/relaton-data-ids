abstract:
- content: "<p>Continuity Check, Proactive Connectivity Verification, and Remote Defect
    Indication functionalities are required for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). Continuity Check monitors a Label Switched
    Path for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity Verification augments Continuity
    Check in order to provide confirmation that the desired source is connected to
    the desired sink. Remote Defect Indication enables an end point to report, to
    its associated end point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on a pseudowire,
    Label Switched Path, or Section. This document specifies specific extensions to
    Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) and methods for proactive Continuity
    Check, Continuity Verification, and Remote Defect Indication for MPLS-TP pseudowires,
    Label Switched Paths, and Sections using BFD as extended by this memo. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
