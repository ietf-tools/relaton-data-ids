abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for TCP. In
    the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network, TCP uses loss
    as an indication of congestion. One of the ways TCP detects loss is using the
    arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments. However, this heuristic is not always
    correct, notably in the case when network paths reorder segments (for whatever
    reason), resulting in degraded performance. TCP-NCR is designed to mitigate this
    degraded performance by increasing the number of duplicate acknowledgments required
    to trigger loss recovery, based on the current state of the connection, in an
    effort to better disambiguate true segment loss from segment reordering. This
    document specifies the changes to TCP, as well as the costs and benefits of these
    modifications.</p>"
