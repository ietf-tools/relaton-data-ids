abstract:
- content: "<p>Spam, defined as the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages, has
    plagued Internet email. Unfortunately, spam is not limited to email. It can affect
    any system that enables user-to-user communications. The Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) defines a system for user-to- user multimedia communications. Therefore,
    it is susceptible to spam, just as email is. In this document, we analyze the
    problem of spam in SIP. We first identify the ways in which the problem is the
    same and the ways in which it is different from email. We then examine the various
    possible solutions that have been discussed for email and consider their applicability
    to SIP. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
