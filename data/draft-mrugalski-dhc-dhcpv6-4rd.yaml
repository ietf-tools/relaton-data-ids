abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies DHCPv6 options which are meant to be used by
    4rd Customer Edge (CE) to obtain necessary parameters to configure their 4rd automatic
    tunnels. The 4rd architecture is defined in [I-D.despres-intarea-4rd]. Since specification
    of 4rd is still expected to evolve, DHCPv6 options may have to evolve too to fit
    the revised 4rd specification.</p>"
