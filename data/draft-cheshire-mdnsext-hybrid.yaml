abstract:
- content: "<p>Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Multicast DNS allows
    discovery only of services present on the local link. Using a very large local
    link with thousands of hosts improves service discovery, but at the cost of large
    amounts of multicast traffic. Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely
    Unicast DNS is more efficient, but requires configuration of DNS Update keys on
    the devices offering the services, which can be onerous for simple devices like
    printers and network cameras. Hence a compromise is needed, that provides easy
    service discovery without requiring either large amounts of multicast traffic
    or onerous configuration.</p>"
