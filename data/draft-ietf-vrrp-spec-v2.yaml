abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). VRRP
    specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual
    router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP router controlling the IP
    address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master, and forwards
    packets sent to these IP addresses. The election process provides dynamic fail
    over in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become unavailable. This
    allows any of the virtual router IP addresses on the LAN to be used as the default
    first hop router by end-hosts. The advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher
    availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or
    router discovery protocols on every end-host. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
