abstract:
- content: "<p>Many services that require DIAMETER need retransmission and timeout
    faster than TCP can provide. An example would be in a NAS environment where DIAMETER
    is used for the authentication and authorization of users. The amount of time
    that it takes for TCP to determine that a connection to a server is broken is
    longer than the disonnect timeout of the PPP clients on whose behalf the server
    is being contacted. RADIUS has been able to handle this situation by operating
    over UDP. However, RADIUS fails to define a standard retransmission and timeout
    scheme, which has resulted in many different methods across implementations. This
    DIAMETER specification defines the extensions necessary for the base protocol
    to operate over a non-reliable transport (e.g. UDP).</p>"
