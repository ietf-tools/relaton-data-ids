abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo contains the thoughts and recountings of events that transpired
    during and after the release of information about the NSA by Edward Snowden. There
    are four perspectives: that of someone who was involved with sifting through the
    information to responsibly inform the public, a security area director of the
    IETF, a human rights expert, and of a computer science and law expert. The purpose
    of this memo is to provide some historical perspective, while at the same time
    offering a view as to what security and privacy challenges the technical community
    should consider.</p>"
