abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new HTTP header that allows web host operators
    to instruct user agents to remember the hosts' request for DANE (DNS-Based Authentication
    of Named Entities) validation over a period of time. During that time, UAs will
    require that the host presents a certificate chain that will authenticate the
    Transport Layer Security connection using DANE. By having hosts explicitly state
    that they have adopted DANE, UAs will only expend resources attempting DANE validation
    on hosts that request it. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the
    author</p>"
