abstract:
- content: "<p>It is a general case in operators networks that Authenticator is deployed
    on Service Gateway (SGW) to avoid overload on the Access Controller (AC). In this
    scenario, the encryption/decryption node can't obtain Pairwise Master Key (PMK)
    information during Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) procedure, it is not
    sufficent to achieve traffic encryption/decryption requirement in Wireless Local
    Area Network (WLAN) network. This document analyzes the requirement and issue
    for key management that has arisen so far during authentication process in WLAN
    network. Meanwhile, the control messages for key management are defined.</p>"
