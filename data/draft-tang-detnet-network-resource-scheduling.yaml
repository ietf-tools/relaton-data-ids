abstract:
- content: "<p>Massive data processing and complex algorithm applications in the industrial
    Internet require a large amount of computing resources. At the same time, real-time
    control requirements and production safety requirements require network reliability
    and certainty. This draft proposes a service-oriented task process processing
    framework, which divides the execution process of services into two stages, namely
    resource orchestration of task flow and packet transmission scheduling. In order
    to obtain the optimal scheduling strategy, a constrained optimization problem
    is developed, which aims to maximize the success rate of transmission scheduling
    while compromising load balancing and resource utilization. In order to improve
    the reliability of the network, the TSN-5G converged network architecture is used
    to transmit data packets.</p>"
