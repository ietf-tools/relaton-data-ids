abstract:
- content: "<p>In a nested mobile network situation, the packet transfer route between
    a correspondent node(CN) and a mobile node(MN) may become much longer than in
    the simple Mobile IP case, because packets can reach endpoints through all of
    the home agents (HAs) to which the mobile routers (MRs) and the MN belong. The
    existing route optimization function of Mobile IPv6 cannot solve this problem,
    because while it can bypass an MN's HA, it cannot skip the MRs' HAs. Furthermore,
    there is no route optimization method for communication nodes without Mobile IPv6
    functionality, which are the so-called local fixed nodes (LFNs) within a mobile
    network. This draft provides solutions to achieve route optimization in these
    situations by using HMIP technology and proxy Mobile IP functions.</p>"
