abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methods to leverage Y.1731 [2] Protocol Data
    Units (PDU) and procedures (state machines) to provide a set of Operation, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms that meets the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    OAM requirements as defined in [8]. In particular, this document describes the
    MPLS-TP technology specific encapsulation mechanisms to carry these OAM PDUs within
    MPLS-TP packets to provide MPLS-TP OAM capabilities in MPLS-TP networks.</p>"
