abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many requirements of developing internationalized and human-readable
    Internet identifiers/names now, thereby there are many systems based on DNS technology
    to meet such requirements. John C. Klensin has proposed a three-layer search-based
    access model for the DNS [DNSSEARCH]; this paper is only to explain some related
    problems mentioned in John C. Klensin's proposal. Especially it focuses on Traditional
    and Simplified Chinese problems and some other special Chinese requirements. The
    ultimate goal for any kinds of search-based access system is to help users to
    access network resources in more natural ways, which have different meaning for
    different user groups. On the premise of respecting Chinese user's language convention,
    it is very important for a valuable and human-friendly system to deal with traditional
    and simplified Chinese equivalence problems.</p>"
