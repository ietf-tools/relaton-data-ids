abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of mechanisms have been proposed to support differential Qualiy
    of Service for packets in the Internet. DiffServ is an example of such a mechanism.
    However, the level of assurance that can be provided with DiffServ without substantial
    over-provisioning is limited. Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) uses path congestion
    information across a PCN region to enable per-flow admission control to provide
    the required service guarantees for the admitted traffic. While admission control
    will protect the QoS under normal operating conditions, an additional flow termination
    mechanism is necessary to cope with extreme events (e.g. route changes due to
    link or node failure). In order to allow the PCN mechanisms to work it is necessary
    for IP packets to be able to carry the pre-congestion information to the PCN egress
    nodes. This document explores different ways in which this information can be
    encoded into IP packets. This document does not choose the encoding but provide
    guidance and recommendation based on different criteria. This document also provides
    a historical trace of the consideration on different encoding alternatives for
    Pre- Congestion Notification.</p>"
