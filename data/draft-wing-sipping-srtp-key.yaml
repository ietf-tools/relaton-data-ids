abstract:
- content: "<p>Call recording is an important feature in enterprise telephony applications.
    Some industries such as financial traders have requirements to record all calls
    in which customers give trading orders. This poses a particular problem for Secure
    RTP systems as many SRTP key exchange mechanisms do not disclose the SRTP session
    keys to intermediate SIP proxies. As a result, these key exchange mechanisms cannot
    be used in environments where call recording is needed. This document specifies
    a secure mechanism for a cooperating endpoint to disclose its SRTP master keys
    to an authorized party to allow secure call recording.</p>"
