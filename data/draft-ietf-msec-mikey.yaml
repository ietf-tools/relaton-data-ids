- content: "<p>This document describes a key management scheme that can be used for
    real-time applications (both for peer-to-peer communication and group communication).
    In particular, its use to support the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol is described
    in detail. Security protocols for real-time multimedia applications have started
    to appear. This has brought forward the need for a key management solution to
    support these protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
