abstract:
- content: "<p>To protect an Explicit Routed Label Switched Path (ER-LSP) an explicitly
    routed LSP can be used as a recovery path. We consider a repair scheme where a
    Recovery LSP (R-LSP) spans one or several hops. After a switchover of traffic
    to the R-LSP we want to allow the traffic to merge onto the original LSP at the
    merging node downstream of the fault without causing any extra resource reservation.
    This merge operation differs in a number of details from that employed for a normal
    MP2P LSP. Our objective is to define extensions to both CR-LDP and RSVP-TE that
    address these differences. CR-LDP and RSVP-TE are defined in [CR-LDP] and [RSVP-TE],
    respectively, for path setup within a MPLS domain. In this draft we specify mechanisms
    required to support this merge.</p>"
