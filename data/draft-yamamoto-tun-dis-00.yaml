abstract:
- content: "<p>Tunnel Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement to the Softwire feature.
    Defining a dynamic tunnel endpoint map allows you to be able to dynamically determine
    a Tunnel Broker peer; however, only the receiving client has this ability. This
    document frets out the problem scope as well as the motivation for specifying
    such a feature within the Softwire protocol.</p>"
