abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a general method to avoid loops while setting
    up Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and is applicable to both unicast and multicast
    label setup. The approach taken is to solve the problem of constructing a tree
    for delivering data. The solution verifies the path towards the root of the tree
    is loop free before a node is grafted to the tree. This loop avoidance scheme
    complements loop detection in LDP.</p>"
