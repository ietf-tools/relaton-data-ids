abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the behavior of signaling intermediaries in
    Real-Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border
    Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT). HNT is a set of
    mechanisms, such as media relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use
    to enable other RTC devices behind NATs to communicate with each other. This document
    is non-normative and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference
    to the Internet community and an informative description to manufacturers and
    users. Latching, which is one of the HNT components, has a number of security
    issues covered here. Because of those, and unless all security considerations
    explained here are taken into account and solved, the IETF advises against use
    of the latching mechanism over the Internet and recommends other solutions, such
    as the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol.</p>"
