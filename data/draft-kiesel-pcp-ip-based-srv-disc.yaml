abstract:
- content: "<p>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how
    incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network Address Translator
    IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network Address Translator IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6 and IPv4
    firewall devices, and a mechanism to reduce application keep alive traffic. This
    document establishes a well-known IP address for the PCP Server and documents
    how PCP clients embedded in endpoints can use it during the discovery and regular
    operation phases.</p>"
