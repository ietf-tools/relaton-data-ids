abstract:
- content: "<p>Network access authentication is a function that is typically required
    in most scenarios. This is accomplished in most networks via protocols such as
    PPP, PPPoE, IEEE 802.1X and others. The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication
    for Network Access) WG is considering the network access authentication function
    being performed at or above the IP layer. This document captures the various usage
    scenarios/applicability of a protocol that is used for network access authentication
    that is at layer-3 or above and additionally identifies the problem being addressed
    by the WG.</p>"
