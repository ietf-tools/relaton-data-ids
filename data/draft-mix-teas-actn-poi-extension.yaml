abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability to
    the use case where the DWDM optical coherent interface is equipped on the Packet
    device. It identifies the YANG data models being defined by the IETF to support
    this deployment architecture and specific scenarios relevant for Service Providers.
    Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each multi-layer (packet
    over optical) scenario with a specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service
    Coordinator to Provisioning Network Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.</p>"
