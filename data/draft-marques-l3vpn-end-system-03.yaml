abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Service Providers often use BGP/MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364] as the
    control plane for overlay networks. That solution has proven to scale to large
    number of VPNs and attachment points and is one familiar to network equipment
    software. There is a significant interest in the industry in building overlay
    networks in which end-systems are themselves the direct participant, along with
    network equipment such as service appliances. This document proposes an extension
    of the BGP IP VPN model to serve as the signaling protocol for host-based overlay
    networks along with an XMPP interface that provides a bridge between the software
    concepts familiar to end-points and those familiar to network equipment.</p>"
