abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a problem statement for IP Wireless Access in
    Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE), that is, vehicular networks. This document addresses
    the extension of IPv6 as the network layer protocol in vehicular networks. It
    deals with networking issues in one-hop communication between a Road-Side Unit
    (RSU) and a vehicle, that is, "vehicle-to-infrastructure" (V2I) communication.
    It also deals with one-hop communication between two neighboring vehicles, that
    is, "vehicle-to-vehicle" (V2V) communication. Major issues about IPv6 in vehicular
    networks include neighbor discovery protocol, stateless address autoconfiguration,
    and DNS configuration for Internet connectivity. When a vehicle and an RSU have
    an internal network (respectively), the document discusses internetworking issues
    between two internal networks through either V2I or V2V communication. Those issues
    include prefix discovery, prefix exchange, service discovery, security, and privacy.</p>
