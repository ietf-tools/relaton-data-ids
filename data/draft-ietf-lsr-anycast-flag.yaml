abstract:
- content: "<p>Both SR-MPLS prefix-SID and IPv4 prefix may be configured as anycast
    and as such the same value can be advertised by multiple routers. It is useful
    for other routers to know that the advertisement is for an anycast identifier.
    Each prefix is advertised along with an 8-bit field of capabilities,by using the
    flag flield in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV, but the definition of anycast flag
    to identify the prefix as anycast has not yet been defined. This document defines
    a new flag in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV Flags to advertise the anycast property.</p>"
