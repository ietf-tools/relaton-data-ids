abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an algorithm here called Arcfour that is believed
    to be fully interoperable with the RC4 algoritm. RC4 is trademark of RSA Data
    Security, Inc. There is a need in the Internet community for an encryption algorithm
    that provides interoperable operation with existing deployed commercial cryptographic
    applications. This interoperability will allow for a smoother transition to protocols
    that have been developed through the IETF standards process.</p>"
