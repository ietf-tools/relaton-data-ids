abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an architecture and selection process for providing
    local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in the event of a single link
    or node failure until the router has converged. When computing the primary next-hop
    for a prefix, a router S also determines an alternate next-hop which can be used
    if the primary next-hop fails. The alternate next-hop is said to be a loop-free
    alternate, which goes to a neighbor whose shortest path to the prefix does not
    go back through the router S.</p>"
