abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a key management protocol variant for the Multimedia
    Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol that relies on a trusted key management service.
    In particular, this variant utilizes Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange
    (IBAKE) framework that allows the participating clients to perform mutual authentication
    and derive a session key in an asymmetric Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) framework.
    This protocol, in addition to providing mutual authentication, eliminates the
    key escrow problem that is common in standard IBE and provides perfect forward
    and backward secrecy. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
