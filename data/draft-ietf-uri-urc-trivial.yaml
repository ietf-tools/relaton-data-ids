abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a trivial, machine-parsable Uniform Resource
    Citiation (URC) syntax that can be returned from the resolution of Uniform Resource
    Names (URNs). The syntax, called urc0, is also appropriate for any program that
    can return URCs. More sophisticated URC schemes will be developed later. urc0
    is intended to be the simplest possible machine-parsable representation of a URC.
    This document does not cover any specific resolution schemes or the syntax for
    URNs. It is expected that these issues (and other URN-related topics) will be
    covered in different Internet Drafts submitted to the IETF URI Working Group.</p>"
