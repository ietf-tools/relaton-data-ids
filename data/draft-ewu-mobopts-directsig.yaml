abstract:
- content: "<p>In Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes must complete Return Routability Procedure
    and binding process before route optimization for data packet transmission is
    performed. This requires signaling exchange between the mobile and correspondent
    node. For the current specification, signaling is restricted to be routed to the
    mobile's and correspondent node's home addresses. This document describes a mechanism
    to enable mobile and correspondent nodes to send the signaling packets directly
    to their care-of addresses.</p>"
