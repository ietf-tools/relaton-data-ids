abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new CoAP response code, 2.06 Pending. A CoAP
    server can use this response code to signal that it has accepted the request but
    has not yet started processing it or that processing the request will take longer
    than a client is typically willing to wait for a response. A 2.06 response can
    include status information and indicate a location where the result will become
    available.</p>"
