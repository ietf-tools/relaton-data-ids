abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes expected host behavior in a network that has more
    than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that implements BCP 38
    filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from. This may interact
    with source address selection in a given implementation, but logically follows
    it - given that the network or host is or appears to be multihomed with PA addresses,
    the host has elected to use source address in a given prefix, and some but not
    all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their RA PIOs, to which
    router should a host present its transmission?</p>"
