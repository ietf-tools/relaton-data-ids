abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet Protocol continues to increase in popularity as a global
    communication system, it becomes increasingly valuable to be able to use familiar
    IP tools such as ftp for local communication as well. For example, two people
    with laptop computers with built-in wireless Ethernet may meet and wish to exchange
    files. It is desirable for these people to be able to use IP application software
    without the inconvenience of having to manually configure static IP addresses
    or set up a DHCP [RFC 2131] server. This draft describes a method by which a host
    may automatically configure an interface with an IP address in the 169.254/16
    range that is valid for link-local communication on that interface. This is especially
    valuable in environments where no other configuration mechanism is available.</p>"
