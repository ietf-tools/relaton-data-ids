abstract:
- content: "<p>The Authorized Firewall Control Protocol provides an interface that
    allows network entities to request firewall and NAT services and resources. It
    is an instance of a protocol that provides authorizations and other security servcies,
    and interworks with other such instances. AFWC uses its authorization facilities
    to provide network administrators more control over network border admissions
    decisions than is provided by other firewall pinholing protocols.</p>"
