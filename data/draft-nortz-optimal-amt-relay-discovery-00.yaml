abstract:
- content: <p>One of the obstacles to implementing AMT Multicast in a multi- network
    environment is the difficulty an AMT Gateway may have in finding an AMT Relay
    that is optimal. Optimal in this context means that the AMT Relay has multicast
    connectivity to the Source, and its location minimizes the unicast (tunneled)
    portion of the path to the Gateway. Blind use of the global anycast address specified
    for AMT Relays in "Automatic IP Multicast Without Explicit Tunnels (AMT)" (RFC
    7450) could result in reaching an AMT Relay that does not have multicast connectivity
    to the source, which would yield a failure to obtain the multicast content; or
    it could result in reaching an AMT Relay that is otherwise less than optimal.
    This document proposes a method for implementing standard DNS procedures so that
    an AMT Gateway using normal DNS queries can virtually always find the optimal
    AMT Relay for a given Source..</p>
