abstract:
- content: "<p>In a mobile network, when a mobile device (referred to as User Equipment
    or UE) moves from one Access Node (source AN) to another (target AN), the anchoring
    node that connects the UE to the Data Network sends an End Marker to the source
    AN after it starts sending UE traffic towards the target AN. The target AN buffers
    the data until it receives the End Marker forwarded by the source AN. This is
    to preserve the order of packets during the handover between ANs. The anchoring
    node is referred to as User Plane Function (UPF) in 5G and it is a Network Function
    of the mobile network. The UPFs are traditionally centrally deployed but are more
    and more distributed closer to the edge. With distributed UPFs, handover becomes
    necessary among UPFs, and the End Marker mechanism may need to be extended to
    Data Network devices that are not mobile network functions. This document discusses
    the problem and proposes a solution based on ICMP messages if packet ordering
    needs to be preserved during handover between UPFs.</p>"
