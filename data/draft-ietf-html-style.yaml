abstract:
- content: "<p>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used
    to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another.
    HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate
    for representing information from a wide range of applications. This specification
    extends HTML to provide support for style rules expressed in separately specified
    notations. It is no longer necessary to extend HTML when new style are needed.
    Style rules can be (a) included with individual HTML elements to which they apply,
    (b) grouped together in the document head, or (c) placed in associated style sheets.
    This specification does not specify particular style sheet notations, leaving
    that to other specifications.</p>"
