abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines requirements for extending the BGP Monitoring
    Protocol (BMP) to provide comprehensive monitoring of RPKI-related processes on
    routers, including data retrieval from RPKI caches, policy configuration, route
    validation, and the impact of validation on routing decisions. The proposed extensions
    aim to standardize RPKI monitoring within BMP, addressing scalability and interoperability
    limitations in existing implementations.</p>"
