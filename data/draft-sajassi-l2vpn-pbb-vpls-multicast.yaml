abstract:
- content: "<p>The scalability of H-VPLS (either with MPLS or Ethernet access network)
    can be improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) functionality
    in VPLS access. The ingress replication of PBB multicast traffic can be further
    improved by replicating such traffic over a subset of PWs for which there are
    receivers interested in that PBB multicast group. This document discusses the
    use of BGP for distribution of PBB multicast addresses (e.g., auto-discovery of
    these addresses) and applying multicast pruning to a VPLS instance for efficient
    ingress replication.</p>"
