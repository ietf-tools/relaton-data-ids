abstract:
- content: "<p>The updated DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM2) permits an organization
    that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating
    the domain with the message through a digital signature. This is done by publishing
    to Domain Name Service (DNS) of the domain a public key that is then associated
    to the domain and where messages can be signed by the corresponding private key.
    Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and
    by querying the Signerâ€™s domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key.
    This document describes DKIM2 DNS record format and how to find the record.</p>"
