abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we present Architecture and Framework for Wireless
    VPN services. The wireless VPN services discussed here focus on mobility users
    of GSM and 3G services. This document does not discuss Wireless LAN services provided
    by 802.11 standard. In this document wireless VPN services are presented as a
    VPN service with special requirements, underlying physical layer characteristics
    are considered out of scope. The purpose of the document is to initiate the discussion
    on WVPN with the possibility of expanding the PPVN charter to include WVPN.</p>"
