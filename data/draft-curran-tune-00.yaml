abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a strategy for providing TCP and UDP services over
    _multiple_ network services in a manner compatible with existing TCP/IP applications.
    By introducing network-independent endpoint identifiers for transport entities,
    TUNE makes it possible to change network addresses (and potentially network protocols)
    without impact to the application layer. While this paper describes the use of
    Connection-Less Network Protocol [1] as a possible long-term network service for
    the Internet, the overall approach differs from the 'TCP &amp; UDP with Bigger
    Addresses' [2] initiative due to the addition of network-independent endpoint
    identifiers. TUNE also provides network layer programming interfaces which are
    unchanged from those of the current Internet Protocol (IP) suite and hence alleviate
    the need for application code changes during initial deployment. Comments should
    be sent to the author (jcurran@nic.near.net).</p>"
