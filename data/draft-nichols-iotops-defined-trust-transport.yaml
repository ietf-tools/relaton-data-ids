abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification and
    does not enjoy IETF consensus. It is published for examination, evaluation, and
    experimentation. The Defined-trust Transport (DeftT) framework is designed to
    provide default-deny communications for certain types of Limited Domains (RFC8799)
    used for Operational Technology (OT) networks and, in particular, Critical Infrastructure
    networking. DeftT is designed to express and enforce application- and deployment-specific
    integrity, authentication, access control and behavior constraints directly in
    its protocol modules. It enables secure and completely self-contained (e.g., no
    external identity servers or certificate authorities) overlay networks where credentialed
    members can join and leave at any time. Security is not optional and members preconfigured
    only with their individual cryptographically secured identities and the secured
    communication rules independently authenticate other members' identities and their
    role- and attribute-specific communications. DeftT is an integrated trust management,
    multi-party transport that synchronizes collections of secured information across
    all members of its domain. It uses a many-to-many synchronization primitive rather
    than source-destination send-and-acknowledgement. Packets are not routable and
    information only leaves its originating subnet if it is both explicitly permitted
    in the secured rules and there is a member element (relay) constructed to move
    validated information containers across subnets. DeftT provides default deny networking
    for closed communities with dynamic membership and a collection-based transport
    that is efficient on broadcast media. DeftT is part of a Defined- trust Communications
    approach with an example implementation available. Combined with IPv6 multicast
    and modern hardware-based methods for securing keys and code, it can provide a
    foundation for secure and efficient communications in Limited Domains, particularaly
    in Critical Infrastructure domains.</p>"
