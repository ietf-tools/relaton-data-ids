abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP [1] agents are being deployed in enterprise networks, to
    enable mobile users with network mobility across wired and wireless LANs while
    roaming inside the enterprise firewall. With the growing deployment of multi-subnetted
    IEEE 802.11 networks (referred as hot spots) in public places such as hotels,
    airports, and convention centers, and wireless WAN data networks such as GPRS,
    the need for enabling mobile users to maintain their transport connections and
    constant reachability while connecting back to their target 'home' networks protected
    by VPNs is increasing. This draft identifies example usage scenarios for enterprise
    users roaming outside the firewall, and defines a problem statement based on the
    scenarios.</p>"
