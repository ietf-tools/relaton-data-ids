abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSCP specification defined in RFC 2560 requires server responses
    to be signed but does not specify a mechanism for selecting the signature algorithm
    to be used leading to possible interoperability failures in contexts where multiple
    signature algorithms are in use. This document specifies an algorithm for server
    signature algorithm selection and an extension that allows a client to advise
    a server that specific signature algorithms are supported.</p>"
