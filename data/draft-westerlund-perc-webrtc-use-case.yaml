abstract:
- content: "<p>The work so far on Privacy Enhanced RTP Conferencing, which allows
    end-to-end security also in centralized switched RTP based conferences, has not
    considered WebRTC in detail. This document looks at the use case of WebRTC based
    endpoints, it also considers implications of using external providers for both
    conference applications and centralized media distribution devices. From this
    a number of challenges have been determined, and requirements are derived from
    these. Finally the draft presents some straw man for possible solutions.</p>"
