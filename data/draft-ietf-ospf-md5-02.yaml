abstract:
- content: "<p>Growth in the Internet has made us aware of the need for improved authentication
    of routing information. OSPF provides two authentication mechanisms for use in
    an area: 'No Authentication' and 'Simple Password'. Both are vulnerable to passive
    attacks currently widespread in the Internet. Well-understood security issues
    exist in routing protocols [4]. Clear text passwords, currently specified for
    use with OSPF, are no longer considered sufficient [5]. If authentication is disabled,
    then only simple misconfigurations are detected. Simple passwords transmitted
    in the clear will further protect against the honest neighbor, but are useless
    in the general case. By simply capturing information on the wire - straightforward
    even in a remote environment - a hostile process can learn the password and overcome
    the network.</p>"
