abstract:
- content: <p>This document explains the need for network instrumentation that allows
    to assess a number of sustainability-related attributes such as power consumption,
    energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated with a network, its equipment,
    and the services that are provided over it. It also suggests a set of related
    metrics that, when provided visibility into, can help to optimize a network's
    "greenness" accordingly.</p>
