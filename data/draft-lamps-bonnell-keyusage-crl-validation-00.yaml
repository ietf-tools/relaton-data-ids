abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5280 defines the profile of X.509 certificates and certificate
    revocation lists (CRLs) for use in the Internet. This profile requires that certificates
    which certify keys for signing CRLs contain the key usage extension with the cRLSign
    bit asserted. Additionally, RFC 5280 defines steps for the validation of CRLs.
    While there is a requirement for CRL validators to verify that the cRLSign bit
    is asserted in the keyUsage extension of the CRL issuer's certificate, there is
    no requirement for validators to verify the presence of the keyUsage extension
    itself. The lack of this requirement may manifest in an issue in some Public Key
    Infrastructures where a CRL issuer who has been certified by a Certification Authority
    to issue CRLs on its behalf can sign CRLs using a key that has not been certified
    for signing CRLs. This document specifies an enhancement to the CRL validation
    process to explicitly require the presence of the keyUsage extension to resolve
    this issue.</p>"
