abstract:
- content: "<p>Many solutions have been proposed to enable automatically switched
    transport networks (ASTN). This document describes a control plane architecture
    that can be applied to different packet and circuit switching technologies (including
    fiber, waveband, wavelength, PDH, and SONET/SDH). The control plane technology
    is based on IP/MPLS control plane protocols. As such, this document is based on
    the concepts introduced in [MPLambdas] and [GMPLS-SIG] from an architectural perspective.
    It also describes how this control plane architecture could facilitate control
    plane integration of networks across technical, administrative, and business domains.
    This memo includes generic procedures, key concepts, and technical considerations
    for the generalized MPLS control plane architecture. It is intended to accentuate
    understanding of the application domains, create architectural alignment, and
    serve as guide for protocol engineering.</p>"
