abstract:
- content: "<p>Dissemination of the Traffic flow information was first introduced
    in the BGP protocol [RFC5575]. FlowSpec rules are used to distribute traffic filtering
    rules that are used to filter Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. For the networks
    that only deploy IS-IS or IS-IS variant, it is required that IS-IS is extended
    to distribute Flow Specification or FlowSpec rules. This document discusses the
    use cases for distributing flow specification (FlowSpec) routes using IS-IS. Furthermore,
    this document defines a new IS-IS FlowSpec Reachability TLV encoding format that
    can be used to distribute FlowSpec rules, its validation procedures for imposing
    the filtering information on the routers, and a capability to indicate the support
    of FlowSpec functionality.</p>"
