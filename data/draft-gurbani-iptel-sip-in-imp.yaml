abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP [1] is an excellent vehicle for the converged network services
    of the future; of that there is no doubt. However, even in the near term, SIP
    is an equally powerful solution to bridge the PSTN and VoIP networks by its application
    to the IN (Intelligent Network) services domain. This Internet Draft details our
    experiences of applying SIP to the said domain. We use a SIP call controller to
    execute IN services by mapping IN call model states to those of the SIP protocol
    state machine [2]. [2] uses the notion of call model integration [3], an example
    of which is to use the IN call model as a canonical call model to map the protocol
    states of IP (Internet Protocol) based call controllers (SIP, H.323,...) to those
    of the IN call model.</p>"
