abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, there have been a variety of proposals submitted to the Mobile
    IP Working Group and to other IETF working groups for IP mobility solutions that
    seek to enhance or replace mobile IP. These proposals, often characterized as
    micromobility or fast handoff, are addressed primarily at the perceived need of
    multimedia sessions such as video or voice over IP for faster handoff between
    radio base stations, and are primarily directed at real time multimedia traffic
    in 3rd generation cellular access networks. In this paper, we discuss the design
    of CDMA radio access networks (RANs) and the applicability of IP mobility to soft
    handoff in a CDMA RAN. We attempt to show that given current IP routing algorithms
    and the constraints on a CDMA RAN, IP mobility solutions have little, if any,
    role to play in handoff within the RAN. In contrast, an IP mobility solution is
    likely to play a big role in fast handoff between RANs, also called hard handoff.
    While future developments in IP networking may change this situation, IP mobility
    in CDMA networks currently seems to apply only when the mobile node roams between
    disconnected RANs rather than between base stations within a RAN or between connected
    RANs.</p>"
