abstract:
- content: <p>The Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is a simple and efficient
    routing protocol designed specifically for use in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks
    of mobile nodes. DSR allows the network to be completely self-organizing and self-configuring,
    without the need for any existing network infrastructure or administration. The
    protocol is composed of the two main mechanisms of "Route Discovery" and "Route
    Maintenance", which work together to allow nodes to discover and maintain routes
    to arbitrary destinations in the ad hoc network. All aspects of the protocol operate
    entirely on demand, allowing the routing packet overhead of DSR to scale automatically
    to only what is needed to react to changes in the routes currently in use. The
    protocol allows multiple routes to any destination and allows each sender to select
    and control the routes used in routing its packets, for example, for use in load
    balancing or for increased robustness. Other advantages of the DSR protocol include
    easily guaranteed loop-free routing, operation in networks containing unidirectional
    links, use of only "soft state" in routing, and very rapid recovery when routes
    in the network change. The DSR protocol is designed mainly for mobile ad hoc networks
    of up to about two hundred nodes and is designed to work well even with very high
    rates of mobility. This document specifies the operation of the DSR protocol for
    routing unicast IPv4 packets. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>
