abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS types have special meaning and are classified as meta queries,
    this includes ANY, AXFR, IXFR. These queries frequently return larger answers
    than queries for other types. This document defines a standard way for Authoritative-Only
    servers how to refuse to serve these and other similar queries, with the expectation
    that resolvers honor that, by not asking followup queries.</p>"
