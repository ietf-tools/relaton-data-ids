abstract:
- content: "<p>The ARPA internet protocol suite -- commonly referred to as TCP/IP
    (after the core protocols, Transmission Control Protocol [1] and Internet Protocol
    [2]) -- is arguably the most widely used, wide area internetworking solution in
    the world today. Availability of on-line documentation, multiple vendor-interoperable
    implementations, and an internationally connected private and commercial infrastructure
    have most recently contributed to remarkable growth in the size of the global
    IP-based Internet. Deployment of IP-based networks and hosts cannot continue at
    the present pace unless certain addressing, protocol and operational limitations
    are corrected. Two problems of immediate concern are: (1) the Internet backbone
    and regional networks suffer from the need to maintain large and growing amounts
    of routing information;and (2) the Internet is gradually running out of IP network
    numbers to assign.</p>"
