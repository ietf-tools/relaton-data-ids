abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
    (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal
    mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated.
    This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement (RA) extension)
    to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive-portal device, and
    that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access. It is not a full solution
    to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is
    designed to be used in larger solutions. The method of authenticating to, and
    interacting with the captive portal is out of scope of this document. [ This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-ekwk-capport-rfc7710bis.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. Text in square brackets will
    be removed before publication. ]</p>"
