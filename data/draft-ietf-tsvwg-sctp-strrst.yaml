abstract:
- content: <p>Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP) want the ability to "reset" a stream. The intention of resetting a stream
    is to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding
    notification to the application layer that the reset has been performed. Applications
    requiring this feature want it so that they can "reuse" streams for different
    purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application
    can track the message flows. Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream
    would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol
    mechanism to "reset the streams back to zero". This document also includes methods
    for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional streams, and
    resetting all stream sequence numbers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
