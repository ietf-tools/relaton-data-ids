abstract:
- content: "<p>The Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) working group is
    considering protocols for an alternative congestion control protocol that enables
    a delay-insensitive networking application to minimize the extra queueing delay
    it causes to other applications because of additional queueing at the bottleneck,
    when these connections carrying traffic for such applications attempt to use the
    available bandwidth. This document proposes an architectural framework for LEDBAT
    congestion control mechanisms, based on existing work on congestion control protocols
    and the requirements of the LEDBAT working group. The architectural framework
    consists of a LEDBAT-congestion control (LEDBAT-CC) suite that provides flexibility
    in utilizing different components for providing congestion control for transport
    connections carrying delay-insensitive traffic. The LEDBAT-CC suite of protocols
    is envisioned to support the multiple alternative mechanisms for bandwidth estimation,
    congestion detection and indication and end- system flow control to comprise a
    network friendly congestion avoidance protocol. This document is inspired by the
    need to standardize the various components that constitute the network friendly
    congestion control protocol to avoid having to individually standardize a multitude
    of distinct and monolithic solutions.</p>"
