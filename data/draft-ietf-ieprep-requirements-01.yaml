abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines user requirements for IP-based networks to enable
    and support an authorized emergency telecommunications service (ETS)for use by
    authorities to organize and coordinate emergency and disaster relief operations.
    It provides a basis from which ETS can be negotiated to provide user-acceptable
    communications. The requirements in this document relate to user expectation and
    are general, functional, and intended to provide wide latitude in implementation
    options. This document also provides in-depth background on the state of emergency
    telecommunication capabilities as they exist today and the motivation for supporting
    these in IP networks. Specific system requirements involving end-to-end and network
    issues are presented in [2].</p>"
