abstract:
- content: "<p>In this note we will present a functional decomposition of the M6 protocol
    i.e. the protocol for preserving established communications in multihomed environments.
    We will do so by describing a protocol walkthrough, presenting which functions
    have to be performed at each stage and the messages required to accomplish them.
    The functional decomposition presented in this draft is based on the general functional
    analysis of multihoming approaches presented in [3].</p>"
