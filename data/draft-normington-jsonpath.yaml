abstract:
- content: "<p>JSONPath defines a string syntax for identifying values within a JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) document. Note *This document is a work in progress and
    has not yet been published as an Internet Draft* (which needs to be fixed soon).
    Contributing This document picks up the popular JSONPath specification dated 2007-02-21
    and provides a normative definition for it. In its current state, it is a strawman
    document showing what needs to be covered. Comments and issues can be directed
    at the github repository _insert repo here_ as well as (for the time when the
    more permanent home is being decided) at the dispatch@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
