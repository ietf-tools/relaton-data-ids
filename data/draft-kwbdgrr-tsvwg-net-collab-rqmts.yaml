abstract:
- content: "<p>Collaborative signaling from client-to-network and server-to-network
    can improve the user experience by informing the network about the nature and
    relative importance of packets (frames, streams, etc.) without having to disclose
    the content of the packets. Moreover, the collaborative signaling may be enabled
    so that clients and servers are aware of the network's treatment of incoming packets.
    Also, client-to-network collaboration can be put in place without revealing the
    identity of the remote servers. This collaboration allows for differentiated services
    at the network (e.g., packet discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission),
    or through cooperation of server/client and the network. This document lists some
    use cases that illustrate the need for a mechanism to share metadata and outlines
    requirements for both client-to-network and server-to-network. The document focuses
    on signaling information about a UDP transport flow (UDP 4-tuple).</p>"
