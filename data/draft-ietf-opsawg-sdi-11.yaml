abstract:
- content: '<p>Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has
    no staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel to the location
    to perform the initial install and configuration, even in shared facilities with
    "remote-hands" type support. In many cases, this could be avoided if there were
    a secure way to initially provision the device. This document extends existing
    vendor proprietary auto-install to make the process more secure. [ Ed note: Text
    inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently
    asked questions, general musings, etc. They will be removed before publication.
    This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-
    wkumari-opsawg-sdi. The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc
    should all be available here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. ]
    [ Ed note: This document introduces concepts and serves as the basic for discussion.
    Because of this, it is conversational, and would need to be firmed up before being
    published ]</p>'
