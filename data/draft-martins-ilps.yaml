abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new, uniform method of mapping IP addresses,
    service identifiers and service-specific info. It does the ame work that is done
    by DNS and URLs. I realize this would be extremally hard to implement, as there
    is already an immense working base of DNS, but the idea provides so much benefits
    that I thought I did not have the right not to post it (so maybe the URN folks
    use it for something).</p>"
