abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies an Ethernet Layer 2 Virtual Private Service Protocol
    using Ethernet addressing hierarchy and service separation. This protocol enables
    Service Providers to deploy an Ethernet Network and offer scalable and manageable
    layer 2 Transparent LAN Services (L2TLS). The primary goal of this protocol is
    to eliminate the need of the Service Provider to manage customer address information
    and forwarding within its network. Another goal is to allow auto provisioning
    of VPN service instances within the Service Provider networks. This solution maintains
    customer benefits of simplicity of access to the VPN, allows efficient utilization
    of Service Provider network resources, and overcomes distance limitations of customer's
    LANs.</p>"
