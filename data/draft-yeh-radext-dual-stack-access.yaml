abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the RADIUS attributes for IPv4 and IPv6 dual
    stack access, which are intended to be used in the AAA processes for the transfer
    of user's configuration from AAA server to NAS and traffic statistics reporting
    from NAS to AAA server. The new attributes cover a specified user type for NAS
    to allocate the proper resource and employ the right mechanism for the users;
    and a batch of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics for the differentiated accounting
    policies on the AAA server.</p>"
