abstract:
- content: "<p>In case multiple distributed (including a possible centralized one)
    flood reduction algorithms are deployed at the same time in an IGP domain the
    correctness of the overall solution preconditions certain co-operative behavior
    of involved algorithms. Under such conditions the correctness of the overall solution
    can be derived from resulting graph theoretical concepts easily. This document
    presents the necessary requirements on the deployed algorithms and the resulting
    framework. The situation of multiple algorithms in the network in steady state
    is per se not necessarily operationally desirable but must be, if minimal network
    disruption during such procedure is required, solved for possible migration scenarios
    caused by e.g. discovered defects or algorithm improvements.</p>"
