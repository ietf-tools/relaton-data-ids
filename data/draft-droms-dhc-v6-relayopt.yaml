abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces the capabilities of the DHCPv4 Relay Agent
    Information Option in RFC 3046 and the corresponding RADIUS- Attributes Sub-option
    to DHCPv6. In particular, the document describes a new DHCPv6 option called the
    Relay Agent Information option which extends the set of DHCPv6 options as defined
    in RFC 3315 and 3376. Following its DHCPv4 counterpart as defined in RFC 3046,
    the new option is inserted by the DHCPv6 relay agent when forwarding client-originated
    DHCPv6 packets to a DHCPv6 server. Servers recognizing the Relay Agent Information
    option may use the information to implement IP address or other parameter assignment
    policies. The DHCP Server echoes the option back verbatim to the relay agent in
    server-to-client replies, and the relay agent strips the option before forwarding
    the reply to the client. The Relay Agent Information option is organized as a
    single DHCPv6 option that contains one or more "sub-options" that convey information
    known by the relay agent. A RADIUS Attributes Sub-option, following its DHCPv4
    counterpart, is also defined.</p>
