abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the expected use of the Provider Independent
    address format discussed in the companion document GEO [1] in the Internet. Several
    parties have expressed interest in using this approach as a good fit for managing
    their networks. With the long timeframe that the shim6 effort will take, this
    approach provides a scalable multi-homing approach for use in the interim. In
    addition to covering implementations where it adds value in managing the growth
    of the Internet routing tables, the document will discuss implementations that
    should be avoided due to the negative impact on the routing tables.</p>"
