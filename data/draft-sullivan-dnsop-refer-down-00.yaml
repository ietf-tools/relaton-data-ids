abstract:
- content: <p>A server in the Domain Name System can use a mechanism called "referral"
    to indicate that the server is not authoritative for a given zone, and to redirect
    the query to another, more appropriate server. The mechanism was originally specified
    such that a referral might be to any location in the DNS. Operational experience
    indicates dubious value to referrals other than those to zones below the zones
    for which a server is authoritative. This memo therefore recommends such referrals
    and discourages other kinds of referrals.</p>
