abstract:
- content: "<p>The Microsoft Windows 2000 implementation of Kerberos introduces a
    new encryption type based on the RC4 encryption algorithm and using an MD5 HMAC
    for checksum. This is offered as an alternative to using the existing DES based
    encryption types. The RC4-HMAC encryption types are used to ease upgrade of existing
    Windows NT environments, provide strong crypto (128-bit key lengths), and provide
    exportable (meet United States government export restriction requirements) encryption.
    The Microsoft Windows 2000 implementation of Kerberos contains new encryption
    and checksum types for two reasons: for export reasons early in the development
    process, 56 bit DES encryption could not be exported, and because upon upgrade
    from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000, accounts will not have the appropriate DES
    keying material to do the standard DES encryption. Furthermore, 3DES is not available
    for export, and there was a desire to use a single flavor of encryption in the
    product for both US and international products. As a result, there are two new
    encryption types and one new checksum type introduced in Microsoft Windows 2000.</p>"
