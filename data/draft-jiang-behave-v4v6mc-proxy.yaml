abstract:
- content: "<p>During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the interoperation
    between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential. Multicast services across
    IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed. Besides the packet-based multicast translation
    mechanism, this document describes a multicast proxy solution. The multicast proxy
    is deployed at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks. It is mainly based on content
    cache concept. Without packet-based translation, it retires the content data from
    IPvX network, caches the data, and multicasts the data in IPvY network. It acts
    as a multicast leaf in the IPvX network where the data source locates. It also
    acts as a multicast source in IPvY network where the multicast client locates.</p>"
