abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the NULL public key algorithm. The original goal
    of this effort was to be able to allow people to optionally sign data, without
    needing the make the signature optional in the ASN.1. While we were at it, we
    decided to, for completeness, also specify the method for NULL public key encryption.</p>"
