abstract:
- content: "<p>Some IPv6 applications obtain IPv4 address literals and want to communicate
    with those IPv4 hosts through an IPv6/IPv4 translator. The IPv6 application can
    send an IPv6 packet through the translator if it knows the IPv6 prefix of the
    IPv6/IPv4 translator. In many IPv6/IPv4 translation deployments, that IPv6 prefix
    is not fixed; rather, the prefix is chosen by the network operator. This specification
    provides three methods for a host to learn the IPv6 prefix of its IPv6/IPv4 translator.
    Unicast, any-source multicast (ASM), and source-specific multicast (SSM) are supported.</p>"
