abstract:
- content: "<p>At present based on a different protocol architecture, 3G wireless
    standards start to become more and more IP-based. The upcoming set of 3G wireless
    specifications defined by 3GPP will include SIP [RFC2543] as the session control
    protocol for IP-based voice and multimedia. An important requirement for introducing
    SIP is the definition of a security architecture protecting the session control
    signaling. This Internet Draft collects requirements for a SIP security architecture
    that are related to the use of SIP in 3GPP wireless networks. It is intended to
    stimulate the discussion about SIP security and is meant as a source of input
    for a requirements draft on SIP security.</p>"
