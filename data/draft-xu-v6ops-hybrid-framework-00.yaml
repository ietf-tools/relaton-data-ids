abstract:
- content: "<p>Global IPv6 deployment is expected. Many solutions have been specified
    in order to provide IPv6 connectivity service. In order to provide IPv6 connectivity
    service to all kinds of host/client devices, ISP networks may need to support
    as many as possible IPv6 connectivity solutions. This document proposes a hybrid
    ISP framework that supports the coexistence of various IPv6 connectivity solutions
    and analyses the configuration requirements raised by this framework. Additionally,
    the applicability of different configuration mechanisms for performing this configuration
    is discussed.</p>"
