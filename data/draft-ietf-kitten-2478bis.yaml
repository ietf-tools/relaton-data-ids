abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a negotiation mechanism for the Generic Security
    Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), which is described in RFC 2743.
    GSS-API peers can use this negotiation mechanism to choose from a common set of
    security mechanisms. If per-message integrity services are available on the established
    mechanism context, then the negotiation is protected against an attacker that
    forces the selection of a mechanism not desired by the peers. This mechanism replaces
    RFC 2478 in order to fix defects in that specification and to describe how to
    inter-operate with implementations of that specification that are commonly deployed
    on the Internet. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
