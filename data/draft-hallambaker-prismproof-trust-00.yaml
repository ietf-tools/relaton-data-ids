abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper extends Shanon's concept of a 'work factor' to provide an
    objective measure of the practical security offered by a protocol or infrastructure
    design. Considering the hypothetical work factor based on an informed estimate
    of the probable capabilities of an attacker with unknown resources provides a
    better indication of the relative strength of protocol designs than the computational
    work factor of the best known attack. The social work factor is a measure of the
    trustworthiness of a credential issued in a PKI based on the cost of having obtained
    the credential through fraud at a certain point in time. Use of the social work
    factor allows evaluation of Certificate Authority based trust models, peer to
    peer (Web of Trust) models to be evaluated in the same framework. The analysis
    shows that each model has clear benefits over the other for some classes of user
    but most classes of user are served better by a combination of both.</p>"
