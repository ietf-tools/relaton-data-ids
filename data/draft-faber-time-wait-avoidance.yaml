abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problems associated with the accumulation
    of TCP TIME_WAIT states at a network server, such as a web server, and details
    two methods for avoiding that accumulation. Servers that have many TCP connections
    in TIME_WAIT state experience performance degradation, and can collapse. One solution
    is a TCP modification that causes clients to enter TIME_WAIT state rather than
    servers. The other is an HTTP modification that allows the client to close the
    transport connection, maintaining the TIME_WAIT state at the client. The goal
    of both approaches is ensure that TIME_WAIT states accumu- late at the less loaded
    endpoint. The document also presents initial performance data from reference implementations
    of these solutions, which suggest that the modifica- tions improve HTTP connection
    rates at the server by as much as 50%, and allow servers to operate at small transaction
    throughputs that they cannot sustain their default configuration.</p>"
