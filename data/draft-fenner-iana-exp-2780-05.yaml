abstract:
- content: "<p>When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary
    to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually test or experiment
    with the new function, even when testing in a closed environment. This document
    reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation purposes in specific protocols
    where the need to support experimentation has been identified, and it describes
    the numbers that have already been reserved by other documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
