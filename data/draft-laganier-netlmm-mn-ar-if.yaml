abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specify an IP layer interface between mobile nodes (MN)
    and access routers (AR) of a network-based localized mobility management (NetLMM)
    domain. Such an interface is subject to a certain number of threats, amongst which
    are attacks on the mapping between the MN Identifier and IPv6 address set. A binding
    enforcement mechanism between those two is hence required to prevent malicious
    nodes to carry on various attacks like service theft or denial-of-service attacks.
    In the absence of link-layer specific mechanisms enforcing this binding, it is
    required to implement such mechanism at the IP layer MN-AR interface. Moreover,
    it is required that no NetLMM specific software support is present on MNs. The
    IP layer MN-AR interface described in this document fulfills these two requirements
    by using the SEND public key as the MN identifier, while being solely based on
    standard track IPv6 protocols (DNA and SEND) implemented by non-NetLMM MNs.</p>"
