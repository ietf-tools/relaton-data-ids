abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting up networks
    so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does not rely on centralized
    deployed anchors to provide IP mobility support. There are many different approaches
    to address Distributed Mobility Management, as for example extending network-based
    mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6), or client-based mobility protocols
    (as Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the former approach, and
    proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in which mobility sessions are
    anchored at the last IP hop router (called mobility anchor and access router).
    The mobility anchor and access router is an enhanced access router which is also
    able to operate as local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway, on a per
    prefix basis. The document focuses on the required extensions to effectively support
    simultaneously anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways. This
    document introduces the concept of distributed logical interface, which is a software
    construct that allows to easily hide the change of anchor from the mobile node.</p>"
