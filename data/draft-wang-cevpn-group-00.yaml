abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec tunneling provides a site-to-site connection when building a
    CE-based IPsec VPN. In a large scale VPN deployment, especially when a service
    provider manages a large number VPNs, there is a need to manage IPsec tunnels
    on a group basis, instead of on a tunnel basis. This document describes the definition
    of a VPN group, its attributes, and usage of VPN group when managing IPsec tunnels.
    By grouping IPsec tunnels and sites into an IPsec VPN group, service providers
    can design, provision, and manage the IPsec-based CE VPN at both group level and
    tunnel/site level. This gives service providers more flexibility and provides
    more aggregation capability to reduce operation complexity.</p>"
