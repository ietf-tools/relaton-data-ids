abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes the end-to-end signaling architecture
    and framework model for transmitting packets through a series of heterogeneous
    networks. The Next-Steps-In-Signaling (NSIS) Working Group is already working
    on defining a set of requirements for the QoS signaling protocol [1]. This document
    is the follow on to the requirements draft, and the precursor to any solutions
    document. It outlines a framework for transporting end-to-end QoS parameters,
    initiated and maintained by the 'Originator' of the service. This draft elaborates
    on the requirements draft. It defines more precisely the scope of NSIS for end-to-end
    packet flows, in terms of QoS Signaling, where the resource reservations for the
    service are initiated by the “Originator” end point and whether this service is
    bi- directional or unidirectional (i.e., receive-only or send-only). The draft
    is fully backward compatible; it requires no changes to the existing QoS signaling
    protocols or procedures. It applysapplies generic messages to transport the information
    needed to establish the desired QoS for traffic flows in either one or both directions.
    This document can be used as the guideline for a prospective solution to the QoS
    signaling problem.</p>"
