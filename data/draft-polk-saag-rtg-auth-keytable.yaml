abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the application of a database of long-lived
    cryptographic keys to establish session-specific cryptographic keys to support
    authentication services in routing protocols. Keys may be established between
    two peers for pair-wise communications, or between groups of peers for multicast
    traffic.</p>"
