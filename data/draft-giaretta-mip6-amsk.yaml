abstract:
- content: <p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defines an extensible framework
    for performing network access authentication. Most EAP authentication algorithms,
    also known as "methods", export keying material that can be used with lower layer
    ciphersuites. It can be useful to leverage this keying material to derive usage
    specific keys that can be used to authenticate users or protect information exchange
    by other applications or services.For this purpose [10] proposes to derive root
    keys for each usage application and, then, child keys to actual be used. This
    document defines how to generate a Usage Specific Root Key (USRK) and a series
    of Application Master Session Keys (AMSKs) specific to Mobile IPv6 service. These
    AMSKs can be used by Mobile Node and Home Agent to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 protocol
    operation. This document defines how to generate Application Master Session Keys
    (AMSKs) specific to Mobile IPv6. These AMSKs can be used by Mobile Node and Home
    Agent to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 protocol operation.</p>
