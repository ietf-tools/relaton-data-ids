- content: "<p>This memo presents two recommendations to the Internet community concerning
    measures to improve and preserve Internet performance. It presents a strong recommendation
    for testing, standardization, and widespread deployment of active queue management
    in routers, to improve the performance of today's Internet. It also urges a concerted
    effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment of router mechanisms
    to protect the Internet from flows that are not sufficiently responsive to congestion
    notification. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does
    not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
