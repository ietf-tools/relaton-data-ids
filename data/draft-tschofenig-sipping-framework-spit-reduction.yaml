abstract:
- content: "<p>Spam, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk, is
    likely to become a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks. A number of solutions
    have been proposed for dealing with Spam for Internet Telephony (SPIT) and unwanted
    communication, such as content filtering, black lists, white lists, consent-based
    communication, reputation systems, address obfuscation, limited use addresses,
    turing tests, computational puzzles, payments at risk, circles of trust, and many
    others. This document describes the big picture that illustrates how the different
    building blocks fit together and can be deployed incrementally.</p>"
