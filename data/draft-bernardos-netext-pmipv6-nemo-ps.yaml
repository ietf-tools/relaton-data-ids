abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6 enables
    mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without
    changing the IP address. Current PMIPv6 specification does only support the movement
    of hosts within the localized mobility domain. A mobile network (commonly referred
    to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from the network-based localized
    mobility support provided by PMIPv6 [I-D.ietf-netext-pd-pmip], but with some limitations.
    This I-D describes what can be done with current standardized protocols, and describes
    the problem statement of fully supporting network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6.</p>"
