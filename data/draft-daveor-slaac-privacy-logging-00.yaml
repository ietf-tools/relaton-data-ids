abstract:
- content: "<p>The need for individual right to privacy and the need for law enforcement
    to be able to effectively investigate crime are sometimes portrayed as being irreconcilably
    in direct conflict with each other. Both needs are legitimate and ignoring the
    challenges presented by areas of conflict will not make the problem go away. The
    document presents a conceptual model that allows for both sets of requirements
    to be met simultaneously. The reason for this publication is to show that, with
    some creative thinking, it is possible to identify win-win solutions that simultaneously
    achieve both privacy and law enforcement goals.</p>"
