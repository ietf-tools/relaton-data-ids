abstract:
- content: "<p>Many service providers are exploring distributed computing techniques
    to achieve better service response time and optimized energy consumption. by moving
    Such techniques rely upon the distribution of computing services and capabilities
    over many locations in the network such as its edge(e.g., 5G MEC (Multi-access
    Edge Computing) scenarios), the metro region, virtualized central office, and
    other locations. In such a distributed computing environment, providing services
    by soliciting computing resources hosted in various computing facilities (e.g.,
    edges) is being considered, e.g., for computationally intensive and delay sensitive
    services. Ideally, Services should be computationally balanced using service-specific
    metrics instead of simply dispatching the service requests in a static way or
    optimizing solely connectivity metrics. For example, systematically directing
    end user-originated service requests to the geographically closest edge or some
    small computing units may lead to an unbalanced usage of computing resources,
    which may then degrade both the user experience and the overall service performance.
    This draft provides an overview of scenarios and problems associated with realizing
    such scenarios, identifying several key areas which require more investigations
    in terms of architecture and protocol to achieve balanced computing and networking
    resource utilization among edges providing the services.</p>"
