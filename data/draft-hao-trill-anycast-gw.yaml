abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft mainly describes centralized anycast layer 3 gateway solution
    in TRILL campus. Comparing to traditional VRRP based active-standby layer 3 gateway
    solution, this solution can achieve better load balancing and scalability. Anycast
    nickname, anycast gateway IP and MAC are introduced. It can ensure inter-subnet
    traffic forwarding in flow-based load balancing mode among all physical layer
    3 gateways. To avoid sending duplicated ARP reply message to the end system, ARP
    master gateway election mechanism is introduced. The election algorithm is described
    in this draft.</p>"
