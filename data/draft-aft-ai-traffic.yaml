abstract:
- content: "<p>The growth in terms of number of parameters of LLM models as well as
    the need to use or train those models with private or protected data will require
    service providers operating LLM-based services to cooperate to train, specialize
    or serve LLM-based services accross datacenters. Given their structure, the number
    of parameters they incorporate and the collective communication librairies they
    are built with, LLM training and inference (or serving) network traffic has specific
    characteristics. In that regard, understanding the specificities of AI-related
    workloads is critical to determine how to operate AI-based services in a federated
    setting across datacenters.</p>"
