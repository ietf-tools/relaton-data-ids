abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) based mechanism
    for transmission of user data packets, to be used with the Host Identity Protocol
    (HIP). IESG Note The following issues describe IESG concerns about this document.
    The IESG expects that these issues will be addressed when future versions of HIP
    are designed. In case of complex Security Policy Databases (SPDs) and the co-
    existence of HIP and security-related protocols such as IKE, implementors may
    encounter conditions that are unspecified in these documents. For example, when
    the SPD defines an IP address subnet to be protected and a HIP host is residing
    in that IP address area, there is a possibility that the communication is encrypted
    multiple times. Readers are advised to pay special attention when running HIP
    with complex SPD settings. Future specifications should clearly define when multiple
    encryption is intended, and when it should be avoided.</p>"
