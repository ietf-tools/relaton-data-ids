abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines RTP payload formats for the Video-based Dynamic
    Mesh Coding (V-DMC), which comprises several types of components, such as a base
    mesh, a set of displacements, 2D representations of attributes, and an atlas.
    New RTP payload formats are described for the base mesh and displacement components.
    The RTP payload header formats enable the packetization of a video stream packet
    within an RTP packet payload, as well as the fragmentation of a video stream packet
    into multiple RTP packets.</p>"
