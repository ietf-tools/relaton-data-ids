abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a digital-signature system based on cryptographic
    hash functions, following the seminal work in this area of Lamport, Diffie, Winternitz,
    and Merkle, as adapted by Leighton and Micali in 1995. It specifies a one-time
    signature scheme and a general signature scheme. These systems provide asymmetric
    authentication without using large integer mathematics and can achieve a high
    security level. They are suitable for compact implementations, are relatively
    simple to implement, and are naturally resistant to side-channel attacks. Unlike
    many other signature systems, hash-based signatures would still be secure even
    if it proves feasible for an attacker to build a quantum computer. This document
    is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF. This has been
    reviewed by many researchers, both in the research group and outside of it. The
    Acknowledgements section lists many of them.</p>"
