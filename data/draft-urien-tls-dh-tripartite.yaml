abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of privacy exchanges over the Internet rely on the TLS protocol.
    According to this protocol two entities the client and the server computes a master
    secret from which are deduced cryptographic keys used for data privacy and security.
    Digital transactions may deal with critical information (payments...) that need
    to be recorded for traceability issues or for legal requirements. However messages
    are secured by the TLS protocol, so it is not possible for a third party that
    logs packets to perform decryption operations upon legitimate requests. The goal
    of this draft is to support a Trusted Third Party (TTP) that could recover the
    protected information when needed. The proposed protocol uses the Tripartite Diffie-Hellman
    (tdh) algorithm based on bilinear pairings over elliptic curves.</p>"
