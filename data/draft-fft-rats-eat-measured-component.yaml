abstract:
- content: <p>A measured component is a measurable object of an attester's target
    environment, that is, an object whose state can be sampled and digested. Examples
    of measured components include the invariant part of firmware that is loaded in
    memory at startup time, a run-time integrity check, a file system object, or a
    CPU register. This document defines a "measured component" format that can be
    used with the EAT Measurements claim.</p>
