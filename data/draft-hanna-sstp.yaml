abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Scheduling Transfer Protocol (SSTP) provides a mechanism
    for the exchange of scheduling information between independent scheduling systems.
    This will allow users to schedule meetings with anyone, no matter what scheduling
    system they use. It also allows user agents to access scheduling data that is
    stored in scheduling systems. This opens up scheduling data for much more sophisticated
    access, such as automated scheduling programs and network computers.</p>"
