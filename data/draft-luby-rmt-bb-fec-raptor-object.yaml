abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Raptor code and its application to reliable
    delivery of objects. Two Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes
    are introduced, one for a non-systematic version of Raptor and one for a systematic
    version of Raptor, that supplements the FEC schemes described in RFC 3452. Raptor
    is a fountain code, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated
    by the encoder on-the-fly from the source symbols of a source block. The decoder
    is able to recover the source block from any set of encoding symbols only slightly
    more in number than the number of source symbols.</p>"
