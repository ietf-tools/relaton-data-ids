abstract:
- content: "<p>The stateless as well as stateful address autoconfiguration Protocols,
    as specified by the IETF, supports links with different properties. However, often
    these protocols assume specific properties and behavior from the underlying link
    type, as for example link-layer multicasting. The solution designer and implementers
    consider these specific link behavior while designing or extending these protocols.
    IETF Autoconf WG goal is to standardize mechanism for address autoconfiguration
    of nodes in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). Before designing such protocol, the
    link model for MANET as seen by the IP needs to be clearly understood. However,
    there is no document describing IP link model for MANET. This document is an attempt
    to bridge this gap.</p>"
