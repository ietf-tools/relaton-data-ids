abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP version 1 has been designed for optimum support multicast. However,
    in reality multicast is being used much less frequently than anticipated. Still,
    even for unicast (one sender, one receiver) full-fledged multicast-enabled RSVP
    signaling must be used. As pointed out in the NSIS requirement draft, multicast
    would not be necessarily required for an NSIS signaling protocol. This draft analyses
    ingredients of RSVP Version 1 which are affected by multicast, and derives how
    these ingredients may look like if multicast is not supported in the generic RSVP
    signaling protocol and adapt related functionalities accordingly - we call the
    resulting feature set 'RSVP Lite', a potentially more light-weight version of
    RSVP.</p>"
