abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliabilty is one of the essential requirements in data transmission
    network. In the traditional IP/TCP network, TCP provides end to end reliable transmission.
    Due to the high burst loss probability in Optical Burst Switching (OBS) Network,
    if we leave the retransmission work to the uppper IP/TCP layer, the network may
    be overloaded. Besides the simple retransmission in the IP/TCP network, OBS network
    which builds on Wavelength Division Mutiplexing system has a new retransmission
    scheme -- alternate wavelength retransmission. With the information of network
    status collected in the edge nodes, retransmission in the OBS network is more
    efficient and delay is shorter. Also TCP and OBS retransmission can work together
    which is called multi-layer retransmission.</p>"
