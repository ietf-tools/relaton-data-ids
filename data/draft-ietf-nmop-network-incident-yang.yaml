abstract:
- content: "<p>A network incident refers to an unexpected interruption of a network
    service, degradation of a network service quality, or sub-health of a network
    service. Different data sources including alarms, metrics, and other anomaly information
    can be aggregated into a few amount of network incidents by data correlation analysis
    and the service impact analysis. This document defines a YANG Module for the network
    incident lifecycle management. This YANG module is meant to provide a standard
    way to report, diagnose, and help resolve network incidents for the sake of network
    service health and root cause analysis.</p>"
