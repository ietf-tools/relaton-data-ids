abstract:
- content: <p>A common problem for sensitive web services is informing the client,
    in a reliable fashion, when a password protected resource is no longer valid because
    the user is logged out of the service. This is, in particular, considered a potential
    security problem by some sensitive services, such as online banking, when the
    user navigates the client's history list, which is supposed to display the resource
    as it was when it was loaded, not as it is the time the user navigates to it.
    This document presents a method for collecting such sensitive resources into a
    group, called a "Cache Context", which permits the server to invalidate all the
    resources belonging in the group either by direct action, or according to some
    expiration policy. The context can be configured to invalidate not just the resources,
    but also specific cookies, HTTP authentication credentials and HTTP over TLS session
    information.</p>
