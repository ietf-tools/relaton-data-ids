abstract:
- content: "<p>In mobile networks, the Mobile Router (MR) is an operational main entity.
    With multiple MRs, mobile networks can provide the stability of service. And,
    there already exist various multi-homing scenarios. However, because of mobility
    and MR-HA relations, there are several security problems in multi-homed mobile
    networks. In this draft, we identify threats to multi-homed mobile networks. And
    we will illustrate several scenarios of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, Redirection
    attacks, and Replay attacks.</p>"
