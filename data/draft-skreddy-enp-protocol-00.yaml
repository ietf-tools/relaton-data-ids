abstract:
- content: "<p>As the complexity of distributed applications increases, an increasing
    amount of processing is done using distributed processes, which typically execute
    without the direct supervision of an end user. The user must poll these processes
    periodically to check if they are completed successfully or not. This polling
    results in unnecessary wastage of network bandwidth as well as computing resources.
    The user generally cannot see intermediate results or progress reports for long
    running processes, they must wait till the process is completely finished before
    viewing the results. Thus the problem of monitoring events is central in distributed
    applications and protocols. A repeated need in such applications is receive notifications
    when a resource property value changes or event state changes. Current database
    systems provides mechanisms like constraints, triggers and active database rules.
    These facilities provides an automated means to ensure the database integrity
    or perform specific action when data changes. Need for such kind of requirement
    is fundamental is network applications</p>"
