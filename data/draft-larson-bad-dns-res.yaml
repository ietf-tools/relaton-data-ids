abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft describes DNS name server and stub resolver behavior
    that results in a significant query volume sent to the root and top-level domain
    (TLD) name servers. In some cases we recommend minor additions to the DNS protocol
    specification and corresponding changes in name server implementations to alleviate
    these unnecessary queries. In one case, we have highlighted behavior of a popular
    name server implementation that does not conform to the DNS specification. The
    recommendations made in this document are a direct byproduct of observation and
    analysis of abnormal query traffic patterns seen at two of the thirteen root name
    servers and all thirteen com/net/org TLD name servers.</p>"
