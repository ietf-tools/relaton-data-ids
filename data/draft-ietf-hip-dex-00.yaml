abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange (HIP
    DEX), a variant of the Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2). The HIP DEX protocol
    design aims at reducing the overhead of the employed cryptographic primitives
    by omitting public-key signatures and hash functions. In doing so, the main goal
    is to still deliver similar security properties to HIPv2. The HIP DEX protocol
    is primarily designed for computation or memory- constrained sensor/actuator devices.
    Like HIPv2, it is expected to be used together with a suitable security protocol
    such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) for the protection of upper layer
    protocol data. In addition, HIP DEX can also be used as a keying mechanism for
    security primitives at the MAC layer, e.g., for IEEE 802.15.4 networks.</p>"
