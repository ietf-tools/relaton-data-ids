abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently there are a number of efforts trying to connect the packet-
    switching network with circuit-switching network, especially the Internet with
    public telephone networks. The first problem of such interconnection is naming
    and addressing, which are described in some other drafts ([dnsurl], [telurl1],
    [faxemail]). This draft gives a brief framework on what the problems we may have
    in architecture and technology when connecting these two networks, and the possible
    solutions for these problems.</p>"
