abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier
    0, Single-Window Congestion Control, in the Datagram Control Protocol (DCP) [DCP].
    DCP implements a congestion-controlled, unreliable flow of datagrams suitable
    for use by applications such as streaming media. The Single- Window Congestion
    Control CCID is used by senders that promise to send no data whatsoever, except
    possibly for a single initial window of data sent at the beginning of the connection.</p>"
