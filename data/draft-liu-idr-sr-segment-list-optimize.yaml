abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an optimization method for segment list arrangement
    the SR Policy TLV of the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute. This optimization
    solves the problem of the Segment Routing's penultimate segment node being unable
    to perform the penultimate Segment Pop (PSP) behavior when the egress node has
    both End SID and service SID encapsulated in Segment Routing Header's segment
    List. This solution adds an E-Flag to the SRv6 SID Endpoint Behavior sub-TLV carried
    in Segment List Sub-TLV of the SR Policy TLV. This optimization can improve the
    forwarding efficiency of data packets when End SID and Service SID are present.</p>"
