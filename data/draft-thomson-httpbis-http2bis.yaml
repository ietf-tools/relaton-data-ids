abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics
    of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2).
    HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception
    of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent
    exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations
    from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not
    obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.</p>"
