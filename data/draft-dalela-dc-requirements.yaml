abstract:
- content: "<p>The problems of modern datacenters are rooted in virtualized host scaling.
    Virtualization implies VM mobility, which may be intra- datacenter or inter-datacenter.
    Mobility may cross administrative boundaries, such as across private-public domains.
    A public datacenter may be multi-tenant, extending several private networks into
    the public domain. Running these massively scaled, virtualized, multi-tenant datacenters
    poses some unique networking and operational challenges. This document describes
    these challenges.</p>"
