abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo offers non-normative implementation guidance for the RTP
    MIDI payload format. The memo presents its advice in the context of a network
    musical performance application. In this application two musicians, located in
    different physical locations, interact over a network to perform as they would
    if located in the same room. Underlying the performances are RTP MIDI sessions
    over unicast UDP. Algorithms for sending and receiving recovery journals (the
    resiliency structure for the payload format) are described in detail.</p>"
