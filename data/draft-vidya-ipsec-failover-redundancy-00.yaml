abstract:
- content: "<p>Recovering from failure of IPsec gateways or servers maintaining large
    numbers of SAs may take several minutes, if they need to re- establish the IPsec
    SAs by re-running the key management protocol, IKEv2. This draft proposes IPsec
    and IKEv2 SA storage and retrieval mechanisms to improve the recovery time after
    an IPsec gateway or server failure.</p>"
