abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the years there have been various proposals as to use namespaces
    other than the DNS/IN namespace that is under ICANN administration. Some of these
    were simple DNS competitors others use different lookup technologies. In addition
    it is hard to supply different character encodings to DNS as each application
    needs to provide the translation between the encoding used and the format expected
    by DNS. This draft proposes a new service layer to provide multiplexing of different
    namespaces into appropriate function calls.</p>"
