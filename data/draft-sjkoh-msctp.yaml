abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how to use of SCTP for IP handover support.
    With the help of the dynamic address reconfiguration, the SCTP with the ADDIP
    extension (called mSCTP) would provide soft handover for the mobile terminals
    without any additional support of routers/agents in the networks. For location
    management, the mSCTP could be used along with Mobile IP, Session Initiation Protocol
    or Reliable Server Pooling. We also discuss the use of mSCTP along with Mobile
    IP for Internet mobility support.</p>"
