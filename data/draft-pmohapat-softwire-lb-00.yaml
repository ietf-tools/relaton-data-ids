abstract:
- content: "<p>Payloads carried over a Softwire mesh service as defined by BGP Encapsulation
    Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) information exchange often carry a
    number of identifiable, distinct flows. It can in some circumstances be desirable
    to distribute these flows over the equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist
    in the packet switched network. Currently, the payload of a packet entering the
    Softwire can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers. Thus the load
    balancing decision of a core router is only based on the encapsulating header,
    presenting much less entropy than available in the payload or the encapsulated
    header since the Softwire encapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion. This document
    describes a method for achieving comparable load balancing efficiency in a network
    carrying Softwire mesh service over Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)
    over IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what would be
    achieved without such encapsulation.</p>"
