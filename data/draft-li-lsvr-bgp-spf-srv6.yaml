abstract:
- content: "<p>For network scenarios such as Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs),
    BGP is extended for Link-State (LS) distribution and the Shortest Path First (SPF)
    algorithm based calculation. BGP-LS-SPF leverages the mechanisms of both BGP protocol
    and BGP-LS protocol extensions. Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) provides a source
    routing mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological
    path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SRv6
    domain. In some networks, it may be useful to enable SRv6 based source routing
    mechanism together with BGP-LS-SPF. This document proposes to introduce the BGP
    Link-State (BGP-LS) extensions for SRv6 to the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI.</p>"
