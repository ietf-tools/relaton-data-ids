abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of fog computing has emerged driven by the Internet of
    Things (IoT) due to the need of handling the data generated from the end-user
    devices. The term fog is referred to any networked computational resource in the
    continuum between things and cloud. In fog computing, functions can be stiched
    together composing a service function chain. These functions might be hosted on
    resources that are inherently heterogeneous, volatile and mobile. This means that
    resources might appear and disappear, and the connectivity characteristics between
    these resources may also change dynamically. This calls for new orchestration
    solutions able to cope with dynamic changes to the resources in runtime or ahead
    of time (in anticipation through prediction) as opposed to todayâ€™s solutions which
    are inherently reactive and static or semi-static. A fog monitoring solution can
    be used to help predicting events so an action can be taken before an event actually
    takes place. This solution is composed of agents running on the fog nodes plus
    a controller hosted at another device (running in the infrastructure or in another
    fog node). Since fog environments are inherently volatile and extremely dynamic,
    it is convenient to enable the use of autonomic technologies to autonomously set-up
    the fog monitoring platform. This document aims at presenting this use case as
    well as specifying how to use GRASP as needed in this scenario.</p>"
