abstract:
- content: "<p>This document argues in favor of Internet service providers deploying
    technologies which offer increased privacy to users of their services. The discussion
    is independent of any particular privacy technology. The approach is to consider
    common objections to the the deployment of such technologies, and show that these
    objections are not well-founded.</p>"
