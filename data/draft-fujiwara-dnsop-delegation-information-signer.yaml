abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC does not protect delegation information, it contains NS RRSet
    on the parent side and glue records. This document defines delegation information
    signer (DiS) resource record for protecting the delegation information, by inserting
    on the parent side of zone cut to hold a hash of delegation information. The DiS
    resource record reuses the type code and wire format of DS resource record, and
    distinguishes it from existing DS RRSet by using a new digest type. This document
    also describes the usage of DiS resource record and shows the implications on
    security-aware resolvers. The definition and usage are compatible with current
    DNSSEC.</p>"
