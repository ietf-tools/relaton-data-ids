abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to reduce redundant packet transmissions
    for the IS-IS Routing protocol, as described in ISO 10589 [1]. The described mechanism
    can be used to reduce the flooding of Link State PDUs (LSPs) in IS-IS topologies.
    The net effect is to engineer a flooding topology for LSPs which is a subset of
    the physical topology. This draft serves to document the existing behavior in
    deployed implementations. The draft describes changes to implementations, not
    to the protocol. These changes are backwards compatible with implementations that
    do not support this feature.</p>"
