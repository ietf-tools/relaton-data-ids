abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines the common framework for applications
    to announce and discover services. This includes service names, service instance
    names, common parameters for selecting a service instance (weight, priority) as
    well as service specific parameters. GRASP is intended to also be used for service
    discovery. Reinventing service discovery for GRASP with a similar set of fetures
    would result in duplication of work. Therefore, this document defines how to use
    GRASP to announce and discover services in a way that inherits DNS-SD features
    and also tries to be compatible in spirit as much as possibel while still maintaining
    the intended simplicity of GRASP. The goal of this document is to permit defining
    service and their parameters once and then use that in GRASP, mDNS and (unicast)
    DNS. Future work can also define DNS-SD &lt;-&gt; GRASP gateway functions. In
    support of service discovery, this document also defines name discovery and schemes
    for reuseable elements in GRASP objectives which are designed to be extensible
    so that future work that identifies elements required across multiple objectives
    do not need to define a scheme how to do this.</p>"
