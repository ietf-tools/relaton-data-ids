abstract:
- content: "<p>There are deployments where the Layer-3 interface on which IGP operates
    is a Layer-2 interface bundle. Existing IGP advertisements only support advertising
    link attributes of the Layer-3 interface. If entities external to IGP wish to
    control traffic flows on the individual physical links that comprise the Layer-2
    interface bundle, link attribute information about the bundle members is advertised
    by IGP extensions for Layer-2 (L2) bundle. When Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6)
    is used with Layer-2 interface bundle to control traffic flows on the individual
    member links, the SRv6 SIDs which represent the Layer 2 member links of the L2
    bundle needs to be advertised in IGP. This document proposes the IGP extensions
    to advertise the SRv6 SIDs of the Layer 2 (L2) bundle member links.</p>"
