abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, each network is often secured by a unique device (i.e. security
    gateway or firewall) that becomes a bottleneck for the end-to-end security model
    with IPv6. The deployment of IPv6 enabled devices and networks bring some issues,
    which must be addressed by security administrators in order to guarantee at least
    the same level of security that is obtained nowadays with IPv4 and network-based
    (including perimetral-based) security schemes, allowing at the same time all the
    IPv6 advantages.</p>"
