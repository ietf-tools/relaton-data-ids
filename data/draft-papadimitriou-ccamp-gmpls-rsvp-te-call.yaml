abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networking topologies it may be advantageous to maintain
    associations between endpoints and key transit points to support an instance of
    a service. Such associations are known as Calls. A Call does not provide the actual
    connectivity for transmitting user traffic, but only builds a relationship by
    which subsequent connections may be made. In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such connections
    are known as Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This document specifies how GMPLS RSVP-TE
    signaling may be used and extended to support Calls. These mechanisms provide
    full and logical Call/Connection separation. The mechanisms proposed in this document
    are applicable to any environment (including multi-area), and for any type of
    interface: packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed, lambda or fiber switching.</p>"
