abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to the MIME
    specifications [RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048, RFC 2049] can convey presentational
    information. It specifies the 'Content- Disposition' header field, which is optional
    and valid for any MIME entity ('message' or 'body part'). Two values for this
    header field are described in this memo; one for the ordinary linear presentation
    of the body part, and another to facilitate the use of mail to transfer files.
    Another content-disposition value, for use in HTML file uploads, has been defined
    in a separate document. [RFC 2388]. It is expected that additional values will
    be defined in the future, and this memo defines the procedures for extending the
    set of values. This document is intended as an extension to MIME, which itself
    is an extension to [RFC 822]. As such, the reader is assumed to be familiar with
    both the MIME specifications and RFC 822. The information presented herein supplements
    but does not replace that found in those documents. This document is a revision
    to the Proposed Standard protocol defined in RFC 2183. As compared to RFC 2183,
    this document contains minor editorial updates, which are summarized in section
    10 of this document.</p>"
