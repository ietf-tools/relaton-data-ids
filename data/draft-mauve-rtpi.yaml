abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies RTP/I, an application level real-time protocol
    for distributed interactive media. Typical examples of distributed interactive
    media are shared whiteboards, networked computer games and distributed virtual
    environments. RTP/I defines a standardized framing for the transmission of data
    and provides mechanisms that are universally needed for this media class. Thereby
    RTP/I enables the development of reusable functionality and generic services that
    can be employed for multiple distributed interactive media. Examples for this
    kind of functionality are the ability to record sessions, to support late coming
    participants, and to provide security services. RTP/I is a protocol that follows
    the ideas of application level framing and integrated layer processing. It has
    been designed to be independent of the underlying network and transport layers.
    To a large extend RTP/I has been inspired by the real-time transport protocol
    (RTP), which is used for continuous non-interactive media. This document is intended
    to stimulate the discussion on how to transport distributed interactive media
    over the Internet. There exists an RTP/I mailing list. Instructions on how to
    subscribe to this list can be found at the RTP/I homepage (http://www.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/informatik/pi4/projects/
    RTPI/index.html). Feedback on this document should be addressed to the RTP/I mailing
    list or directly to the authors.</p>"
