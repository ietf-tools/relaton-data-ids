abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many protocols designed and deployed on the Internet today
    which do not naturally traverse Network Address Translators (NAT). In order to
    allow these protocols to work in the presence of NAT, additional logic needs to
    be added to the network. This logic modifies the behavior of the protocol in some
    way. There are choices where this logic can be placed in the network. It can reside
    in the NATs themselves, transparently altering the protocol; when this occurs,
    it is called an Application Layer Gateway (ALG). It can reside in server components,
    hiding the changes from NATs and clients alike, it can reside in the clients,
    or it can reside in a combination thereof. The choice of the placement of this
    logic typically has implications on many aspects of the protocol, including security,
    deployability, manageability and availability. This document provides a set of
    considerations that should be taken into account by protocol and network designers
    when making this choice.</p>"
