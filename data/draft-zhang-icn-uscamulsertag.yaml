abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on the important concepts and research challenges described in
    RFC 7927, we consider multi-service tagging technology to be an effective name
    mechanism for audio and video content in ICN. Since audio and video traffic is
    the primary traffic transmitted over the Internet, it will greatly advance the
    current Internet architecture to the ICN architecture, the name mechanism for
    creating audio and video content. This article discusses typical cases of improvements
    using name mechanisms, including content resource exchange between different ISPs,
    resource caching of content naming information, and data distribution for different
    transmission quality requirements in low latency environments.</p>"
