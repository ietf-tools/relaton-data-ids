abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in the state of resources
    and obtain a current representation of the last resource state. This document
    defines two new options for CoAP Observe so that a CoAP client can specify timing
    conditions when observing a resource on a CoAP server. As a result, the CoAP client
    is only informed about resource state changes when the timing conditions are met.
    This offers possibilities to extend network intelligence, enhance scalability,
    and optimize the lifetime and performance in order to address the requirements
    from the Constrained Nodes and Networks.</p>"
