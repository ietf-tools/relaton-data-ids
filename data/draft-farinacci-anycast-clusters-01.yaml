abstract:
- content: "<p>Anycast Clusters is a proposal to connect multiple ISP sparse-mode
    PIM domains together. The environment we anticipate is multiple interconnection
    points among a set of ISPs when they are unable to colocate their respective RPs
    at the same dense-mode interconnect point. This is an alternative to the Multi-Level
    RP design and requires less new code in routers. This proposal is being submitted
    as a method for the initial phase of Inter-Domain Multicast deployment and is
    upward compatible with the IDMR protocols being proposed for subsequent phases.</p>"
