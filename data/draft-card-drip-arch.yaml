abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an architecture for Drone Remote Identification
    Protocol (DRIP) Working Group protocols and services to support Unmanned Aircraft
    System Remote Identification (UAS RID) and RID- related communications, including
    its building blocks and their interfaces, all to be standardized. CAVEAT LECTOR:
    This draft version is undergoing substantial restructuring and is submitted to
    the DRIP WG only to spark discussion on architecture and to be adopted as a placeholder
    if there is consensus that there should be an architecture document (however far
    from any future consensus on that architecture this draft may be).</p>"
