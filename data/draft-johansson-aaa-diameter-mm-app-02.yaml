abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Diameter application that allows a Diameter
    server to authenticate, authorize, and collect accounting information for Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) services rendered to a client node. This application,
    combined with the base Diameter protocol and appropriate SIP extensions, allows
    SIP User Agents (UAs) to obtain services from SIP servers that are connected to
    a Diameter infrastructure. When combined with the Inter-Domain capability of the
    base protocol, service may even be obtained from SIP servers that belong to foreign
    domains, as would be encountered by roaming mobile nodes. Note that the specification
    defined here may be used independently of the authentication technique used for
    authenticating a node's link layer or network-layer access. In particular, we
    do not require that the client node was authenticated for access with the use
    of either the Mobile IP [4] or NASREQ [3] Diameter application.</p>"
