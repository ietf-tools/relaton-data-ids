abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism to associate a WebDAV ([WEBDAV])
    property with an entry in a Semantics Register. A Semantics Register documents
    the meaning of properties in a formal manner and may be implemented with schema
    technologies such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema ([XMLSCHEMA]) or
    Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schema ([RDFS]). Schema technologies expose
    the derivation of complex properties from simpler concepts, as demonstrated in
    the Basic Semantics Register ([BSR]) for data elements used in Electronic Data
    Interchange. Registering the meanings of properties in this manner can enhance
    interoperability across systems and throughout the long-term information life
    cycle.</p>"
