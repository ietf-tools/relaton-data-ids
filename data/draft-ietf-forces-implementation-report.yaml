abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural
    framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between
    the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES network element (ForCES
    NE). RFC 3654 has defined the ForCES requirements, and RFC 3746 has defined the
    ForCES framework. This document is an implementation report for the ForCES Protocol,
    Model, and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol-based Transport Mapping Layer
    (SCTP TML) documents, and includes a report on interoperability testing and the
    current state of ForCES implementations. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
