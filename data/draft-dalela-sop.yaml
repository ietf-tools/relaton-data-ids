abstract:
- content: "<p>Cloud services need to interoperate across cloud providers, service
    vendors and private/public domains. To enable this interoperability, there is
    need for a standard wire-format for exchanging service information. This document
    describes a Service Orchestration Protocol (SOP) to be used as a standard wire-format
    for cloud exchanges. Similar to widely used protocols like HTTP, SIP and SMTP,
    SOP uses text-based messages, which are easily extensible and may be inspected
    at cloud proxies. While SOP carries service-independent information, service-dependant
    information is attached as a Service Description Framework [SDF] payload to SOP
    packets. This is similar to how HTML is transported over HTTP. SDF is a XML schema
    for describing services. SOP and SDF enable any kind of service to be discovered
    and orchestrated across private and public domains. Simple protocol compliance
    tests can be employed to ensure interoperability across domains. SOP wire-formats
    can be used with existing cloud APIs. Using these, it would be possible to interoperate
    diverse APIs and cloud services across service providers, service vendors and
    service users.</p>"
