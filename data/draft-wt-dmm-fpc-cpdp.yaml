abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification as per this document supports the separation of the
    Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the actual Data-Plane.
    The protocol semantics abstract from the actual details for the configuration
    of Data-Plane nodes and apply between a Client function, which is used by an application
    of the mobility Control- Plane, and an Agent function, which is associated with
    the configuration of Data-Plane nodes according to the policies issued by the
    mobility Control-Plane. The scope of the policies comprises forwarding rules and
    treatment of packets in terms of encapsulation, IP address re-writing and QoS.
    Additional protocol semantics are described to support the maintenance of the
    Data-Plane path.</p>"
