abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP/3 was initially specified only for use with the QUIC version 1
    transport protocol. This specification defines how to use HTTP/3 over a WebTransport
    session, which can be implemented using any WebTransport protocol. This enables
    operation of HTTP/3 when UDP based transport is not available, as well as server-initiated
    HTTP/3 requests.</p>"
