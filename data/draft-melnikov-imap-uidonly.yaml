abstract:
- content: "<p>The UIDONLY extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC
    3501/RFC 9051) allows clients to request that all information about mailbox changes
    is returned only using UIDs. Message numbers are not going to be returned and
    can't be used once this extension is enabled. This helps both clients and servers
    to reduce resource usage required for maintenance of message number to UID map.</p>"
