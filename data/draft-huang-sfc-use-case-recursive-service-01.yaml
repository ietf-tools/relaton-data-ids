abstract:
- content: "<p>Service function chaining (SFC) provides various services that can
    be tailored to different requirements from diversified user groups, where each
    user group forms a collective client that requires similar service. SFC is typically
    deployed as a service overlay with its own service topology on top of existing
    network topology. This kind of virtualized structure naturally enables recursive
    service relationship where a client may become a service provider and resell SFC
    services to its own user groups. Alternatively, a client may also choose to ask
    its service provider to provide a structured service for its user groups. This
    document describes some exemplary use cases that show the usage of recursive (e.g.
    nested) or structured service function chaining relationship.</p>"
