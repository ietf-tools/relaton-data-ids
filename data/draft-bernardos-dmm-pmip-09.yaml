abstract:
- content: "<p>The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected to
    be ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a limitation
    for deploying current mobility management schemes that are intrinsically centralized,
    e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6. For this reason it has been waved a need
    for distributed and dynamic mobility management approaches, with the objective
    of reducing operators' burdens, evolving to a cheaper and more efficient architecture.
    This draft describes multiple solutions for network-based distributed mobility
    management inspired by the well known Proxy Mobile IPv6.</p>"
