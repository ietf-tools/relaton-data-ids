- content: "<p>QUIC is a new transport protocol that provides low-latency communication
    and security. QUIC's key features include faster connection establishment, stream-based
    multiplexing, improved loss recovery, and no head-of-line blocking. This document
    assesses the potential human rights implications emerging from the deployment
    of QUIC. The assessment is done based on the methodology articulated in [RFC8280].</p>"
