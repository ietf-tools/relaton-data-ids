abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a critique of Internet e-mail addressing, with particular
    reference to its suitability for use in a general purpose interpersonal communication
    medium as opposed to its present use largely within a restricted community. The
    critique focusses on the differences between e-mail addresses and other forms
    of addressing with which very many lay people are intimately familiar. This memo
    does not offer any solutions to the issues raised; rather it is hoped to provoke
    some debate on the matter. The author would be particularly interested in views
    from those whose natural language does not use the Roman (western) alphabet.</p>"
