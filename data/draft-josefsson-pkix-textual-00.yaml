abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describe and discuss the text encodings of Public-Key
    Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates, PKIX Certificate Revocation Lists
    (CRLs), PKCS #10 Certificate Request Syntax, PKCS #7 structures, and Attribute
    Certificates. The text encodings are well- known, implemented by several applications
    and libraries, and is widely deployed. This document is intended to articulate
    the de- facto rules that existing implementations operate by, and to give recommendations
    that will promote interoperability going forward.</p>"
