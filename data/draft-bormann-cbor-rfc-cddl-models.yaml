abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of CBOR- and JSON-based protocols have been defined before
    CDDL was standardized or widely used. This short draft records some CDDL definitions
    for such protocols, which could become part of a library of CDDL definitions available
    for use in CDDL2 processors. It focuses on CDDL in (almost) published IETF RFCs.</p>"
