- content: "<p>The DNS has long relied upon serial number arithmetic, a concept which
    has never really been defined, certainly not in an IETF document, though which
    has been widely understood. This memo supplies the missing definition. It is intended
    to update RFC1034 and RFC1035. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
