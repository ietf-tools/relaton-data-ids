abstract:
- content: "<p>The CAPWAP problem statement describes a problem that needs to be addressed
    before a wireless LAN (WLAN) network designer can construct a solution composed
    of Wireless Termination Points (WTP) and Access Controllers (AC) from multiple,
    different vendors. One of the primary goals is to find a solution that solves
    the interoperability between the two classes of devices (WTPs and ACs) which then
    enables an AC from one vendor to control and manage a WTP from another. RNP is
    a protocol that supports the management of WTP's Radio information, Session Parameters,
    Data Forwarding and interaction with the Wireless Portal. The RNP protocol consists
    of five sub- protocols: RNP-DT (Data Tunneling), RNP-SM (Session Management),
    RNP-RC (Radio Control), RNP-DF (Data Forwarding), and RNP-WP (Wireless Portal).
    The RTP protocol with it's family of protocol provides a complete control situation
    for the CAPWAP environment. In many ways, RNP provides a super set of the RNP
    requiremetns.</p>"
