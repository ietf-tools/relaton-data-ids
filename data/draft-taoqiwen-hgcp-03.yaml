abstract:
- content: "<p>In an era where AI-generated content has become indistinguishable from
    human writing, the Human-Generated Content Protocol (HGCP) proposes a voluntary
    signing framework that enables human authors to publicly acknowledge their expressions.
    Rather than detecting or classifying content origin, HGCP allows individuals to
    declare, in a structured and verifiable format, that they take responsibility
    for a specific piece of content. The protocol is platform-neutral, identity-flexible,
    and suitable for both real-name and pseudonymous use. It does not evaluate accuracy,
    originality, or quality; it simply enables people to say: “This is mine, and I
    stand by it.” By providing a lightweight, human-first declaration format, HGCP
    aims to preserve the visibility of human agency within an increasingly synthetic
    information ecosystem.</p>"
