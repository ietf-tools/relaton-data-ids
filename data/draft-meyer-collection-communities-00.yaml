abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP communities (RFC 1997) are used by service providers for many purposes,
    including tagging of customer, peer, and geographically originated routes. Such
    tagging is typically used to control the scope of redistribution of routes within
    a provider's network, and to its peers and customers. With the advent of large
    scale BGP data collection (and associated research), it has become clear that
    the information carried in such communities is essential for a deeper understanding
    of the global routing system. This document defines standard (outbound) communities
    and their encodings for export to BGP route collectors.</p>"
