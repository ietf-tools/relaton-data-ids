abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies a need for and proposes improvement of the
    unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) techniques (see RFC 3704) for detection
    and mitigation of source address spoofing (see BCP 38). Strict uRPF is inflexible
    about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the current
    feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance between the two (see RFC 3704).
    However, as shown in this document, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has
    shortcomings. This document describes enhanced feasible-path uRPF (EFP-uRPF) techniques
    that are more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path
    uRPF (RFC 3704). The proposed EFP-uRPF methods aim to significantly reduce false
    positives regarding invalid detection in source address validation (SAV). Hence,
    they can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting
    service for their customers and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.
    This document updates RFC 3704.</p>"
