abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to loadshare the different paths of a
    multihomed SCTP association at the same moment while keeping congestion control
    per path. The document also describes a possible solution to multihoming which
    would require no routing tables on the host and which would try to guarantee non-overlapping
    multihomed paths. It could possibly reduce the growth of the routing table in
    a router. The selection of which link to take would be a local one. The solution
    is similar to the use of links and linksets within a routeset in SS7.</p>"
