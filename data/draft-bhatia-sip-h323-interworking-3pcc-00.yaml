    environment. Third party call control refers to the ability of one entity to create
    a call in which communications is actually between other parties [1]. The SIP-H.323
    Interworking function is discussed in [4]. Here we discuss how the Interworking
    entity can function as a controller for third party call control, as well as an
    party to it.</p>"
