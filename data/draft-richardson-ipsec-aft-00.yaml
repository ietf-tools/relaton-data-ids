abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of proposed protocols describe mechanisms whereby end to end
    authentication or privacy may be negotiated: most notable is the IPSEC working
    group where these issues are dealt with in a general way. Some relating working
    groups make use of the IPSEC (and related IPv6 facilities) facilities to provide
    authentication services (mobileip), while other groups (notably SNMPv2, RSVP,
    OSPF, BGP, AFT and CAT) provide their own facilities. This documents describes
    some of the common considerations for all of these protocols when there exists
    security gateway(s) (aka 'firewalls') between the end nodes that are negotiating
    security. This document does not enter into the debate about node security versus
    network security. It is assumed that the need for firewall like facilities will
    continue to exist for sometime. Whether or not IPSEC and/or IPv6 security services
    make firewalls obsolete or more common will remain a heated question for sometime.</p>"
