abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework and basis for the IANA registration
    of parameters defined in the ITU V.150 recommendation, which addresses the transmission
    of modem signals over IP. This includes both modem passthrough and modem relay
    operation. As a framework document, this internet draft leaves the details of
    the modem-over-IP (MoIP) protocols and formats to the ITU V.150 recommendation.
    Since the V.150 recommendation is work in progress by ITU SG16/Q11, registration
    of these parameters is contingent upon its impending ratification. Although these
    parameters are meant for use in text-based control protocols such as SDP, equivalent
    reformulations are planned for non-text protocols such as ITU H.245.</p>"
