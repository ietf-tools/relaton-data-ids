abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents the third version of a protocol for a peer-to-peer
    based chat system. In this version it is extended for supporting message exchange
    in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) that suffer from node mobility. Messages can
    be cryptographically signed, encrypted and anonymized allowing authentic and closed
    group communication as well as anonymous communication. This work is input for
    a practical course on software engineering at Technische Universitaet Braunschweig.
    It is experimental work that is not intended to go to the IETF standards track.</p>"
