abstract:
- content: "<p>RPL allows different mode of operations which allows nodes to have
    a consensus on the basic primitives that must be supported to join the network.
    The MOP field in RFC6550 is of 3 bits and is fast depleting. This document extends
    the MOP field specification and adds a notion of capabilities using which the
    nodes can further advertise their support for, possibly optional, capabilities.</p>"
