abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new CSR attribute, bindingRequest, and a new
    X.509 certificate extension, BoundCertificates. The use of the bindingRequest
    attribute in a CSR and the inclusion of the BoundCertificates extension in the
    resulting certificate together provide additional assurance that multiple certificates
    each belong to the same end entity. This mechanism is particularly useful in the
    context of non-composite hybrid authentication, which enables users to employ
    the same certificates in hybrid authentication as in authentication done with
    only traditional or PQ algorithms.</p>"
