abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols for email are based
    upon already existing email and encryption formats (such as PGP/MIME) and designed
    to allow for easily implementable and interoperable opportunistic encryption.
    The protocols range from key distribution, secret key synchronization between
    own devices, to mechanisms of metadata and content protection. The metadata and
    content protection is achieved by moving the whole message (not only the body
    part) into the PGP/MIME encrypted part. The proposed pEp Email Formats not only
    achieve simple forms of metadata protection (like subject encryption), but also
    allow for sending email messages through a mixnet. Such enhanced forms of metadata
    protection are explicitly discussed within the scope of this document. The purpose
    of pEp for email is to simplify and automate operations in order to make usage
    of email encryption viable for a wider range of Internet users, with the goal
    of achieving widespread implementation of data confidentiality and privacy practices
    in the real world. The proposed operations and formats are targeted towards Opportunistic
    Security scenarios and are already implemented in several applications of pretty
    Easy privacy (pEp).</p>"
