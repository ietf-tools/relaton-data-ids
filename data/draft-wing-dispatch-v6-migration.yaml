abstract:
- content: "<p>During the migration from IPv4 to IPv6, it is anticipated that an IPv6
    path might be broken for a variety of reasons, causing endpoints to not receive
    RTP data. Connectivity checks would detect and avoid the user noticing such a
    problem, but there is industry reluctance to implement connectivity checks. This
    document describes a mechanism allowing dual-stack SIP endpoints to attempt communications
    over IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 if the IPv6 path is not working. The mechanism
    does not require connectivity checks.</p>"
