abstract:
- content: <p>In dense topologies (such as data center fabrics based on the Clos and
    butterfly topologies, though not limited to those exclusively), IGP flooding mechanisms
    designed originally for sparse topologies can "overflood," or in other words generate
    too many identical copies of topology and reachability information arriving at
    a given node from other devices. This normally results in slower convergence times
    and higher resource utilization to process and discard the superfluous copies.
    The modifications to the flooding mechanism in the Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) link state protocol described in this document reduce resource
    utilization significantly, while increaseing convergence performance in dense
    topologies. Beside reducing the extraneous copies it uses the dense topologies
    to "load-balance" flooding across different possible paths in the network to prevent
    build up of flooding hot-spots. Note that a Clos fabric is used as the primary
    example of a dense flooding topology throughout this document. However, the flooding
    optimizations described in this document apply to any arbitrary topology.</p>
