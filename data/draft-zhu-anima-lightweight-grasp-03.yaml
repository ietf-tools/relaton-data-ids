abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the UDP-based Constrained GeneRic Autonomic
    Signaling Protocol (cGRASP), which is designed to be a constrained and lightweight
    version of the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol(GRASP, or the standard GRASP),
    with shortened messages and a built-in reliability mechanism. cGRASP can work
    reliably over UDP, making it suitable for IoT, where lightweight and resource-
    constrained devices dominate. Given the established ecosystem of CoAP and aiming
    to promote cGRASP adoption in IoT, this document also focuses on the cGRASP transition
    from UDP to a CoAP-based framework, i.e., CoAP-based cGRASP. Furthermore, this
    document also discusses the potential way to adapt the cGRASP to work on the network
    without IP connectivity.</p>"
