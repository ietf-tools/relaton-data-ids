abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft follows the invitation of [I-D.farrell-ufmrg-sample] to
    propose another sample problem for demonstration, training, and evaluation of
    formal methods in IETF work. It draws on recent work from the Software Updates
    for the Internet of Things [suit] and Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning
    [teep] working groups to define a sample modeling problem for a novel rather than
    a familiar IETF protocol.</p>"
