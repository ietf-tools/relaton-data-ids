abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) has long provided means, such as CNAME
    (Canonical Name), where a query can be redirected to a different name. A DNS response
    header has an RCODE (Response Code) field, used for indicating errors, and response
    status bits. This document clarifies, in the case of such redirected queries,
    how the RCODE and status bits correspond to the initial query cycle (where the
    CNAME or the like was detected) and subsequent or final query cycles.</p>"
