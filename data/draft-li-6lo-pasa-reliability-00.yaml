abstract:
- content: "<p>Path-Aware Semantic Address (PASA [I-D.li-6lo-path-aware-semantic-addressing]),
    proposes to algorithmically assign short addresses to nodes in a 6lo environment
    so to achieve stateless forwarding, hence, avoiding using a routing protocol.
    PASA is more suitable in case of stable and static wireline connectivity, in order
    to avoid renumbering due to topology changes. Even in such kind of scenarios,
    reliability remains an issue. This memo tackles specifically reliability in PASA
    deployments, analyzing possible broad solution categories to solve the issue.</p>"
