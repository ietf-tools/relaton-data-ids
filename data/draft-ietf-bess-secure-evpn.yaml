abstract:
- content: "<p>The applications of EVPN-based solutions (BGP MPLS-based Ethernet VPN
    and Network Virtualization Overlay Solution using EVPN) have become pervasive
    in Data Center, Service Provider, and Enterprise segments. It is being used for
    fabric overlays and inter-site connectivity in the Data Center market segment,
    for Layer-2, Layer-3, and IRB VPN services in the Service Provider market segment,
    and for fabric overlay and WAN connectivity in Enterprise networks. For Data Center
    and Enterprise applications, there is a need to provide inter-site and WAN connectivity
    over public Internet in a secured manner with same level of privacy, integrity,
    and authentication for tenant's traffic as IPsec tunneling using IKEv2. This document
    presents a solution where BGP point-to-multipoint signaling is leveraged for key
    and policy exchange among PE devices to create private pair-wise IPsec Security
    Associations without IKEv2 point-to-point signaling or any other direct peer-to-peer
    session establishment messages.</p>"
