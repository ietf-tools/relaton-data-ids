abstract:
- content: "<p>In Mobile IPv6 home link operation on point-to-point links requires
    that one prefix can only be assigned to one mobile node by the home agent (HA)
    and different mobile nodes can not share this home network prefix. Managing Per-MN
    home network prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the HA. Based
    on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we propose a new technique
    in which HA offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6
    server. HA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile station to the DHCPv6 server.
    Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create a home address. When the mobile
    node leaves the network, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server.</p>"
