abstract:
- content: "<p>The continued growth of large-scale data centers has resulted in a
    wide range of architectures and designs. Each design is tuned to address the challenges
    and requirements of the specific applications and workload that the data is being
    built for. Each design evolves as engineering solutions are developed to workaround
    limitations of existing protocols, hardware, as well as software implementations.
    The goal of this document is to characterize this problem space in detail in order
    to better understand if there is any gap in making address resolution scale in
    various network designs for data centers. In particular it is our goal to peel
    back the various optimization and engineering solutions to develop generalized
    reference architectures for a data center. We also discuss the various factors
    that influence design choices in developing various data center designs.</p>"
