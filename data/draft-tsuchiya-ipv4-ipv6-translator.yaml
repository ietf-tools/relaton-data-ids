abstract:
- content: "<p>In the late stage of the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, IPv4 lands are
    interconnected by IPv6 ocean and it is necessary for an IPv4 node and an IPv6
    to communicate directly. This memo proposes a mechanism to enable such direct
    communication with extension name servers, an address mapper, and translators
    for each IPv4 land.</p>"
