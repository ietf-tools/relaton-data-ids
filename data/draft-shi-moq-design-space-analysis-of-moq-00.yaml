abstract:
- content: "<p>This document investigates potential solution directions within the
    charter scope of MoQ WG. MoQ aims to provide low-latency, efficient media delivery
    solution for use cases including live streaming, gaming and video conferencing.
    To achieve low-latency media transfer efficiently, the network topology of relay
    nodes and the computation done at the relay nodes should be considered carefully.
    This document provides the analysis of those factors which can help the design
    of the MoQ protocols.</p>"
