abstract:
- content: "<p>Longstanding work in the Mobile IP Working Group has been directed
    at enhancements to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 to reduce the amount of latency
    in binding updates sent to the Home Agent and, for route- optimization, Correspondent
    Nodes, upon Care of Address change. In cases where the Home Agent and Mobile Node
    are separated by continental or transcontinental distances, this latency can be
    rather high and can interfere with the Mobile Node receiving its traffic upon
    Care of Address change when break-before-make handover is required. This draft
    discusses a solution that leverages the more recent fast handover work and mechanisms
    already described in the protocol specifications for Mobile IPv6 and the route
    optimization extension of Mobile IPv4. This alternative has certain simplicity,
    scalability, and robustness advantages over a design that incorporates additional
    mobility agents, and requires no additional mechanism in the network or change
    to the Mobile Node beyond that required to support these protocols.</p>"
