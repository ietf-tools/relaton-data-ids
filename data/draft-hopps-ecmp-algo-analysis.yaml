abstract:
- content: "<p>Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) is a routing technique for routing packets
    along multiple paths of equal cost. The forwarding engine identifies paths by
    next-hop. When forwarding a packet the router must decide which next-hop (path)
    to use. This document gives an analysis of one method for making that decision.
    The analysis includes the performance of the algorithm and the disruption caused
    by changes to the set of next-hops. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
