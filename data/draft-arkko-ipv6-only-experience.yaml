abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses our experiences from moving a small number
    of users to an IPv6-only network, with access to the IPv4-only parts of the Internet
    via a NAT64 device. The document covers practical experiences as well as roadblocks
    and opportunities for this type of a network setup. The document also makes some
    recommendations about where such networks are applicable and what should be taken
    into account in the network design. The document also discusses further work that
    is needed to make IPv6-only networking applicable in all environments. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
