abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a detailed framework for composing and aggregating
    metrics (both in time and in space) originally defined by the IP Performance Metrics
    (IPPM), RFC 2330, and developed by the IETF. This new framework memo describes
    the generic composition and aggregation mechanisms. The memo provides a basis
    for additional documents that implement the framework to define detailed compositions
    and aggregations of metrics that are useful in practice. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
