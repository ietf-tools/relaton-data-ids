abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the steps a host takes in deciding how to autoconfigure
    its interfaces in IP version 6. The autoconfiguration process includes creating
    a link-local address and verifying its uniqueness on a link, determining what
    information should be autoconfigured (addresses, other information, or both),
    and in the case of addresses, whether they should be obtained through the stateless
    mechanism, the stateful mechanism, or both. This document defines the process
    for generating a link-local address, the process for generating site-local and
    global addresses via stateless address autoconfiguration, and the Duplicate Address
    Detection procedure. The details of autoconfiguration using the stateful protocol
    are specified elsewhere.</p>"
