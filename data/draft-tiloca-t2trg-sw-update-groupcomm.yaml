abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method for efficiently distributing a software
    update to multiple target devices, by using end-to-end secure group communication
    over UDP and IP multicast. To this end, the defined method relies on a number
    of building blocks developed in the Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Working
    Group of the IETF. Those especially include the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Block-wise transfers for CoAP, and the end-to-end security protocol Group
    Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE). The method
    defined in this document is compatible with (but not dependent on) the architecture
    for software and firmware update developed in the Software Updates for Internet
    of Things (SUIT) Working Group of the IETF.</p>"
