abstract:
- content: "<p>The 'Show me the numbers: Workshop on Analyzing IETF Data (AID)' was
    convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from November 29 to December
    2 and hosted by the IN-SIGHT.it project at the University of Amsterdam, however,
    converted to an online only event. The workshop was conducted based on two discussion
    parts and a hackathon activity in between. This report summarizes the workshop's
    discussion and identifies topics that warrant future work and consideration. Note
    that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and
    positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and
    do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.</p>"
