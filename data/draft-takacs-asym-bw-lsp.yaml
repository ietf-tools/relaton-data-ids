abstract:
- content: "<p>GMPLS provides general connection control functionality supporting
    different network technologies. This memo specifies a further generalization to
    support bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric requirements. The extension improves
    the flexibility of bidirectional LSP establishment and at the same time simplifies
    the control and management of asymmetric services.</p>"
