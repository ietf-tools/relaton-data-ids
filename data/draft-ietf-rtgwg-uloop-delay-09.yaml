abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols
    that prevents local transient forwarding loops in case of link failure. This mechanism
    proposes a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the convergence
    of the node adjacent to the topology change and the network-wide convergence.
    Because this mechanism delays the IGP convergence, it may only be used for planned
    maintenance or when Fast Reroute (FRR) protects the traffic during the time between
    the link failure and the IGP convergence. The mechanism is limited to the link-down
    event in order to keep the mechanism simple. Simulations using real network topologies
    have been performed and show that local loops are a significant portion (&gt;50%)
    of the total forwarding loops.</p>"
