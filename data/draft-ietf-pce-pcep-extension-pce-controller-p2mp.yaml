abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCE is a core component of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) systems.
    The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination
    of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs). A PCE-based
    Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control
    plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing
    it. Thus, the P2MP LSP can be calculated/set up/initiated, and the label-forwarding
    entries can also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
    device along the P2MP path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much
    as possible. This document specifies the procedures and PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the central controller for provisioning
    labels along the path of the static P2MP LSP.</p>"
