abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM, RFC6376) permits claiming some responsibility
    for a message by cryptographically associating a domain name with the message.
    For data covered by the cryptographic signature, this also enables detecting changes
    made during transit. DKIM survives basic email relaying. In a Replay Attack, a
    recipient of a DKIM-signed message re-posts the message to other recipients, while
    retaining the original, validating signature, and thereby leveraging the reputation
    of the original signer. This document discusses the resulting damage to email
    delivery, interoperability, and associated mail flows. A significant challenge
    to mitigating this problem is that it is difficult for receivers to differentiate
    between legitimate forwarding flows and a DKIM Replay Attack.</p>"
