abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) specification allows for
    the authentication of management operations by a variety of authentication algorithms.
    This memo defines two strategies for administering SNMP communities based upon
    either the SNMP authentication algorithm or the SNMP authentication and privacy
    algorithm. Insofar as the administration of SNMP communities based upon the trivial
    authentication algorithm may be realized by straightforward application of familiar
    network management techniques, administration of such communities is not directly
    addressed in this memo.</p>"
