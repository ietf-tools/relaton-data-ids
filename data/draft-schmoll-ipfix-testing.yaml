abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a list of tests which implementers of IP Flow
    Information Export (IPFIX) compliant systems are encouraged to perform on their
    IPFIX system. This document has been created to help implementers test the functionality
    of their IPFIX exporter and/or collector component. The goal of these tests is
    to ensure that all important functions are covered by tests and thereby to gain
    a level of confidence in the system which allows the implementer to perform interoperabilty
    or plug tests with other IPFIX systems.</p>"
