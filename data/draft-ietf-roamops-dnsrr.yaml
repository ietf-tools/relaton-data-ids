abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the Roaming Relationship (REL) record
    in the DNS for the description of roaming relationships. REL resource records
    may be used for determining the existence of a roaming relationship path between
    the local ISP and the user's home domain, as well as the location of an appropriate
    accounting agent. However, unless the roaming relationship path is authenticated
    by some method (such as via tokens or certificates returned by the home authentication
    server), hierarchical authentication routing must be used in order to validate
    the path.</p>"
