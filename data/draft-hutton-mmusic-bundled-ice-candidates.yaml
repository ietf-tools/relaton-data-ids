abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with
    an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of bundled media,
    which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for multiple RTP streams. In a scenario
    where a party initiating the negotiation supports ICE [RFC5245] this mechanism
    provides the ability to provide an SDP offer which is both backwards compatible
    and able to fully specify the use of bundled media. Therefore, this mechanism
    allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a single offer/answer
    exchange when both parties support ICE and this extension. The mechanism complements
    the procedures described in [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].</p>"
