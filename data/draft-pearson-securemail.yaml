abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an Applicability Statement for Securemail, a
    framework proposal for secure transmission and better authentication of email
    based on current Internet standards. The SecureMail framework proposes the use
    of Transaction Layer Security (TLS), the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender
    ID to support secure email communication between internet servers with some assurance
    of the authenticity of the message sender. Comments are solicited and should be
    addressed to the mailing list at securemail-discuss@googlegroups.com and/or the
    authors.</p>"
