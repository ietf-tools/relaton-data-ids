abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 capable mobile nodes can roam between networks that belong
    to their home service provider as well as others. Roaming in foreign networks
    is enabled as a result of the service level and roaming agreements that exist
    between operators. One of the key protocols that allows this kind of a roaming
    mechanism to be enabled is Diameter. This Internet Draft specifies a new application
    to Diameter that enables Mobile IPv6 roaming in networks other than its home.</p>"
