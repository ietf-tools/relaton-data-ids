abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol to allow
    clients to create and write files with greater efficiency. The proposed extension
    allows the server to defer creating the file on stable storage when replying to
    an OPEN call. The aim is to improve server efficiency and scalability by reducing
    the number of required disk accesses when writing a file from scratch.Keywords
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
