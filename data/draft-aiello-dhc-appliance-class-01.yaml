abstract:
- content: "<p>The Appliance Class Identifier option is used by a Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP) client to identify the type of appliance it is. The information
    contained in this option is an opaque field that represents the appliance class
    of which the client belongs. Based on this class, a DHCP server selects the appropriate
    address pool to assign an address and the appropriate configuration parameters
    to the client. The value of this option should be selected by the appliance manufacturer
    and included in the DHCP Discover/Request messages. Multiple vendors may choose
    to use the same appliance class identifier for like appliances (an IP phone for
    example).</p>"
