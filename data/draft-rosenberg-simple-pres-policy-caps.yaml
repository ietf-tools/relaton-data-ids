abstract:
- content: "<p>An important component of presence services is policy. Policy systems
    allow the presentity to grant access to specific pieces of information to specific
    watchers. To allow for interoperability between clients which set such policies,
    and servers which execute them, it is necessary for clients to be able to determine
    the capabilities of the server to which it is connected. This specification defines
    a set of Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements for expressing presence policy
    capabilities.</p>"
