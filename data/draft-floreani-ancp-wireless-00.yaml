abstract:
- content: "<p>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) has been developed primarily
    for the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) environment, with varying line conditions
    where the system that uses ANCP consists of DSLAMs (DSL access multiplexers) and
    terminal equipment. In this scenario, the channel conditions on subscriber lines
    vary, forcing changes and adaptations in line rates at the modem equipment, and
    affecting services offered. Satellite communications service providers have very
    similar issues and are also based around hubs, with satellite terminals. This
    application of ANCP could also be extended to point- to-point radio services in
    both the satellite and terrestrial domain.</p>"
