abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to
    increasing demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and operational
    practices must be updated. This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay
    Network (IRON) that supports sustainable growth while requiring no changes to
    end systems and no changes to the existing routing system. IRON further addresses
    other important issues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming,
    traffic engineering and NAT traversal. While business considerations are an important
    determining factor for widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.
    This document is a product of the IRTF Routing Research Group. This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
