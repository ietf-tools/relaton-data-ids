abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, the use of IPv6 anycast is limited. This document proposes a
    mechanism by which TCP/SCTP and stateful protocols using UDP can securely discover
    the mapping from an anycast address to a unicast address that can be used until
    a failure is detected. The mechanism reuses the Mobile IPv6 Return Routability
    and Binding Update mechanism.</p>"
