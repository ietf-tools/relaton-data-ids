abstract:
- content: "<p>A drawback with many NAT UDP hole punching techniques is the keepalive
    traffic necessary to keep the UDP binding open. It it necessary to send keepalives
    frequently because it is not possible to determine or modify the NAT's binding
    lifetime. This keepalive traffic causes server load and additional network traffic,
    which is especially problematic with battery-operated wireless devices. This document
    describes two mechanisms to discover NATs and firewalls and a mechanism to query
    and control their binding lifetime. With these mechanisms, UDP binding discovery
    and UDP keepalive traffic can be reduced to involve only the necessary NATs or
    firewalls. This eliminates the keepalive traffic to servers, and vastly reduces
    keepalive traffic across the network. At the same time, backwards compatibility
    with NATs and firewalls that do not support this specification is retained, which
    allows for incremental deployment of this mechanism. This document is discussed
    on the SAFE mailing list, &lt;http://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/safe&gt;.</p>"
