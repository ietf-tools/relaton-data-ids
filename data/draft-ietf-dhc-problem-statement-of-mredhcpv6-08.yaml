abstract:
- content: "<p>IP addresses assume an increasing number of attributes as communication
    identifiers to meet different requirements. Privacy protection, accountability,
    security, and manageability of networks can be supported by extending the DHCPv6
    protocol as required. This document provides current extension practices and typical
    DHCPv6 server software in terms of extensions, defines a general model of DHCPv6,
    discusses some extension points, and presents extension cases.</p>"
