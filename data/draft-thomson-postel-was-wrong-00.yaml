abstract:
- content: <p>Jon Postel's famous statement in RFC 1122 of "Be liberal in what you
    accept, and conservative in what you send" - is a principle that has long guided
    the design of Internet protocols and implementations of those protocols. The posture
    this statement advocates might promote interoperability in the short term, but
    that short term advantage is outweighed by negative consequences that affect the
    long term maintenance of a protocol and its ecosystem.</p>
