abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the privacy mechanisms for the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP). Specifically, guidelines are provided for the creation of messages
    that do not divulge personal identity information. A "privacy service" logical
    role for intermediaries is defined to answer some privacy requirements that user
    agents cannot satisfy themselves. Finally, means are presented by which a user
    can request particular functions from a privacy service.</p>
