abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions for HIP mobility and multihoming mechanisms
    to operate in network environments with NAT devices. The extensions are based
    on the ICE protocol that allows two communicating end-hosts to establish a direct
    communications path with each other even when residing in separate private address
    realms. The focus of the extensions in this document is on fault- tolerance with
    symmetric locator pairs, and load-balancing is also discussed. This document also
    updates RFC5206.</p>"
