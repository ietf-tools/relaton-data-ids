abstract:
- content: "<p>Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)
    to enable direct client access to file data on storage devices and bypass the
    NFSv4 server. This can increase both performance and parallelism, but it requires
    additional client functionality, some of which depends upon the type of storage
    used. The pNFS specification for block storage (RFC 5663) describes how clients
    can identify the volumes used for pNFS, but this mechanism requires communication
    with the NFSv4 server. This document updates RFC 5663 to add a mechanism that
    enables identification of block storage devices used by pNFS file systems without
    communicating with the server. This enables clients to control access to pNFS
    block devices when the client initially boots, as opposed to waiting until the
    client can communicate with the NFSv4 server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
