abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a Credential Service that allows Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP package to discover the certificates
    of other users. This mechanism allows user agents that want to contact a given
    Address-of-Record (AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the
    Credential Service. The Credential Service also allows users to store and retrieve
    their own certificates and private keys.</p>"
