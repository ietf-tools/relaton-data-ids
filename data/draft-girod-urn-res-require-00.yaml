abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents a set of requirements for systems that resolve
    URNs into hints for locating resources. Hints are a type of metadata that provide
    information about locating a resource, including but not limited to URLs and pointers
    to other resolution systems. The requirements fall into three broad areas: usability,
    security, and evolvability. With those in mind, the paper reviews what we have
    been able to learn about the NAPTR proposal. The NAPTR proposal has grown out
    of a set of several different URN resolution proposals; it uses the existing DNS
    infrastructure to store and serve resolution information. To this end they introduce
    a new kind of DNS entry called a NAPTR, or Naming Authority PoinTeR. The review
    of the NAPTR proposal includes our wishlist for extensions and modifications to
    it that would add evolutionary paths to the design without sacrificing ease of
    implementation. The paper then presents a sketch of a more extensive URN resolution
    system, presented in order to demonstrate the need for evolution in any URN resolution
    proposal.</p>"
