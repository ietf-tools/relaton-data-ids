- content: "<p>This document describes an extensible mechanism to support Address
    Families in OSPFv3. One undefined field in the Router-LSA is used to define the
    address-families on a link. A router may participate in multiple address families
    on different links. This information needs to be advertised so that only applicable
    link are used in the SPF calculation when building an address family specific
    shortest path tree.</p>"
