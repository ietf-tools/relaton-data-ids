abstract:
- content: "<p>In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-
    related data. Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP receivers usually
    cannot start consuming the multicast data right after they join the session. Thus,
    they often experience a random acquisition delay. An RTP receiver can use one
    or more different approaches to achieve rapid acquisition. Yet, due to various
    factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies. Furthermore,
    in some cases, the RTP receiver can do a simple multicast join (in other cases,
    it is compelled to do so). For quality reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic purposes,
    it is important to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers about their
    acquisition and presentation experiences. This document addresses this issue by
    defining a new report block type, called the Multicast Acquisition (MA) report
    block, within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs)
    (RFC 3611). This document also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report
    block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
