abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to pinpoint the work scope of Intelligence Driven
    Network (IDN) and mine the potential standardization work. Firstly, the problems
    and new requirements for the existing methods are analyzed. Numbers of high value
    use-cases are proposed as examples to instantiate them. A benchmark framework
    design is proposed, which is important during the machine learning and inference
    process. Finally, a reference model of IDN is proposed, based on which the potential
    standardization work is analyzed.</p>"
