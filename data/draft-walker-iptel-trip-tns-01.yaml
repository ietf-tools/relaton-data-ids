abstract:
- content: "<p>Conventional telephony signalling commonly uses E.164 addresses to
    route calls to their destination. However, selection of the signalling and media
    paths can be influenced by other considerations. Some such considerations may
    be user specified, and may differ from that which the network operator would normally
    choose. In some cases, support for such user-specified options may be required
    by national regulation. The choice of Transit Network (e.g. selection of long
    distance carrier) is such a case. This draft describes three ways that a Transit
    Network Selection (or TNS) mechanism can be added to the TRIP protocol.</p>"
