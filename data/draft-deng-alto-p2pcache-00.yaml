abstract:
- content: "<p>Transparent forwarding caching effectively localizes the downloading
    P2P traffic within the sub-net under its coverage resulting in reduction of network
    cost for cross-boundary peer selection, whereas transparent reverse caching blocks
    the uploading traffic outside a wireless sub-net leading to elimination of network
    cost for wireless uploading peer selection. In other words, caching between pairs
    of endpoints changes the traffic cost along the way. Therefore, it is proposed
    to use locations of caches as dividers of different DIPs to guide intra-ISP network
    abstraction and mark costs among them according to the location and type of relevant
    caches.</p>"
