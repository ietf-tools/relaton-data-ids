abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an applicability statement for the use of UDP
    transport checksums with IPv6. It defines recommendations and requirements for
    the use of IPv6 UDP datagrams with a zero UDP checksum. It describes the issues
    and design principles that need to be considered when UDP is used with IPv6 to
    support tunnel encapsulations, and it examines the role of the IPv6 UDP transport
    checksum. The document also identifies issues and constraints for deployment on
    network paths that include middleboxes. An appendix presents a summary of the
    trade-offs that were considered in evaluating the safety of the update to RFC
    2460 that changes the use of the UDP checksum with IPv6.</p>"
