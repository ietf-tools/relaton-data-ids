abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the reservation of the IPv6 address block f000::/4
    for structured internal-use networking. This allocation extends the concepts of
    Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) as defined in RFC 4193, acknowledging the growing
    demand for a larger, more hierarchically organised, and clearly non-internet-routable
    address space for internal networks. The reservation of f000::/4 would prevent
    future conflicts with public allocations and provide operational clarity to large-scale,
    privacy-focused, or non-public infrastructures.</p>"
