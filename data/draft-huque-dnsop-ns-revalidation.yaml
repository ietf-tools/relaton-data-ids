abstract:
- content: "<p>This document recommends improved DNS [RFC1034] [RFC1035] resolver
    behavior with respect to the processing of Name Server (NS) resource record sets
    (RRset) during iterative resolution. When following a referral response from an
    authoritative server to a child zone, DNS resolvers should explicitly query the
    authoritative NS RRset at the apex of the child zone and cache this in preference
    to the NS RRset on the parent side of the zone cut. Resolvers should also periodically
    revalidate the child delegation by re-quering the parent zone at the expiration
    of the TTL of the parent side NS RRset.</p>"
