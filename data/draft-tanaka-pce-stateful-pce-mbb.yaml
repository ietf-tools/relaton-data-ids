abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) and its corresponding protocol
    extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do stateful control of Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP). Stateful
    PCE supports manipulating of the existing LSP's state and attributes (e.g., bandwidth
    and path) via delegation and also instantiation of new LSPs in the network via
    PCE Initiation procedures. In the current MPLS TE network using Resource ReSerVation
    Protocol (RSVP-TE), LSPs are often controlled by Make-before-break (M-B-B) signaling
    by the headend for the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization. In most
    cases, it is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without any data disruption.
    This document specifies the procedure of applying stateful PCE's control to make-before-break
    RSVP-TE signaling. In this document, two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures
    are defined, implicit mode and explicit mode. This document also specifies the
    usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol) messages, expected
    behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and necessary extensions of additional PCEP
    objects.</p>"
