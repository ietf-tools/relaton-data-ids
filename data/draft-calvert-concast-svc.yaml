abstract:
- content: "<p>Concast is a many-to-one best-effort network service that allows a
    receiver to treat a group of senders as a single entity, in much the same way
    that IP multicast allows a sender to treat a group of receivers as one. Each concast
    datagram delivered to a receiver is derived from (possibly many) datagrams sent
    by different members of the concast group to that receiver, according to a 'merge
    specification'. Concast allows the semantics of this merging operation to vary
    to suit the needs of different applications. This document describes the concast
    service and presents a framework for defining merge semantics. It also describes
    the processing of concast datagrams by concast-capable routers and hosts. The
    concast signaling protocol (CSP), an integral part of the concast service, is
    specified in a separate document.</p>"
