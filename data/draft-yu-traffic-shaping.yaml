abstract:
- content: "<p>Starting from the traffic shaping mechanism, one of the core technologies
    of network deterministic assurance, we summarize the characteristics of different
    traffic scheduling and shaping methods and propose a solution design for IPv6
    to carry these traffic scheduling and shaping methods, taking into account deterministic
    and security factors. At the same time, the network scope of practical applications
    is becoming larger and larger, and the demand for deterministic network services
    will no longer be restricted to LANs, but will require deterministic forwarding
    beyond LAN boundaries, extending the deterministic assurance capability previously
    provided in LANs to WANs through network layer technologies.</p>"
