abstract:
- content: "<p>Voice call continuity and media over IP session mobility operations
    are typically characterized by the movement of a specific segment of a communication
    session across networks and/or devices. This movement may be implemented through
    the use of SIP procedures that result in the establishment of a new segment replacing
    the existing segment. This document proposes a private extension to the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enable User Agents (UA) to indicate that a SIP
    request is associated with a mobility operation for an existing session.</p>"
