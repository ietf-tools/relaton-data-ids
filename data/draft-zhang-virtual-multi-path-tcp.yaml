- content: "<p>Traditional MPTCP [RFC6824] requires that at least one node in a pair
    should equipped more than one NIC, and this limits the deployment [RFC6182] of
    MPTCP. This document proposes the VMPTCP (Virtual Multi-Path TCP) and describes
    how to build TCP sub-connections in VMPTCP among nodes with just one NIC.</p>"
