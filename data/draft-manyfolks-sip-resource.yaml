abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how network QoS and security establishment
    can be made a precondition to sessions initiated by the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP), and described by SDP. These preconditions require that the participant
    reserve network resources (or establish a secure media channel) before continuing
    with the session. We do not define new QoS reservation or security mechanisms;
    these pre- conditions simply require a participant to use existing resource reservation
    and security mechanisms before beginning the session.</p>"
