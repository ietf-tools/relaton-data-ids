abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some high level use cases and scenarios with
    requirements on delay sensitive and deterministic networking. Not only the telecom
    industry but also vertical industries have been investigated. In addition to the
    5G networking, industrial automation, automotive industry, media and gaming industry
    are typical related industries believed to be representative for the technical
    requirements on ultra-fast and ultra-reliability communications.</p>"
