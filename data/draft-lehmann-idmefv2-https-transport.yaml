abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Detection Message Exchange Format version 2 (IDMEFv2)
    defines a date representation for security incidents detected on cyber and/or
    physical infrastructures. The format is agnostic so it can be used in standalone
    or combined cyber (SIEM), physical (PSIM) and availability (NMS) monitoring systems.
    IDMEFv2 can also be used to represent man made or natural hazards threats. IDMEFv2
    improves situational awareness by facilitating correlation of multiple types of
    events using the same base format thus enabling efficient detection of complex
    and combined cyber and physical attacks and incidents. This document defines a
    way to transport IDMEFv2 Alerts over HTTPs. If approved this document would obsolete
    RFC4767.</p>"
