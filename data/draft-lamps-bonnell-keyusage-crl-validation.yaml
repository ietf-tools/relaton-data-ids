abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5280 defines the profile of X.509 certificates and certificate
    revocation lists (CRLs) for use in the Internet. This profile requires that certificates
    which certify keys for signing CRLs contain the key usage extension with the cRLSign
    bit asserted. Additionally, RFC 5280 defines steps for the validation of CRLs.
    While there is a requirement for CRL validators to verify that the cRLSign bit
    is asserted in the keyUsage extension of the CRL issuer's certificate, there is
    no requirement for validators to verify the presence of the keyUsage extension
    itself. The lack of this requirement will cause verifiers that implement the RFC
    5280 CRL validation algorithm to accept a CRL which is signed by a certificate
    with no keyUsage extension, and therefore does not explicitly have the cRLSign
    bit asserted. This document specifies an enhancement to the CRL validation process
    to explicitly require the presence of the keyUsage extension in CRL issuer certificates
    to resolve this issue.</p>"
