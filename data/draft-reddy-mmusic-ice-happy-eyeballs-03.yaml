abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an algorithm that makes Interactive Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE) connectivity checks more responsive by reducing delays in
    dual-stack host ICE connectivity checks when there is a path failure for an address
    family preferred by the application or by the operating system. As IPv6 is usually
    preferred over IPv4, the procedures in this document helps avoid user- noticeable
    delays when the IPv6 path is broken or excessively slow.</p>"
