abstract:
- content: "<p>Email abuse often relies on unauthorized use of a domain name, such
    as one belonging to a well-known company (brand). SPF and DKIM provide basic domain
    name authentication methods for email. A recent industry effort built an additional
    authentication-based layer, called Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting
    &amp; Conformance (DMARC). It allows a sender to indicate that their emails are
    protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiver what to do if neither of those
    authentication methods passes; it also provides a reporting mechanism, from receivers
    back to domain owners. Such capabilities over the public Internet are unusual
    and their use is not yet well-understood. This document formulates a set of best
    practices for the use of DMARC.</p>"
