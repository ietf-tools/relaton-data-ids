abstract:
- content: "<p>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of
    conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to
    the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end- to-end messaging. These
    include, but are not limited to, key management, key discovery, and private key
    handling (including peer- to-peer synchronization of private keys and other user
    data across devices). Human Rights-enabling principles like data minimization,
    end-to-end and interoperability are explicit design goals. For the goal of usable
    privacy, pEp introduces means to verify communication between peers and proposes
    a trust-rating system to denote secure types of communications and signal the
    privacy level available on a per-user and per-message level. Significantly, the
    pEp protocols build on already available security formats and message transports
    (e.g., PGP/MIME with email), and are written with the intent to be interoperable
    with already widely-deployed systems in order to ease adoption and implementation.
    This document outlines the general design choices and principles of pEp.</p>"
