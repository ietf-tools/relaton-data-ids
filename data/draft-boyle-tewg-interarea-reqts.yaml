abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineering using MPLS within a single IGP area has become
    quite prevalent in networks today. This gives a network operator several advantages,
    including better traffic measurement capabilities, faster restoration times, and
    of course the ability to better manage congestion points within their network.
    However, the current uses have been limited to one IGP area. OSPF based networks
    usually do traffic engineering only in their backbone area, and many ISIS networks
    still operate at a single level. It would be useful to be able to extend these
    capabilities across hierarchical areas within a single IGP, as well as to be able
    to extend across AS boundaries if it is found to be useful and possible. This
    document first considers current applications of MPLS traffic engineering (TE),
    and then it addresses how these might be used (or precluded) across IGP areas.
    For the purposes of this document, IGP areas refers both to OSPF areas and ISIS
    multi-level hierarchies. Requirements for Inter-AS TE can be found in [INTER-AS-TE].
