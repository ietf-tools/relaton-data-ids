abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the distribution mechanism of route optimization
    hints, which can be used by a mobile node to determine when the node should initiate
    the route optimization procedure when communicating with correspondent nodes.
    Usually, a mobile node will perform RO procedure to any correspondent node as
    described in Mobile IPv6 specification [1]. However, in some cases, it is better
    not to perform RO. A typical example is a firewalled network. This memo also describes
    a configuration of a firewall which makes mobile nodes possible to move between
    an intranet and the Internet by using RO hints.</p>"
