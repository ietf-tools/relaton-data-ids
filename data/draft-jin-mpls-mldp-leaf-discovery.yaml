abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for a root node to discover the
    leaf nodes of an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP. Such kind of function could be used
    for multiplexing/aggregating root initiated and leaf initiated application which
    will use mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP. Examples of root initiated applications are
    P2MP PW [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS multicast [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN
    multicast [RFC6513]. And examples of leaf initiated applications are statically
    configured mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP, mLDP in-band signaling [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling].</p>"
