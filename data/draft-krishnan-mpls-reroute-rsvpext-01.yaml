abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the extensions that enables RSVP to support
    creation of an alternative label switched path to handle fast data packet reroute
    upon failure in a primary label switched path in an Multi-protocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) network as described in [3]. As such, this draft is a companion draft to
    [3]. The proposed extensions present no backward compatibility issues.</p>"
