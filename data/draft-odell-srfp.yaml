- content: "<p>The Simple Record Framing Protocol (SRFP) is designed to provide a
    common, light-weight protocol for sending record-structured data of possibly indeterminate
    size over a reliable (TCP) connection. It is designed to be a 'nickel's worth
    of presentation layer' which can be incorporated into a simple library to prevent
    reinvention of wheels.</p>"
