abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform
    the network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.
    Today, network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by
    dropping packets or by ECN markings, and the receiver passes this information
    back to the sender in transport-layer feedback. The mechanism described here enables
    the sender to also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band
    at the IP layer, such that the total amount of congestion from all elements on
    the path is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where it could, for example,
    be used to provide input to traffic management. This mechanism is called congestion
    exposure or ConEx. The companion document "ConEx Concepts and Use Cases" provides
    the entry-point to the set of ConEx documentation.</p>
