abstract:
- content: "<p>Object Naming Service (ONS) is a network service that leverages Domain
    Name System (DNS) to discover information about a product and related services
    from the Electronic Product Code (EPC). Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service
    (ESDS) is an application layer protocol for the distributed sharing and discovery
    of notification events between associated partners within a supply chain. Unlike
    DNS or ONS, where there is a known set of root servers, ESDS will have numerous
    roots for various supply chains operating globally. ONS can be used in collaboration
    with ESDS to make the multiple ESDS roots be found easily. This document is intended
    to extend the ONS to support ESDS by defining a new Naming Authority PoinTeR (NAPTR)
    service type of ONS for ESDS.</p>"
