abstract:
- content: "<p>In a network comprising thousands of BGP peers exchanging millions
    of routes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop. Given the large
    scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after failure in a time period
    that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. This document describes an
    architecture by which traffic can be re- routed to equal cost multi-path (ECMP)
    or pre-calculated backup paths in a timeframe that does not depend on the number
    of BGP prefixes. The objective is achieved through organizing the forwarding data
    structures in a hierarchical manner and sharing forwarding elements among the
    maximum possible number of routes. The described technique yields prefix independent
    convergence while ensuring incremental deployment, complete automation, and zero
    management and provisioning effort. It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits
    of BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (BGP-PIC) are hinged on the existence of
    more than one path whether as ECMP or primary-backup.</p>"
