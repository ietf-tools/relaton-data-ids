abstract:
- content: "<p>SRTP Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) is an extension to SRTP that provides
    for the secure transport of SRTP master keys, Rollover Counters, and other information,
    within SRTP or SRTCP. This facility enables SRTP to work for decentralized conferences
    with minimal control, and to handle situations caused by early media. This note
    defines EKT, and also describes how to use it with SDP Security Descriptions,
    DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR), and MIKEY. These other key management protocols
    provide an EKT key to everyone in a session, and EKT coordinates the keys within
    the session.</p>"
