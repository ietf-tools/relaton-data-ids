abstract:
- content: "<p>Service chains specifying the ordered sequences of network functions
    according to network policies requested, play a very important role in improving
    network performance in most networks. With the introduction of Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, service
    chains can be immediately deployed in more effective ways. Since different customers
    or operators would request multiple service chains in the same network but different
    administrative domains, and the multiple service chains may apply to the same
    network connection, we propose a service chain aggregation architecture that has
    ability to effectively aggregate them before the deployment. In this architecture,
    we determine the aggregating order of service chains according to different conditions
    verifying the aggregation effectiveness. The benefits of our architecture are
    1) security, 2) network resource (e.g., flow entries in switches) savings and
    3) scalability.</p>"
