abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile-IP, together with several other supporting standards such as
    Reverse Tunneling and the Challenge-Response extensions, have all been recently
    revised. Although such revisions are for the most part backward compatible with
    the original versions, sometimes static configuration of Mobile Nodes and Mobility
    Agents is required to ensure smooth transition and avoid any possible conflict
    between different standard versions implemented by already-deployed equipment.
    In this draft we define compatibility extensions for Mobile-IP Agent Advertisement,
    Registration Request and Registration Reply messages that allow all Mobile-IPv4
    entities to dynamically synchronize their 'compatibility versions', defined as
    the versions of the Mobile-IP standards that a particular node is able to support.
    This solution offers a dynamic mechanism which informs all entities involved in
    a Mobile-IP exchange of the version of the standard they support, therefore reducing
    the need to statically configure such information at Mobile Nodes or Mobility
    Agents</p>"
