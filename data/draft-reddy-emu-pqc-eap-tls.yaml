abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes enhancements to the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol with Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) and EAP Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS)
    to incorporate post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms. It also addresses challenges
    related to large certificate sizes and long certificate chains, as identified
    in RFC9191, and provides recommendations for integrating PQC algorithms into EAP-TLS
    and EAP- TTLS deployments.</p>"
