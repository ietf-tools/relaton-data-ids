abstract:
- content: "<p>Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 networks securely is
    available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal network. However,
    IPv6 presents some new security challenges. RFC 4942 describes the security issues
    in the protocol, but network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded
    document to enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain choices. This
    document analyzes the operational security issues associated with several types
    of network and proposes technical and procedural mitigation techniques. This document
    is only applicable to managed networks, such as enterprise networks. The recommendations
    in this document are not applicable to residential user cases, even in cases where
    a Service Provider may be managing the home gateway.</p>"
