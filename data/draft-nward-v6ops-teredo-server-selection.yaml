abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes performance, reliability and privacy problems
    inherent when using a remotely situated vendor-provided Teredo server, which is
    a common default in current implementations, and then discussed why configuring
    servers manually is bad and difficult. It recommends two partial solutions, and
    gives a final recommendation combining both solutions using anycast IPv4 and a
    well known DNS hostname.</p>"
