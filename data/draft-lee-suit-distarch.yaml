abstract:
- content: "<p>The management of data is entirely centralized on servers in a server
    client model which leads the servers to be high-value targets for adversaries.
    Also, firmware consumers fail to download the latest firmware image if the author
    is disappeared in the server client model. The distribution of network for managing
    the manifest and firmware image files thus required. This draft introduces a distributed
    SUIT architecture model, which utilizes blockchains to resolve the issues of the
    server client model for SUIT.</p>"
