abstract:
- content: "<p>When delivering audio and video data through low capacity links, it
    is important to optimally exploit the limited resources in order to provide the
    best possible user experience. QoS aspects in this respect might relate to the
    pure audio and video quality, as well as to delay and lip-sync. The actual weights
    of the different QoS aspects depend on the service being offered, and are out
    of the scope of this document. In order to optimally exploit the limited resources,
    it is necessary to get a reasonable precise measurement of them. This document
    proposes metrics to address this problem. This document, in this initial draft,
    focuses only on the semantic aspects, leaving out the syntactical details.</p>"
