abstract:
- content: "<p>Many music libraries, music centers, authors societies, music publishers,
    music shops, broadcasting companies and public need to share bibliographic musical
    records. No standard format exists and exchanging musical records involves an
    important pre- and/or post-processing of these data. Searching, sorting and cataloging
    music bibliographical records does not currently follow any standard. The researcher
    needs, in each library and each music information center, to use different procedure.
    In some cases, it is just impossible to obtain the targeted result. This document
    defines the requirements for a standard musical bibliographic format.</p>"
