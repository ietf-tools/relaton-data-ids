abstract:
- content: "<p>Multihomed mobile nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment to multiple
    access networks. In this case, a PMIPv6-enabled local mobility anchor should distribute
    the application traffic to a proper access network which the mobile nodes wish
    to receive from. This document specifies how mobile nodes send their desire of
    flow movement to an attached mobile access gateway, which then relays it to a
    local mobility anchor.</p>"
