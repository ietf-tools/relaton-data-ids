abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification designs an architecture that aims at load balancing
    flows along multiple routes according to a measure of their average traffic loads.
    This architecture supports such a service due to the operation in a closed loop
    of an enhanced routing control plane with an enhanced forwarding plane. Basically,
    this routing paradigm allows a second dynamic metric called load to be taken into
    account when calculating new routes and when forwarding the flows along the routes.</p>"
