- content: "<p>This Internet Draft is one of a pair written at the request of one
    of the SPIRITS Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion on what extended
    functionality SPIRITS may be used to provide; the PINT work has similar requirements
    for a definition of the building blocks that might be used in future services
    (and so need to be supported by the protocol). This note provides the 'mirror
    image' of the associated SPIRITS draft, listing functional building blocks that
    may be executed in response to future PINT protocol requests.</p>"
