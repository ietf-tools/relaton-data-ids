abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes modifications to the AES-GCM algorithm to allow
    separation of the data authenticity and data confidentiality keys, while preserving
    the performance benefits of the algorithm. When AES-GCM is applied to network
    protocols such as IPsec and TLS, separation of these keys allows the data confidentiality
    key to be shared with trusted intermediary nodes on the network, while preserving
    the data authenticity functions in an end-to-end manner. The current definition
    of AES-GCM uses a single key for confidentiality and authenticity hence it is
    not possible to share the key with trusted network nodes, without compromising
    the data authenticity functions.</p>"
