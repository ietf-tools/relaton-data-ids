abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) operation for
    first hop routers. In this context, MCOP may be used as a tool for multicast network
    management. MCOP provides multicast network remote management with centralized
    information database located at Multicast Control Server (MCS). It allows gradual,
    group and network specific multicast network deployment. The control is done by
    MCOP enabled first hop routers, Multicast Control Clients (MCC), based on the
    information received from the MCS. MCC can filter IGMP/MLD reports and multicast
    packets before they reach the IGMP/MLD processing layer or multicast routing stack
    of the router. MCOP is independent of multicast routing protocols.</p>"
