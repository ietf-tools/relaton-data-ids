abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers a VPN End User establishing an IPsec SA with
    a Security Gateway using the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2),
    where at least one of the peers has multiple interfaces or where Security Gateway
    is a cluster with each node having its own IP address. With the current IKEv2
    protocol, the outer IP addresses of the IPsec SA are determined by those used
    by IKE SA. As a result using multiple interfaces requires to set up an IKE SA
    on each interface, or on each path if both the VPN Client and the Security Gateway
    have multiple interfaces. Setting each IKE SA involves authentications which might
    require multiple round trips as well as activity from the VPN End User and thus
    would delay the VPN establishment. In addition multiple authentications unnecessarily
    increase the load on the VPN client and the authentication infrastructure. This
    document presents the solution that allows to clone IKEv2 SA, where an additional
    SA is derived from an existing one. The newly created IKE SA is set without the
    IKEv2 authentication exchange. This IKE SA can later be assigned to another interface
    or moved to another cluster mode using MOBIKE protocol.</p>"
