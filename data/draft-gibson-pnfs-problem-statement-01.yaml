abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft considers the problem of limited bandwidth to NFS servers.
    The bandwidth limitation exists because an NFS server has limited network, CPU,
    memory and disk I/O resources. Yet, access to any one file system through the
    NFSv4 protocol requires that a single server be accessed. While NFSv4 allows file
    system migration, it does not provide a mechanism that supports multiple servers
    simultaneously exporting a single writable file system. This problem has become
    aggravated in recent years with the advent of very cheap and easily expanded clusters
    of application servers that are also NFS clients. The aggregate bandwidth demands
    of such clustered clients, typically working on a shared data set preferentially
    stored in a single file system, can increase much more quickly than the bandwidth
    of any server. The proposed solution is to provide for the parallelization of
    file services, by enhancing NFSv4 in a minor version.</p>"
