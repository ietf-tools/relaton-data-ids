abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 specification offers a dedicated
    message to update cryptographic keys during the lifetime of an ongoing session.
    The traffic secret and the initialization vector are updated directionally but
    the sender may trigger the recipient, via the request_update field, to transmit
    a key update message in the reverse direction. In environments where sessions
    are long-lived, such as industrial IoT or telecommunication networks, this key
    update alone is insufficient since forward secrecy is not offered via this mechanism.
    Earlier versions of TLS allowed the two peers to perform renegotiation, which
    is a handshake that establishes new cryptographic parameters for an existing session.
    When a security vulnerability with the renegotiation mechanism was discovered,
    RFC 5746 was developed as a fix. Renegotiation has, however, been removed from
    version 1.3 leaving a gap in the feature set of TLS. This specification defines
    an extended key update that supports forward secrecy.</p>"
