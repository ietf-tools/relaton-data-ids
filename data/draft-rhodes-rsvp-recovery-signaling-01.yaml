abstract:
- content: "<p>Implementation experience with RSVP-TE recovery signaling has uncovered
    some problems. Associations between LSPs in different sessions are forbidden.
    Protecting LSPs cannot themselves be protected. Overlapping repairs cause loss
    of traffic. This draft provides details of these problems for the community to
    consider.</p>"
