abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a modification to the validation procedure
    defined for the dissemination of BGP Flow Specifications. The dissemination of
    BGP Flow Specifications as specified in RFC 8955 requires that the originator
    of the Flow Specification match the originator of the best-match unicast route
    for the destination prefix embedded in the Flow Specification. For an Internal
    Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP) received route, the originator is typically a border
    router within the same autonomous system (AS). The objective is to allow only
    BGP speakers within the data forwarding path to originate BGP Flow Specifications.
    Sometimes it is desirable to originate the BGP Flow Specification from any place
    within the autonomous system itself, for example, from a centralized BGP route
    controller. However, the validation procedure described in RFC 8955 will fail
    in this scenario. The modification proposed herein relaxes the validation rule
    to enable Flow Specifications to be originated within the same autonomous system
    as the BGP speaker performing the validation. Additionally, this document revises
    the AS_PATH validation rules so Flow Specifications received from an External
    Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) peer can be validated when such a peer is a BGP
    route server. This document updates the validation procedure in RFC 8955.</p>"
