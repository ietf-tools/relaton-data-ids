abstract:
- content: "<p>Consider an IP multicast tree, constructed by Protocol Independent
    Multicast (PIM), that needs to pass through an MPLS domain in which Multipoint
    LDP (mLDP) point-to-multipoint and/or multipoint-to-multipoint Labels Switched
    Paths (LSPs) can be created. The part of the IP multicast tree that traverses
    the MPLS domain can be instantiated as a multipoint LSP. When a PIM Join message
    is received at the border of the MPLS domain, information from that message is
    encoded into mLDP messages. When the mLDP messages reach the border of the next
    IP domain, the encoded information is used to generate PIM messages that can be
    sent through the IP domain. The result is an IP multicast tree consisting of a
    set of IP multicast sub-trees that are spliced together with a multipoint LSP.
    This document describes procedures regarding how IP multicast trees are spliced
    together with multipoint LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
