abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures for IP multicast over a MPLS Traffic
    Engineered (TE) core. The defined procedures apply when the Provider Edge (PE)
    routers are running PIM-SM to exchange multicast routing information with the
    Customer Edge (CE) routers. Point to multipoint (P2MP) MPLS TE LSPs are used in
    the network core. The procedures described make use of the PIM-SM remote neighbor
    extensions described in [PIM-SM-REMOTE].</p>"
