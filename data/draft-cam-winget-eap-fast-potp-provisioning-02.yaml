abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-FAST is an extensible EAP method that enables the provisioning
    of credentials or other information by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel. As the tunnel may be unauthenticated,
    EAP-FAST further enables the use of inner EAP methods to establish mutual authentication
    prior to provisioning. This document describes how EAP-POTP may be used as the
    EAP-FAST inner method for credential provisioning.</p>"
