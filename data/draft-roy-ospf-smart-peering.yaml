abstract:
- content: "<p>There is significant overhead in OSPF when a router has to establish
    adjacencies with every peer with whom it can verify 2-way connectivity. OSPF supports
    the broadcast network type for these scenarios, where you only have to peer with
    the designated router (DR). However,a full mesh of connectivity is required for
    proper operation and this doesn't help in networks with overlapping partial meshes
    of connectivity. This draft proposes a technique to reduce the number of adjacencies
    based on shortest path tree (SPT) reachability information.</p>"
