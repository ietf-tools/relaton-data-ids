abstract:
- content: <p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides efficient asynchronous
    group key establishment for large groups with up to thousands of clients. In MLS,
    any member can commit a change to the group, and consequently, all members must
    download, validate, and maintain the full group state which can incur a significant
    communication and computational cost, especially when joining a group. This document
    defines Light MLS, an extension that allows for "light clients". A light client
    cannot commit changes to the group, and only has partial authentication information
    for the other members of the group, but is otherwise able to participate in the
    group. In exchange for these limitations, a light client can participate in an
    MLS group with significantly lower requirements in terms of download, memory,
    and processing.</p>
