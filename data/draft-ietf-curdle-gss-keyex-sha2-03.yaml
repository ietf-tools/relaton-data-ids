abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies additions and amendments to SSH GSS-API Methods
    [RFC4462]. It defines a new key exchange method that uses SHA-2 for integrity
    and deprecates weak DH groups. The purpose of this specification is to modernize
    the cryptographic primitives used by GSS Key Exchanges.</p>"
