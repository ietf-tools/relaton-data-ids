abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a secure and highly-efficient augmented password-authenticated
    key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy password
    and its verifier is registered in the intended server. In general, the user's
    password is chosen from a small set of dictionary, making the password susceptible
    to offline dictionary attacks. The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure against
    passive attacks, active attacks and offline dictionary attacks (on the obtained
    messages with passive/active attacks). Also, this protocol provides resistance
    to server compromise in the context that an attacker, who obtained the password
    verifier from the server, must at least perform offline dictionary attacks to
    gain any advantage in impersonating the user. The AugPAKE protocol is not only
    provably secure in the random oracle model but also the most efficient over the
    previous augmented PAKE protocols (SRP and AMP).</p>"
