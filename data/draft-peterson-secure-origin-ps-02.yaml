abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the past decade, SIP has become a major signaling protocol for
    voice communications, one which has replaced many traditional telephony deployments.
    However, interworking SIP with the traditional telephone network has ultimately
    reduced the security of Caller ID systems. Given the widespread interworking of
    SIP with the telephone network, the lack of effective standards for identifying
    the calling party in a SIP session has granted attackers new powers as they impersonate
    or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes,
    hacking voicemail boxes or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems
    trusted by banks. This document therefore examines the reasons why providing identity
    for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult, and shows how changes
    in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching a secure identity
    to SIP sessions.</p>"
