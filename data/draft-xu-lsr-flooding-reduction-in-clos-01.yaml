abstract:
- content: "<p>In a CLOS topology, an OSPF (or ISIS) router may receive identical
    copies of an LSA (or LSP) from multiple OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors. Moreover, two
    OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors may exchange the same LSA (or LSP) simultaneously. This
    results in unnecessary flooding of link- state information, which wastes the precious
    resources of OSPF (or ISIS) routers. Therefore, this document proposes extensions
    to OSPF (or ISIS) to reduce this flooding within CLOS networks. The reduction
    of OSPF (or ISIS) flooding is highly beneficial for improving the scalability
    of CLOS networks.</p>"
