abstract:
- content: "<p>Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reserved resources
    in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if the correspondent node does not support
    QoS, it would be useful to be able to reserve at least local resources at the
    access network, especially wireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile nodes
    the continuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signalling or slow re-reservations
    of resources after each handover. This draft proposes a simple enhancement to
    RSVP, so that initial resource reservations and re-reservations due to host mobility
    can be done locally in an access network.</p>"
