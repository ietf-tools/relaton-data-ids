abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model and reference architecture
    for a hierarchical topology of language models (LMs), where tiny, small, and large
    LMs cooperate to perform distributed inference, summarization, and decision-making.
    The model supports secure inter-node messaging, request escalation, token-based
    authorization, and decentralized validation using pluggable trust models. This
    architecture is designed for deployments where computational capabilities vary
    across nodes, such as edge-to-cloud environments or multi-tier AI systems. The
    goal is to provide a standards-based mechanism for orchestrating scalable, secure
    LM interactions across heterogeneous systems.</p>"
