abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a routing protocol
    designed for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). RPL includes routing information
    in IPv6 data plane datagrams to help maintain the routing topology. When forwarding
    a datagram into a RPL domain, a RPL router may need to expand the datagram to
    include routing information in IPv6 Extension headers. A generic solution has
    been defined that uses IP-in-IP tunneling to include RPL routing information.
    This document describes an alternative to inserting and removing RPL information
    in datagrams without the use of IP-in-IP tunneling.</p>"
