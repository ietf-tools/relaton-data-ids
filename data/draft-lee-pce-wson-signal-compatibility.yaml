abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides the Path Computation Element communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions for the support of signal compatibility constraints in Wavelength
    Switched Optical Networks (WSON). Signal compatibility is an essential path computation
    constraint in path computation of WSON networks where network elements can be
    limited to processing WSON signals with specific characteristics and attributes.</p>"
