abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of shapes for the representation of uncertainty
    for PIDF-LO geodetic location information. This includes a GML profile and a schema
    that defines additional geometries. Further recommendations are made to restrict
    the use of geographic Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and units of measure
    restrictions that improve interoperability.</p>"
