abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes IGAP, which allows user IP user clients and IP
    routers or network access servers to verify whether they can participate in a
    multicast group they hope and transport some information about it. IGAP is derived
    from IGMPv2, which can make users join a multicast group, who has the claim to
    participate a multicast group in a service. It's important for service providers
    to protect their revenue source.</p>"
