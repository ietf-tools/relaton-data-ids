abstract:
- content: "<p>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] requires a reliable transport
    for end-to-end communication. While historically TCP has been used for this purpose,
    this document proposes an alternative -- the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP) [RFC4960]. Similar to TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end transport
    connection to applications. Additionally, SCTP offers innovative services unavailable
    in TCP. This draft (i) specifies HTTP over SCTP's multistreaming service, (ii)
    lists open issues warranting more discussion and/or investigation, and (iii) shares
    some lessons learned from implementing HTTP over SCTP. Finally, this document
    highlights SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP.</p>"
