abstract:
- content: <p>The IPv6 interim mechanism 6to4 (RFC3056) uses automatic IPv6-over-IPv4
    tunneling to interconnect IPv6 networks. The architecture includes 6to4 routers
    and 6to4 relay routers, which accept and decapsulate IPv4 protocol-41 ("IPv6-in-IPv4")
    traffic from any node in the IPv4 internet. This characteristic enables a number
    of security threats, mainly Denial of Service. It also makes it easier for nodes
    to spoof IPv6 addresses. This document discusses these issues in more detail and
    suggests enhancements to alleviate the problems. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
