abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for making random selections in such
    a way that the unbiased nature of the choice is publicly verifiable. As an example,
    the selection of the voting members of the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom)
    from the pool of eligible volunteers is used. Similar techniques would be applicable
    to other cases. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
