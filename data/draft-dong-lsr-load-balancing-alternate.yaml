abstract:
- content: "<p>IGP normally computes the shortest paths in the network based on the
    IGP metric, without taking the link utilization into consideration. In network
    scenarios where there is link degradation or failure which causes link throughput
    reduction, or the volume of specific traffic flows increase dramatically, congestion
    can happen if only the best path is used for forwarding. This document describes
    IS-IS extensions for the computation of alternate traffic engineering paths which
    can be used for traffic load balancing when the shortest path is becoming congested.</p>"
