abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response,
    205 Alternate Answerer, that a SIP User Agent Server (UAS) can use to indicate
    to the User Agent Client (UAC) that the UAS is answering the request for which
    it was not the intended target. This is useful for cases where the UAC might wish
    to perform different actions based on such knowledge, such as terminate the dialog
    or re-attempt the request in a different way.</p>"
