abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides an update of RFC 2460[RFC2460] in order to improve
    the performance of IPv6 in an increasingly important use case, the use of tunneling
    to carry new transport protocols. The performance improvement is obtained by relaxing
    the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement for suitable tunneling protocol where header
    information is protected on the "inner" packet being carried. This relaxation
    removes the overhead associated with the computation of UDP checksums on tunneled
    IPv6 packets and thereby improves the efficiency of the traversal of firewalls
    and other network middleware by such new protocols. We describe how the IPv6 UDP
    checksum requirement can be relaxed in the situation where the encapsulated packet
    itself contains a checksum, the limitations and risks of this approach, and provides
    restrictions on the use of this relaxation to mitigate these risks.</p>
