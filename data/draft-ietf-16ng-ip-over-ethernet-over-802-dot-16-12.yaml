abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the transmission of IPv4 over Ethernet, as
    well as IPv6 over Ethernet, in an access network deploying the IEEE 802.16 cellular
    radio transmission technology. The Ethernet on top of IEEE 802.16 is realized
    by bridging connections that IEEE 802.16 provides between a base station and its
    associated subscriber stations. Due to the resource constraints of radio transmission
    systems and the limitations of the IEEE 802.16 Media Access Control (MAC) functionality
    for the realization of an Ethernet, the transmission of IP over Ethernet over
    IEEE 802.16 may considerably benefit by adding IP-specific support functions in
    the Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 while maintaining full compatibility with standard
    IP over Ethernet behavior. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
