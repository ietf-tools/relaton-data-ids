abstract:
- content: "<p>The authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by Internet
    application protocols is the transmission of clear-text passwords over a channel
    protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS). There are some significant security
    concerns with that mechanism, which could be addressed by the use of a challenge
    response authentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately, the HTTP Digest
    challenge response mechanism presently on the standards track failed widespread
    deployment, and have had success only in limited use. This specification describes
    a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response
    Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses security concerns with HTTP
    Digest and meets the deployability requirements. When used in combination with
    TLS or an equivalent security layer, a mechanism from this family could improve
    the status-quo for HTTP authentication.</p>"
