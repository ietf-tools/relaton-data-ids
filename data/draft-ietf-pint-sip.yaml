abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP can also be used to control calls established by other entities,
    for example, to have a computer control a PBX or a web server ask an SCP to initiate
    a call to a standard telephone (''click-to-dial- back''). We refer to the entity
    initiating the phone call as the controller and the PBX or SCP as the PSTN server.</p>"
