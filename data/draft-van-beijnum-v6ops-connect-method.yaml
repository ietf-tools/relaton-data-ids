abstract:
- content: "<p>As of the deprecation of NAT-PT as a mechanism to allow IPv6-only hosts
    to connect to IPv4-only hosts, there is no longer a viable way to provide interoperation
    between IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts connected to the internet. This document
    outlines a way to use the HTTP CONNECT method (better known as HTTPS proxying)
    to accomplish this interoperation for a large (but not the full) set of IP applications.
    The intent is to provide a base level usability for IPv6-only hosts to remove
    the need to provide IPv4 connectivity in all cases.</p>"
