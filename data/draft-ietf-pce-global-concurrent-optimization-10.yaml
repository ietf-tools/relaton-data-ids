abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) allows Path
    Computation Clients (PCCs) to request path computations from Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs), and lets the PCEs return responses. When computing or reoptimizing
    the routes of a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) through
    a network, it may be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in order to
    avoid blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-wide solutions. Such
    bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO). A GCO is able
    to simultaneously consider the entire topology of the network and the complete
    set of existing TE LSPs, and their respective constraints, and look to optimize
    or reoptimize the entire network to satisfy all constraints for all TE LSPs. A
    GCO may also be applied to some subset of the TE LSPs in a network. The GCO application
    is primarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution. This document provides
    application-specific requirements and the PCEP extensions in support of GCO applications.
