abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies mechanisms for backward compatibility of Ethernet
    VPN Virtual Private Wire Service (EVPN-VPWS) solutions with legacy Virtual Private
    Wire Service (VPWS). It provides mechanisms for seamless integration in the same
    MPLS/IP network on a per- pseudowire or per-flexible-crossconnect basis. Implementation
    of this document enables service providers to introduce EVPN-VPWS PEs in their
    brown-field deployments of leagcy VPWS networks. This document specifies control-plane
    and forwarding behavior needed for auto- discovery of a pseudowire in order to
    enable seamless integration between EVPN-VPWS and VPWS PEs.</p>"
