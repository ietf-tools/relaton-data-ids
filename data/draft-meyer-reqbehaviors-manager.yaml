abstract:
- content: "<p>The behavior of mail lists on the Internet has become much more sophisticated
    than the alias expanders discussed in the standards for Internet messages formats.
    The lack of standard behavior for this part of the Internet messaging system creates
    confusion among users, resulting in misdirected or inappropriately duplicated
    messages. This document lists required behaviors for mail list managers derived
    from [RFC2821] and [RFC2822] in hopes of reducing the confusion, misdirected and
    duplicated mail, while at the same time simplifying the configuration process
    for mail list managers.</p>"
