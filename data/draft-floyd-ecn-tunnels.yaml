abstract:
- content: "<p>The encapsulation of IP packet headers in tunnels is used in many places,
    including IPsec and IP in IP [RFC2003]. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
    is an experimental addition to the IP architecture that uses the ECN field in
    the IP header to provide an indication of the onset of congestion to applications.
    ECN provides this congestion indication to enable end-node adaptation to network
    conditions without the use of dropped packets [RFC 2481]. Currently, the ECN specification
    does not accommodate the constraints imposed by with some of these pre-existing
    specifications for tunnels. This document considers issues related to interactions
    between ECN and IP tunnels, and proposes two alternative solutions.</p>"
