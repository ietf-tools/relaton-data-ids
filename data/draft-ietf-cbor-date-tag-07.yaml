abstract:
- content: '<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC
    7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely
    small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need
    for version negotiation. In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition
    of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (date/time string
    as per RFC 3339) and tag 1 (POSIX "seconds since the epoch"). Since then, additional
    requirements have become known. This specification defines a CBOR tag for a date
    text string (as per RFC 3339) for applications needing a textual date representation
    within the Gregorian calendar without a time. It also defines a CBOR tag for days
    since the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a
    numeric date representation without a time. This specification is the reference
    document for IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.</p>'
