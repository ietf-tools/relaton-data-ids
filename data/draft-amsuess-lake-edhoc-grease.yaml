abstract:
- content: "<p>This document applies the extensibility mechanism GREASE (Generate
    Random Extensions And Sustain Extensibility), which was pioneered for TLS, to
    the EDHOC ecosystem. It reserves a set of non-critical EAD labels and unusable
    cipher suites that may be included in messages to ensure peers correctly handle
    unknown values.</p>"
