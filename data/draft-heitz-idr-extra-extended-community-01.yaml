abstract:
- content: "<p>Auto-derived identifiers are used by applications to enable zero configuration
    features. Such identifiers are often a combination of primitive identifiers and
    are thus longer. In addition, existing identifiers have grown longer. IP addresses
    have grown from 4 octets to 16. AS numbers have grown from 2 octets to 4. In order
    to accommodate such longer identifiers in BGP extended communities, this document
    defines a new BGP path attribute, the Extra Extended Communities attribute. It
    is similar to the Extended Community, but is 24 octets long. Communities are mostly
    used within ASes under a single administration or between neighboring ASes. Limiting
    the spread of communities beyond their intended reach and polluting the internet
    at large is complex and error prone. To simplify this, enhanced transitivity options
    are provided.</p>"
