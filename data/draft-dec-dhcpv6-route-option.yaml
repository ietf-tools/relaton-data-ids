abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes DHCPv6 Route Options for provisioning IPv6
    routes on nodes with DHCPv6 clients. This is expected to improve the ability of
    an operator to configure and influence a node's ability to pick an appropriate
    route to a destination when this node is multi- homed and where other means of
    route configuration may be impractical.</p>"
