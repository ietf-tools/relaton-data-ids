abstract:
- content: "<p>Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies are characterized
    by very low physical layer bit and message transmission rates. Moreover, a response
    to a message sent by an LPWAN device may often only be received after a significant
    delay. As a result, Round-Trip Time (RTT) values in LPWAN are often (sometimes,
    significantly) greater than typical default values of Retransmission TimeOut (RTO)
    algorithms. Furthermore, buffering at network elements such as radio gateways
    may interact negatively with LPWAN technology transmission mechanisms, potentially
    exacerbating RTTs by up to several orders of magnitude. This document provides
    guidance for RTO settings in LPWAN, and describes an experimental dual RTO algorithm
    for LPWAN.</p>"
