abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a pragmatic set of configuration recommendations
    for MANETs, as well as provides a rationale for why these recommendations are
    sound. While there may be other equally valid ways of configuring a MANET, the
    recommendations in this document have the merit of being supported by an existence
    proof (there're running networks in existence, configured according to these recommendations),
    and they require neither modifications to the IP stack nor to upper-layer protocols
    or applications.</p>"
