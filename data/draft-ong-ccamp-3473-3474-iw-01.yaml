abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines interworking procedures between [RFC 3473] (Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE) and [RFC 3474] (GMPLS RSVP-TE Usage and Extensions for ASON)
    signaling. RFC 3474 extensions are used in ITU-T Recommendation [G.7713.2]. Two
    basic interworking scenarios are discussed. RFC 3474 was intended to use the same
    basic mechanisms as and to be backwards compatible to RFC 3473. Some objects in
    3474 are carried transparently over an RFC 3473 network, in accordance with RSVP
    procedures for unrecognized objects. Other objects must be mapped or generated
    at the interworking point. The mechanisms described in this document are applicable
    to any types of interfaces common to RFC 3473 and Recommendation G.7713.2, esp.
    time-division multiplexed, lambda or fiber switching interfaces.</p>"
