abstract:
- content: <p>Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and preferences
    regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. When establishing interactive
    communication "calls" there needs to be a way to communicate and ideally match
    (i.e., negotiate) the caller's language needs, abilities, and preferences with
    the capabilities of the called party. This is especially important with emergency
    calling, where a call can be routed to a PSAP or call taker capable of communicating
    with the user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call
    during setup, but this applies to non- emergency calls as well (as an example,
    when calling an airline reservation desk). This document describes the need and
    expected use, and discusses the solution using either an existing or new SDP attribute.</p>
