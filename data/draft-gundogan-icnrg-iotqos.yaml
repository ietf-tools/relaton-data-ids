abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes manageable resources in ICN IoT deployments
    and a lightweight traffic classification method for mapping priorities to resources.
    Management methods are further derived for controlling latency and reliability
    of traffic flows in constrained environments. This work includes a distributed
    management of the heterogeneous resources (i) forwarding capacities, (ii) Pending
    Interest Table (PIT) space, and (iii) in-network data storage. By correlating
    these common ICN resources, performance measures can be optimized without sacrificing
    concurrent traffic demands. Different from the IP world, QoS in ICN can be benifical
    for all participants and manage 'quality instead of unfairness'.</p>"
