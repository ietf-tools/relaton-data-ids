abstract:
- content: "<p>With increasing use of DLT (distributed ledger technology) systems,
    including blockchain systems and networks, for virtual assets, there is a need
    for asset-related data and metadata to traverse system boundaries and link their
    respective business workflows. Core requirements for such interoperation between
    systems are the abilities of these systems to project views of their assets to
    external parties, either individual agents or other systems, and the abilities
    of those external parties to locate and address the views they are interested
    in. A view denotes the complete or partial state of a virtual asset, or the output
    of a function computed over the states of one or more assets, or locks or pledges
    made over assets for internal or external parties. Systems projecting these views
    must be able to guard them using custom access control policies, and external
    parties consuming them must be able to verify them independently for authenticity,
    finality, and freshness. The end-to-end protocol that allows an external party
    to request a view by an address and a DLT system to return a view in response
    must be DLT-neutral and mask the interior particularities and complexities of
    the DLT systems. The view generation and verification modules at the endpoints
    must obey the native consensus logic of their respective systems.</p>"
