abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".
    Segment Routing architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well
    as an IPv6 data plane. This draft describes the OSPFv3 extensions required to
    support Segment Routing over an IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>
