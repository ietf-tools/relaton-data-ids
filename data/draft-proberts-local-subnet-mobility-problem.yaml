abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a problem statement for investigation within
    the IRTF. There are a couple of seemingly unrelated problems that have led investigators
    to converge on the desirability of implementing a routing protocol whose purpose
    is to allow a mobile node to retain connectivity via its current IP subnet while
    it moves within the scope of the micro mobility domain.</p>"
