abstract:
- content: "<p>New RR types have been proposed that appear only at the parent side
    of a delegation, similar to the DS resource record (RR) type. Supporting parent
    side RR types requires modifications to the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
    Without these modifications, validating resolvers are susceptible to response
    modification attacks. An on-path adversary could potentially remove the parent-side
    resource records without being detected. To detect the removal of a parent-side
    RR type, an authenticated denial record (such as NSEC or NSEC3) is necessary to
    confirm presence or absence of a parent-side RR type. Currently, validating resolver
    do not expect authenticated denial records in a secure delegation response. Therefore,
    a secure signal is needed to inform the validating resolver to anticipate authenticated
    denial records for a delegation. To support the future deployment of parent-side
    RR types, this draft designates a range of yet unallocated RR types specifically
    for parent-side use. Authoritative servers will include these records in a delegation
    response without requiring upgrades.</p>"
