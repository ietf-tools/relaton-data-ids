abstract:
- content: "<p>The compression of domain names in DNS messages was introduced in [RFC1035].
    Although some remarks were made about applicability to future defined resource
    record types, no method has been deployed yet to support interoperable DNS compression
    for RR types specified since then. This document summarizes current problems and
    proposes a new compression scheme to be applied to future RR types, which supports
    interoperability. Also, suggestions are made how to deal with RR types defined
    so far.</p>"
