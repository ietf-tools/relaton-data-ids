abstract:
- content: "<p>SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture for P2MP
    service delivery. A P2MP policy consists of candidate paths that connects the
    Root of the Tree to a set of Leaves. The P2MP policy is composed of replication
    segments. A replication segment is a forwarding instruction for a candidate path
    which is downloaded to the Root, transit nodes and the leaves. This document specifies
    a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order to advertise P2MP policy from a controller
    to a set of nodes. This document introduces two new route types within this NLRI,
    one for P2MP policy and its candidate paths that need to be programmed on the
    Root node and another for the replication segment and forwarding instructions
    that needs to be programmed on the Root, and optionally on Transit and Leaf nodes.
    It should be noted that this document does not specify how the Root and the Leaves
    are discovered on the controller, it only describes how the P2MP Policy and Replication
    Segments are programmed from the controller to the nodes.</p>"
