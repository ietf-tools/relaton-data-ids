abstract:
- content: "<p>Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol aims to enable mutual
    authentication between networks and a phone equipped with a Universal Subscriber
    Identity Module(USIM) card. 5G AKA introduces Subscription Permanent Identifier
    (SUPI) and Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) to preserve user
    identity privacy. However, when the authentication server becomes an unsecure
    entity due to malwares or malicious attacks, these existing schemes cannot effectively
    protect user identity privacy at the server-end. For a small number of important
    users with high demand for identity privacy and security, comprehensive identity
    privacy protection is one of their important security requirements. Based on a
    security assumption that the server is trustworthy within a limited time, this
    document proposes a privacy-enhanced access authentication scheme (PEAA) which
    is compatible with 5G AKA. This scheme not only achieves user anonymity on wireless
    channels by dynamic temporary pseudonyms, but also ensures that the server authenticates
    users without their permanent identities. In the context of hierarchical security
    requirements, PEAA scheme and the existing 5G AKA can respectively provide different
    user identity privacy protection services for users with different security requirements.</p>"
