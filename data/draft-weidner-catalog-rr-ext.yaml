abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes an extension to the Certification Authority Authorization
    (CAA) DNS Resource Record (RR) that enables the mandatory or optional binding
    of Certificate Transparency (CT) Log URIs directly within DNS. By embedding CT-Log
    endpoints in CAA RR, Certification Authorities (CAs) gain a standardized, discoverable
    mechanism for retrieving preferred and permitted CT-Log endpoint information,
    thereby enhancing the security and auditability of X.509 TLS certificate issuance.
    The extension defines the syntax and semantics for a new CAA property tag, *"issuect"*,
    and introduces a parameter set consisting of _"desc"_, _"critical"_, _"validfrom"_,
    _"validtill"_, _"cturi"_, _"logid"_, and _"pubkey"_. It outlines validation and
    processing rules, discusses deployment considerations, privacy implications, and
    interoperability with existing DNS, CA, and CT infrastructures. Additionally,
    the draft proposes an MTA-STS-like hardening mechanism, called *CAA-CT-STS*, for
    the new property to further strengthen the PKI ecosystem. Finally, it introduces
    the recursive acronym CATALOG (CATALOG Authorization Transparency And Log Overlay
    for Graph-based DNS) as a mnemonic for the overall extension framework.</p>
