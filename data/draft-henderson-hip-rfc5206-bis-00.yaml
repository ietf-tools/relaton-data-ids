abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines mobility and multihoming extensions to the Host
    Identity Protocol (HIP). Specifically, this document defines a general "LOCATOR"
    parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate
    addresses at which it may be reached. This document also defines elements of procedure
    for mobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes
    the primary locator that it uses to receive packets. While the same LOCATOR parameter
    can also be used to support end-host multihoming, detailed procedures are left
    for further study. Status of This Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF
    in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79. Internet-Drafts
