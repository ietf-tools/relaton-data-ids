abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirements for routing architectures described in this document
    were produced by two sub-groups under the IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) in
    2001, with some editorial updates up to 2006. The two sub- groups worked independently,
    and the resulting requirements represent two separate views of the problem and
    of what is required to fix the problem. This document may usefully serve as part
    of the recommended reading for anyone who works on routing architecture designs
    for the Internet in the future. The document is published with the support of
    the IRTF RRG as a record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding
    that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding
    or the technical consensus of the research group at the date of publication. This
    document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.</p>"
