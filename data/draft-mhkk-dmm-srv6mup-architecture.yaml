abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Mobile User Plane (MUP) architecture using
    Segment Routing (SR) for Distributed Mobility Management. The requirements for
    Distributed Mobility Management described in [RFC7333] can be satisfied by routing
    fashion. Mobile services are deployed over several parts of IP networks. An SR
    network can accommodate a part of those networks, or all those networks. IPv6
    dataplane option (SRv6) is suitable for both cases especially for the latter case
    thanks to the large address space, so this document illustrates the MUP deployment
    cases with IPv6 dataplane. MUP Architecture can incorporate existing session based
    mobile networks. By leveraging Segment Routing, mobile user plane can be integrated
    into the dataplane. In that routing paradigm, session information between the
    entities of the mobile user plane is turned to routing information.</p>"
