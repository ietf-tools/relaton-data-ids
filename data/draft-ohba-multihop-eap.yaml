abstract:
- content: "<p>All EAP lower layers that have been defined for network access authentication
    have the requirement that an EAP peer and an EAP authenticator are in the same
    IP subnet. This draft describes some scenarios where relaxing this requirement
    so that the EAP peer and the EAP authenticator are multiple IP hops away from
    each other could be useful or necessary. The draft also extracts a set of requirements
    for the design of such a multi-hop EAP lower layer based on the scenarios.</p>"
