abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides an analysis of the aspects of multi-homing support
    for the IPv6 protocol suite. The purpose of this analysis is to provide a taxonomy
    for classification of various proposed approaches to multi-homing. It is also
    an objective of this exercise to identify common aspects of this domain of study,
    and also to provide a framework that can allow exploration of some of the further
    implications of various architectural extensions that are intended to support
    multi-homing.</p>"
