abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to provide Internet connectivity to mobile
    ad hoc networks. It describes a mechanism whereby the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance
    Vector (AODV) Routing protocol can cooperate with the Mobile IP protocol such
    that mobile nodes within an ad hoc network, which are out of direct transmission
    range of a foreign agent, can obtain a care-of address and register with the foreign
    agent to obtain Internet connectivity. Mobile IP is used for mobile node registrations
    with a foreign agent, while AODV is used for routing within the ad hoc network
    and for obtaining routes to the foreign agent. Once a manet node has a care-of
    address, it may send data packets to destinations in the Internet by routing through
    the foreign agent.</p>"
