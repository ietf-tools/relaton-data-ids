abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to identify the requirements for a protocol
    framework to provide SIP user and device profiles to SIP user agents. The objective
    is not to invent new special purpose protocols, but to identify the requirements
    such that a rational decision can be made as to what existing protocol(s) should
    be used to solve the problem of providing user and device profiles to SIP user
    agents. This document also contains an evaluation of a set of applicable protocols.</p>"
