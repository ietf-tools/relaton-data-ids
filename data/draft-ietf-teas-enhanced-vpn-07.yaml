abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private
    Network (VPN+) services. The purpose of enhanced VPNs is to support the needs
    of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services,
    by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and Traffic Engineering
    (TE) technologies and adds characteristics that specific services require over
    and above traditional VPNs. Typically, VPN+ will be used to underpin network slicing,
    but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services
    between customer sites. It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered using
    a combination of existing, modified, and new networking technologies. This document
    provides an overview of relevant technologies and identifies some areas for potential
    new work. Compared to traditional VPNs, it is not envisaged that large numbers
    of VPN+ services will be deployed in a network. In other word, it is not intended
    that all existing VPNs supported by a network will use VPN+ techniques.</p>"
