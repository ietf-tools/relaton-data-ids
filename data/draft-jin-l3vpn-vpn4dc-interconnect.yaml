abstract:
- content: "<p>VPN4DC provides VPN oriented datacenter service to customer through
    L3VPN which is consisted of (private) L3VPN in datacenter and network provider's
    L3VPN over wide geographical area. If we considering the two L3VPN in two different
    AS, [RFC4364] providers three options to achieve L3VPN inter-AS connection. Both
    option A and B could be used to connect L3VPN in VPN4DC. This draft discusses
    a novel method for implementing option A, to automatically configure the VRF interface
    in order to interconnect the two segments of the end-to-end L3VPN. This L3VPN
    interconnection automation mechanism is expected to significantly reduce the VPN
    oriented inter-connection/service provisioning time.</p>"
