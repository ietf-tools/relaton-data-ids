    in this memo that permits a Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent

    on requirements identified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calendaring
    and Scheduling (CALSCH) Working Group. More information about the IETF CALSCH
    Working Group activities can be found on the IMC web site at http:// www.imc.org/ietf-calendar
    and at the IETF web site at http:// www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html
