abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications across
    many media types, including real-time audio, video, text, instant messaging, and
    presence. In its current form, it allows session invitations, instant messages,
    and other requests to be delivered from one party to another without requiring
    explicit consent of the recipient. Without such consent, it is possible for SIP
    to be used for malicious purposes, including spam and denial-of-service attacks.
    This document identifies a set of requirements for extensions to SIP that add
    consent-based communications. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
