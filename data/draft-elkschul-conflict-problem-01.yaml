abstract:
- content: "<p>At the IETF, we currently use a set of methods to communicate a point
    of view, to solicit input, to resolve conflict and attempt to obtain consensus
    within the group. These methods include: writing an Internet Draft, discussion
    on email lists, discussion at face-to- face, interim or virtual meetings, and
    design teams. At times, these methods fall short. People become entrenched in
    their positions. A Working Group may be split for a prolonged period wasting time
    and energy. There may be a lasting impact. While the authors support rough consensus,
    the collateral damage of this process, at times can be considerable. This document
    discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each of the current methods of communication
    focusing solely on their efficacy at conflict resolution. A companion document
    will propose some solutions including alternative methods of conflict resolution.</p>"
