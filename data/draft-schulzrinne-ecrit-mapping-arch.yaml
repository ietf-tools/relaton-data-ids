abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for a global, scalable, resilient
    and administratively distributed system for mapping geographic location information
    to URLs. The architecture generalizes well-known approaches found in hierarchical
    lookup systems such as DNS. The architecture does not depend on using a specific
    protocol, but does require that protocols can summarize the coverage region of
    a node.</p>"
