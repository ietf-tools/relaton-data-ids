abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the "environment" and "ihave" extensions to
    the Sieve email filtering language. The "environment" extension gives Sieve access
    to information about the environment where the Sieve interpreter is running. The
    "ihave" extension provides a means to write scripts that can take advantage of
    optional Sieve features but can still run when those optional features are not
    available.</p>
