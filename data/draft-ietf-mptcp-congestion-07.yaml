abstract:
- content: <p>Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communications
    are usually restricted to a single path per connection. Resource usage within
    the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths
    to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport
    in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols
    such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the
    multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms
    such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow
    more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its
    subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available
    will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a
    property called "resource pooling" where a bundle of links effectively behaves
    like one shared link with bigger capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency
    of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion
    control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms running on different
    subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall
    aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that
    is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links.
    This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
