abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP-Payments describes a mechanism for passing a standardized payment
    request in the headers of an HTTP 402 response and the expected behaviour of HTTP
    clients that receive such a response. Feedback This specification is an early
    experiment in bringing the work of the W3C Web Payments working group to the HTTP
    protocol. It is maintained at https://github.com/adrianhopebailie/http-payments
    [1]. The work is inspired by work in the Interledger community on [HTTP-ILP]</p>"
