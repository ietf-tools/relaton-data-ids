abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for interconnecting, or peering,
    the distribution systems of Content Networks (CN). Distribution internetworking
    requires advertising the capabilities of a CN offering distribution services,
    moving content from one CN to another, and signaling requirements for consistent
    storage and delivery of content. This document does not address requirements for
    directing user agents to distributed content, nor for aggregating access information
    for distributed content.</p>"
