abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents provides a proposed definition for a supplemental package
    to Megaco/H.248. The proposed package addresses support of functionality to enable
    a MGC to store information on a MG which can subsequently be retrieved via audit.
    The specific purpose for storing / retrieving data in this way is regarded as
    being solely the concern of the MGC. This draft merely proposes the means for
    supporting such capability.</p>"
