abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the transmission of IP datagrams
    over DVB-S2, the second generation standard for Digital Video Broadcasting over
    Satellite. The new standard features an improved and adaptive physical layer,
    as well as a new framing structure at link level, the Generic Streams. Combined
    use of adaptability and Generic Streams is expected to offer throughputs never
    achieved for IP services up to now, but no standard way to carry IP data using
    the specific features of DVB-S2 has been published up to date. The present document
    analyzes these issues, and it identifies the requirements for the definition of
    a standard interface between the DVB-S2 link layer and an IP subnetwork.</p>"
