abstract:
- content: "<p>This document standardizes the means of requesting a sampled capture
    stream from a router, receiving details about the resulting data flow, and the
    structure of the data flow itself. This is specifically tailored to having various
    hardware ASICs be able to perform this operation as quickly as possible, by allowing
    communication of the specific bit formats of headers applied to the packet flow,
    in a way that enhances interoperability between sources and sinks. Historically,
    NetFlow and its ilk have been used for these use cases, however the growth in
    hardware forward speeds is far outpacing the growth in CPU speeds, and the CPU-heavy
    parts of NetFlow is resulting in a reduction of sampling rates that include all
    of the fields provided by NetFlow that require CPU lookups.</p>"
