abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of
    candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is realized by a client-server
    protocol. This document establishes a well-known IP address for the ALTO service
    and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in the resource consumer can use it to
    access the ALTO service. Terminology and Requirements Language This document makes
    use of the ALTO terminology defined in RFC 5693 [RFC5693].</p>"
