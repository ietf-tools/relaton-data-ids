abstract:
- content: "<p>The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework (DCAF) defines how constrained
    devices can securely obtain security associations and authorization information
    from their respective less constrained devices, the Authorization Managers. In
    DCAF a constrained client requests an authorization ticket from the Server Authorization
    Manager (SAM) by contacting its own Client Authorization Manager (CAM). However,
    there may be cases where this approach is not applicable, e.g., because the client
    is not able to reach Authorization Managers in the Internet. Specifically for
    these situations, this document defines the Server- Initiated Ticket Request (SITR)
    that specifies how a constrained server can request authorization tokens and securely
    obtain security associations and authorization information for mutual authenticated
    authorization with the client.</p>"
