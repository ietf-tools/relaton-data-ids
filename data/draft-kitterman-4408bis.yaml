abstract:
- content: "<p>E-mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways. In particular,
    existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the
    reverse-path of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.
    This document describes version 1 of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol,
    whereby a domain may explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its
    domain name, and a receiving host may check such authorization.</p>"
