abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes the Simple Network Time Protocol Version
    4 (SNTPv4), which is a subset of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) used to synchronize
    computer clocks in the Internet. SNTPv4 can be used when the ultimate performance
    of a full NTP implementation based on RFC 1305 is neither needed nor justified.
    When operating with current and previous NTP and SNTP versions, SNTPv4 requires
    no changes to the specifications or known implementations, but rather clarifies
    certain design features that allow operation in a simple, stateless remote-procedure
    call (RPC) mode with accuracy and reliability expectations similar to the UDP/TIME
    protocol described in RFC 868. This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1769, which describes
    SNTP Version 3 (SNTPv3), and RFC 2030, which describes SNTPv4. Its purpose is
    to correct certain inconsistencies in the previous documents and to clarify header
    formats and protocol operations for NTPv3 (IPv4) and SNTPv4 (IPv4, IPv6, and OSI),
    which are also used for SNTP. A further purpose is to provide guidance for home
    and business client implementations for routers and other consumer devices to
    protect the server population from abuse. A working knowledge of the NTPv3 specification,
    RFC 1305, is not required for an implementation of SNTP. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
