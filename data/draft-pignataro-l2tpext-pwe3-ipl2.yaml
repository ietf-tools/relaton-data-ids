abstract:
- content: "<p>The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3, (L2TPv3) defines a protocol
    for tunneling a variety of data link protocols over IP networks. These data link
    protocols must be of the same technology and the L2TPv3 session carries frames
    of that technology. However, if it is known beforehand that the frames to be transported
    only carry IP datagrams as payload, it is possible to provide L2TPv3 sessions
    that connects unlike data link technologies (e.g., ethernet and PPP). This is
    achieved by terminating the Layer 2 protocol in the LCCE and transporting only
    the IP datagrams over L2TPv3, such that the L2TPv3 session links uniform Pseudowire
    terminations (i.e. IP Layer 2 Transport Pseudowire Type) and an NSP function provides
    interworking. This document describes the control messaging and encapsulation
    specifics of how to tunnel IP datagrams directly over L2TPv3 to allow for connecting
    different data link technologies in an interworking fashion.</p>"
