- content: "<p>This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice gateway
    that is a function or function group for handling data plane traffic, such as
    connecting/disconnecting and compose/decompose network slice subnet instances
    and providing network slices from end to end. The interworking between management
    and control elements at the management and control planes with the gateway function
    for controlling and orchestrating end-to-end network slices are also presented
    in this document.</p>"
