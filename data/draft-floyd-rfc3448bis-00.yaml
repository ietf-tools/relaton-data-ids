abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). TFRC is a
    congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best- effort Internet
    environment. It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows,
    but has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making
    it more suitable for applications such as telephony or streaming media where a
    relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.</p>"
