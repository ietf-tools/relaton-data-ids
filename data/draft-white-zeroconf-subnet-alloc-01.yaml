abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability of a multiple segment network to zero configure has advantages.
    This is especially the case when the network designer/builder has few IP networking
    skills, as can be expected in the home environment. This document describes a
    method for the zero- configuration of unique subnet prefixes in a network. The
    method proposed is based on the existence of the Unique Identifier Allocation
    Protocol (UIAP) but can be modified to use another protocol providing the same
    service.</p>"
