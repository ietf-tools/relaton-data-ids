abstract:
- content: "<p>Fast congestion control is discussed in academic papers as well as
    in the different standard bodies. There is no one proposal for providing a solution
    that will work for all use cases leading to multiple approaches. By congestion
    control we refer to an end to end solution and not only to the congestion control
    algorithm on the sender side. This document describes the current state of flow
    control and congestion for Data Centers and proposes future directions.</p>"
