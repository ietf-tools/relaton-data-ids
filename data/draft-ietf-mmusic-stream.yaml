abstract:
- content: "<p>This strawman proposal presents a revised version of the RTSP proposal
    put forward to the MMUSIC group, borrowing liberally from the original. The Real
    Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level protocol for control
    over the delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP provides an extensible
    framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real- time data, such as
    audio and video. Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored clips.
    This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery sessions, provide
    a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP and TCP, and
    delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 1889).</p>"
