abstract:
- content: "<p>Dissemination of the Traffic flow information was first introduced
    in the BGP protocol [RFC5575]. FlowSpec routes are used to distribute traffic
    filtering rules used to filter Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. For networks that
    only deploy an IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) (e.g., OSPF), it is required that
    the IGP is extended to distribute Flow Specification or FlowSpec routes. This
    document discusses use cases for distributing flow specification (FlowSpec) routes
    using OSPF. Furthermore, this document defines a OSPF FlowSpec Opaque Link State
    Advertisement (LSA) encoding format that can be used to distribute FlowSpec routes,
    its validation procedures for imposing the filtering information on the routers,
    and a capability to indicate the support of FlowSpec functionality.</p>"
