abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed
    to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such
    information to applications that need to choose one or more endpoints to connect
    to among large sets of logically equivalent ones. The base protocol specification
    adopts a simple pull-based model, according to which the client retrieves the
    information encoded as JSON objects over HTTP directly from the server. This document
    proposes (for discussion) a mechanism for providing server-initiated information
    update notifications through a WebSocket-based ALTO protocol extension that easily
    integrates in the basic protocol model.</p>"
