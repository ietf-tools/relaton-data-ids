abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
    for rapid network prefix and service discovery in vehicular networks. It is assumed
    that a vehicle or a Road-Side Unit (RSU) have an external network interface and
    their internal network. This document defines new ND options to allows a vehicle
    to announce the network prefixes and services inside its internal network to another
    vehicle or RSU.</p>"
