abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enables a pair of communicating proxies to reuse a congestion-controlled
    connection between themselves for sending requests in the forwards and backwards
    direction. Because the connection is essentially aliased for requests going in
    the backwards direction, reuse is predicated upon both the communicating endpoints
    authenticating themselves using X.509 certificates through Transport Layer Security
    (TLS). For this reason, we only consider connection reuse for TLS over TCP and
    TLS over Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). This document also provides
    guidelines on connection reuse and virtual SIP servers and the interaction of
    connection reuse and DNS SRV lookups in SIP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
