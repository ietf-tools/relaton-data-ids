abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a generic bundle mechanism for the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) by which the media described by a number of media descriptions
    ("m= lines") are multiplexed and transmitted over a single transport association.
    The single transport association is described by an additional media description,
    allowing SDP attributes to be applied to the aggregate, independently of attributes
    applied to the constituents. In offer/answer usage, the bundle mechanism is backward
    compatible with SDP processors that do not understand the mechanism. The mechanism
    is designed to be compatible with the limitations of the existing Internet infrastructure.</p>
