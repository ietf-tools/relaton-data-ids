abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of the Pan-European in-vehicle emergency call service
    defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally referred
    to as "eCall"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special form
    of emergency calls placed by vehicles, providing real-time communications and
    an integrated set of related data. This document also registers MIME media types
    and an Emergency Call Data Type for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control
    data, and an INFO package to enable carrying this data in SIP INFO requests. Although
    this specification is designed to meet the requirements of next-generation Pan-European
    eCall (NG-eCall), it is specified generically such that the technology can be
    reused or extended to suit requirements across jurisdictions.</p>
