abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to explain the requirement and usecases for reducing
    reliability gaps in first point of contact during secure authentication of nodes
    without the need of any CA. It focuses on use of network layer security approaches
    for this purpose. Privacy requirement is also one of the important topic that
    will be addressed in this draft. It also discusses the requirements and use cases
    for having a common language (protocols) for authentication/authorization in visualization
    environments where Software Defined Network (SDN) or Network Function Visualization
    (NFV) approaches are in use.</p>"
