abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL protocol provides layer 2 multicast data forwarding using IS-IS
    link state routing. Distribution trees are computed based on the link state information
    through Shortest Path First calculation. When a link on the distribution tree
    fails, a campus-wide recovergence of this distribution tree will take place, which
    can be time consuming and may cause considerable disruption to the ongoing multicast
    service. This document proposes to build the backup distribution tree to protect
    links on the primary distribution tree. Since the backup distribution tree is
    built up ahead of the link failure, when a link on the primary distribution tree
    fails, the pre-installed backup forwarding table will be utilized to deliver multicast
    packets without waiting for the campus-wide recovergence, which minimizes the
    service disruption.</p>"
