abstract:
- content: "<p>Certain L2VPN architectures [IPLS, VPLS] rely on there being a full
    mesh of pseudowires [PWE3-ARCH] among a set of entities. This mesh is used to
    provide a 'LAN-like' service among the entities. If one or more of these pseudowires
    is absent, so that there is not really a full mesh, various higher layers (from
    routing to bridge control protocols) that expect a LAN-like service may fail to
    work as expected. Therefore it is desirable to have procedures that enable the
    pseudowire endpoints to determine automatically whether there is really a full
    mesh or not. It is also desirable to have procedures that cause the L2VPNs to
    adapt to pseudowire failures. This document proposes a set of procedures to meet
    these goals. Detailed protocol encodings are not present, but will be added in
    future versions.</p>"
