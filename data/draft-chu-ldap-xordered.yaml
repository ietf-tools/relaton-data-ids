abstract:
- content: "<p>As LDAP is used more extensively for managing various kinds of data,
    one often encounters a need to preserve both the ordering and the content of data,
    despite the inherently unordered structure of entries and attribute values in
    the directory. This document describes a scheme to attach ordering information
    to attributes in a directory so that the ordering may be preserved and propagated
    to other LDAP applications.</p>"
