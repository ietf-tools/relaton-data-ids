abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the requirements that the MGCP, MEGACO, and
    SIP VoIP Signaling Protocols must satisfy in order to meet the needs for VoIP
    deployment in carrier class and large geographically distributed organization
    networks. These requirements were developed with a specific focus on network address
    translation (NAT), network through application layer packet filtering, signaling
    across multiple trust domains, and redundancy of call/controllers, media gateways,
    proxies and registrars.</p>"
