abstract:
- content: "<p>ROUTING ARCHITECT'S WARNING: flagrant IPv4 site multihoming practices
    cause a significant increase the routing table size, change rates and instability,
    the tragedy of the commons by encouraging selfish routing practices, the exhaustion
    of the 16-bit AS number space, and may collapse the Internet interdomain routing
    architecture. As there has been a desire to avoid similar problems as seen with
    IPv4, the use of similar techniques to achieve site multihoming has been prevented
    operationally in IPv6. However, the long effort to proceed with other IPv6 multihoming
    mechanisms has produced lots of heat but little light. This memo tries to list
    available techniques, split the organizations to different types to separately
    examine their multihoming needs, to look at the immediate and short-term solutions
    for these organization types, and to list a few immediate action items on how
    to proceed with IPv6 site multihoming.</p>"
