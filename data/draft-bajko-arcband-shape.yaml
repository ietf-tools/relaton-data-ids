abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a binary encoding format for an arcband, which
    is compatible with the binary encoding defined by 3GPP [3GPP23.032], and which
    is widely used in today's cellular networks. This encoding can additionally be
    used by a number of other protocols, which demand a bandwidth efficient encoding
    of location information, eg link layers like IEEE 802.11.</p>"
