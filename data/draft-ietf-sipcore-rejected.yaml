abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 608 (Rejected) Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) response code. This response code enables calling parties to learn that
    an intermediary rejected their call attempt. No one will deliver, and thus answer,
    the call. As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that future attempts to contact
    the same User Agent Server will likely fail. The initial use case driving the
    need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine.
    In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process. This contrasts with
    the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code in which a human at the target User Agent
    Server indicates the user did not want the call. In some jurisdictions, this distinction
    is important. This document also defines the use of the Call-Info header field
    in 608 responses to enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their
    calls in error. This provides a remediation mechanism for legal callers that find
    their calls blocked.</p>"
