abstract:
- content: "<p>All known Feedback Generators (the operators of complaint feedback
    loops) have some criteria for acceptance of requests to receive feedback. This
    document is a review of such criteria, where publicly available. It is intended
    to inform design decisions within the Mail Abuse Reporting Format (MARF) Working
    Group [MARF-WG], and likely will never advance beyond internet-draft status. The
    information included herein was gathered from public web sites.</p>"
