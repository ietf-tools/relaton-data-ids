abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an initial set of identifiers to be used in
    the Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP). The MPLS-TP
    requirements (RFC 5654) require that the elements and objects in an MPLS-TP environment
    are able to be configured and managed without a control plane. In such an environment,
    many conventions for defining identifiers are possible. This document defines
    identifiers for MPLS-TP management and Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) functions compatible with IP/ MPLS conventions. This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
