abstract:
- content: "<p>This document elaborates a threat model for pervasive surveillance.
    We assume an adversary with an interest in indiscriminate eavesdropping that can
    passively observe network traffic at every layer at every point in the network
    between the endpoints. It is intended to demonstrate to protocol designers and
    implementors the observability and inferability of information and metainformation
    transported over their respective protocols, to assist in the evaluation of the
    performance of these protocols and the effectiveness of their protection mechanisms
    under pervasive passive surveillance.</p>"
