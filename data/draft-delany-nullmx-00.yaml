abstract:
- content: "<p>A common strategy of SMTP servers when deciding whether to accept an
    email or not, is to ensure that the 2821.MailFrom contains a domain willing to
    accept non-delivery email (aka bounces). When the 2821.MailFrom domain has a DNS
    MX Resource Record (RR), it is making an explicit statement that it is willing
    to accept email. However, when the domain has just a DNS A (or AAAA) RR, there
    is no such clarity as most hosts on the Internet advertise an A RR regardless
    of whether they want to accept email or not. The NULL MX RR formalizes the existing
    mechanism by which a domain communicates that it will never accept email.</p>"
