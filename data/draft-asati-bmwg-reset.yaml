abstract:
- content: <p>An operational forwarding device may need to be re-started (automatically
    or manually) for a variety of reasons, an event that we call a "reset" in this
    document. Since there may be an interruption in the forwarding operation during
    a reset, it is useful to know how long a device takes to begin forwarding packets
    again. This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset during benchmarking
    of forwarding devices, and provides clarity and consistency in reset test procedures
    beyond what's specified in RFC2544. It therefore updates RFC2544.</p>
