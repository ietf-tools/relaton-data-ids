abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of application-layer protocols make use of IP broadcasts or
    multicast messages for functions like local service discovery or name resolution.
    Some of these functions can only be implemented efficiently using such mechanisms.
    When using broadcasts or multicast messages, a passive observer in the same broadcast/
    multicast domain can trivially record these messages and analyze their content.
    Therefore, broadcast/multicast protocol designers need to take special care when
    designing their protocols.</p>"
