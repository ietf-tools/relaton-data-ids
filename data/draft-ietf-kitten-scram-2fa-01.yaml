abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes an extension to family of Simple Authentication
    and Security Layer (SASL; RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called the Salted
    Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides support for
    2 factor authentication. It also includes a separate extension for quick reauthentication.
    This specification also gives an example of how TOTP (RFC 6238) can be used as
    the second factor.</p>"
