abstract:
- content: "<p>Previously transport networks were typically static, lacked flexibility,
    and required long planning times when deploying new services. Network Providers
    and Service Providers have embraced technologies that allow separation of data
    plane and control plane, distributed signaling for path setup and protection,
    and centralized path computation for service planning and traffic engineering.
    Although these technologies provide significant benefits, they do not meet the
    growing need for network programmability, automation, resource sharing, and service
    elasticity necessary for meeting customer demands and evolving Internet applications
    By combining the aforementioned capabilities with network resource virtualization
    and abstraction mechanisms, available via well- defined customer interfaces, providing
    significant operational benefits to meet the growing demands from customers and
    applications. The work effort investigating this problem space is known as Abstraction
    and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN). This document provides an ACTN problem
    description, scope of work, and outlines the core requirements to facilitate network
    resource virtualization and resource slicing for customers and applications, across
    Service Provider and Network Provider transport network infrastructure.</p>"
