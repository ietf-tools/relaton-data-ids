abstract:
- content: "<p>The memo has been proposed to extend happy eyeballs algorithm to fit
    into multiple interfaces environment. Based on this extended heuristic algorithm,
    a client with multiple interface could determine the optimal flow path in which
    specific interface has been chosen. Furthermore, an appropriate IP address family
    for each interface can be also identified to guarantee user experiences during
    IPv6 transition period.</p>"
