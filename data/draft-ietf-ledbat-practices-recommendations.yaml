abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections. For example,
    P2P applications maintain connections to a number of different peers and web browsers
    perform concurrent download from the same web server. Application designers pursue
    different goals when doing so: P2P apps need to maintain a well-connected mesh
    in the swarm while web browsers mainly use multiple connections to parallelize
    requests that involve application latency on the web server side. However this
    practice also has impacts to the host and the network as a whole. For example,
    an application can obtain a larger fraction of the bottleneck than if it had used
    fewer connections. Although capacity is the most commonly considered bottleneck
    resource, middlebox state table entries are also an important resource for an
    end system communication. This document clarifies the current practices of application
    design involving concurrent TCP connections and reasons behind them, and discusses
    the tradeoffs surrounding their use, whether to one destination or to different
    destinations. Other resource types may exist, and the guidelines are expected
    to comprehensively discuss them.</p>"
