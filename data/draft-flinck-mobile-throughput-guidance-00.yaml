abstract:
- content: "<p>The behaviour of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which assumes
    that network congestion is the primary cause for packet loss and high delay, can
    lead to inefficient use of a cellular network's resources and degrade application
    performance. The root cause for this inefficiency is that TCP has difficulty adapting
    to the rapidly varying network conditions. In cellular networks, the bandwidth
    available for end devices can vary by an order of magnitude over a few seconds
    due to changes in the underlying radio channel conditions, as devices move, as
    well as changes in system load as other devices enter and leave the network. This
    document proposes a mechanism and protocol elements that can be used to assist
    TCP in cellular networks, ensuring high utilization and high service delivery
    performance. The document describes the applicability of the proposed mechanism
    for video delivery over cellular networks; it also presents test results.</p>"
