abstract:
- content: <p>The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks results
    in a low efficiency, as the size of the headers and the payload of these packets
    can be in the same order of magnitude. In some situations, multiplexing a number
    of small packets into a bigger one is desirable in order to improve the efficiency.
    For example, a number of small packets can be sent together between a pair of
    machines if they share a common network path. This may happen between machines
    in different locations or even inside a datacenter with a number of servers hosting
    virtual machines. Thus, the traffic profile can be shifted from small to larger
    packets, reducing the network overhead and the number of packets per second to
    be managed by intermediate routers. This document describes Simplemux, a protocol
    able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging to different protocols into
    a single packet. Small headers (separators) are added at the beginning of each
    multiplexed packet, including some flags, the packet length and a "Protocol" field.
    This allows the inclusion of a number of packets belonging to different protocols
    (the "multiplexed packets") on a packet of another protocol (the "tunneling protocol").
    In order to reduce the overhead, the size of the multiplexing headers is kept
    very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing packets of small size).</p>
