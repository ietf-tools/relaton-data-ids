abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an architectural framework for the application
    of the MPLS Indicator and Ancillary Data (MIAD) technologies. MIAD techmologies
    are used to indicate actions (I) for LSPs and/or packets and to transfer data
    needed for these actions (AD). The document describes a common set of protocol
    functions and information elements - the MPLS Indicartor and Ancillary Data -
    supporting additional operational models and capabilities of MPLS netwroks that
    support these functions. Some of these functions are defined in existing MPLS
    specifications, while others require extensions to existing specifications to
    meet the requirements in the MIAD requirement specification. This document is
    the result of work started in MPLS Open Desgign Team, with participation by the
    MPLS, PALS and DETNET working groups.</p>"
