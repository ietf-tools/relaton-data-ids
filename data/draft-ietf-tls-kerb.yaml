abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2712 [KERBTLS] introduced mechanisms for supporting Kerberos [KERB]
    authentication within the TLS protocol [TLS]. This document extends RFC 2712 to
    support delegation of Kerberos credentials. In this way, a TLS server may obtain
    a Kerberos service ticket on behalf of the TLS client. Thus, a single client identity
    may be used for authentication within a multi-tier architecture. This draft also
    proposes a mechanism for a TLS server to indicate Kerberos-specific information
    to the client within the certificate request message in the initial exchange.</p>"
