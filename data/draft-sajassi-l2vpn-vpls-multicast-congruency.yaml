abstract:
- content: "<p>The current VPLS multicast proposals based on multicast tree has several
    issues that are outlined in [BRIDGE-INTEROP]. These issues stems from the divergence
    of the multicast and unicast paths for a given VPLS instance in the MPLS/IP network.
    This draft describes a mechanism for building multicast and unicast paths that
    are congruent in order to address these issues.</p>"
