abstract:
- content: "<p>In highly dynamic, heterogeneous radio MANET environments where links
    are constantly changing, standardizing information exchange between the radio
    and router such that routers can make informed routing decision based on link
    layer information over heterogeneous link types becomes a key area to address.
    This document defines the basic framework for radio-to-router interface communications
    as well as requirements and considerations for evaluating radio-to-router interface
    technologies for use in MANETs.</p>"
