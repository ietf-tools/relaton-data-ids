abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is defined to provide end-to-end
    bounded latency and extremely low packet loss rates for critical flows. It's important
    to measure and monitor the packet loss rates and end-to-end delay and delay variation
    of a DetNet flow path, which allows evaluation of whether the Service Level Agreements
    (SLA) of the provided DetNet services are satisfied. These metrics are also useful
    in network/traffic planning, trouble shooting, and network performance evaluation.
    This document defines protocol mechanisms to support passive Performance Measurement
    (PM) for DetNet service.</p>"
