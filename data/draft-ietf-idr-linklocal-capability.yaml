abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP [RFC4271], was originally designed to provide reachability between
    domains and between the edges of a domain. As such, BGP assumes the next hop towards
    any reachable destination may not reside on the advertising speaker, but rather
    may either be through a router connected to the same subnet as the speaker, or
    through a router only reachable by traversing multiple hops through the network.
    Because of this, as per [RFC4291] - BGP does not recognize IPv6 link-local addresses,
    as a valid next hop for the forwarding purposes. This draft standardizes the operation
    of BGP over a point-to-point link using link-local IPv6 addressing only.</p>"
