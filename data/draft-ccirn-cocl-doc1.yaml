abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSI transport service may be realized through a variety of transport/network
    protocol combinations. Regrettably, few of the combinations actually interoperate
    with each other. As such, even if all OSI-capable end-systems enjoyed full-connectivity,
    they would not be able to uniformly interoperate. This memo examines the problem
    and proposes an approach in order to develop solutions to this problem.</p>"
