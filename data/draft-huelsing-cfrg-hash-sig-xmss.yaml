abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), a
    hash-based digital signature system. It follows existing descriptions in scientific
    literature. The note specifies the WOTS+ one-time signature scheme, a single-tree
    (XMSS) and a multi-tree variant (XMSS^MT) of XMSS. Both variants use WOTS+ as
    a main building block. XMSS provides cryptographic digital signatures without
    relying on the conjectured hardness of mathematical problems. Instead, it is proven
    that it only relies on the properties of cryptographic hash functions. XMSS provides
    strong security guarantees and, besides some special instantiations, is even secure
    when the collision resistance of the underlying hash function is broken. It is
    suitable for compact implementations, relatively simple to implement, and naturally
    resists side-channel attacks. Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based
    signatures withstand attacks using quantum computers.</p>"
