abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API),
    as defined in RFC-1508 and subsequent Internet Draft documents, provides security
    services to callers (applications) in a generic fashion, supportable with a range
    of underlying mechanisms and technologies, allowing source-level portability of
    applications to different environments. Multi-party security contexts, where security
    context information is shared amongst more than two session peers, have received
    little consideration within the scope of the GSS-API. This document describes
    details of one approach for supporting multi-party security services within the
    GSS-API.</p>"
