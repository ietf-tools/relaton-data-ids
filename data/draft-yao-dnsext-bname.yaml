abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new DNS Resource Record called "BNAME", which
    provides the capability to map itself and its subtree of the DNS name space to
    another domain. It differs from the CNAME record which only maps a single node
    of the DNS name space, from the DNAME which only maps the subtree of the DNS name
    space to another domain.</p>
