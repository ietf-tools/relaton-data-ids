abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (iCAP) [1] provides simple,
    object-based content vectoring for HTTP services. For some services, the iCAP
    server needs to identify the source of the encapsulated HTTP message. This document
    specifies user-defined header extensions of iCAP, which allow the iCAP client
    to include the IP address and possibly a subscriber ID of the source of the encapsulated
    HTTP message.</p>"
