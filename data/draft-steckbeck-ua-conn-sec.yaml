abstract:
- content: "<p>The user agent to server transaction has many attack surfaces which
    have been defended by various recommendations such as Content Security Policy.
    An attack vector that is currently exploited is the open connection policy to
    first, second- and third-party resources. A breach of the origin website or other
    connected resource could require the client to load resources from a malicious
    network. This document provides a framework which allows authors to publish authorized
    connectable second- and third-party resources that a user agent should or must
    follow depending on configuration of that user agent.</p>"
