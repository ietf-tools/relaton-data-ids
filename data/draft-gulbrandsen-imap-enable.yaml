- content: "<p>Most IMAP extensions are used by the client when it wants to and the
    server supports it. However, a few extensions require the server to know whether
    a client supports that extension. The ENABLE extension allows an IMAP client to
    say which extensions it supports. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
