abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a model for mapping the domain-qualified user
    and group names used in the Network File System version 4's Access Control List
    (ACL) entries (ACEs) to internal identifiers such as POSIX UIDs and GIDs, as well
    as reverse mappings as well as a protocol for effecting such mappings in a consistent
    way across a server cluster, site, or entire domain. The main goals of this model
    and protocol are to allow the use of user and group names from multiple domains
    to be used in POSIX environments as well as enabling multi-protocol fileserver
    implementations which must support the use of a variety of user and group identifiers.</p>"
