abstract:
- content: "<p>From the communication viewpoint, qubits are different from classical
    bits. A qubit may be transmitted directly but it can’t be cloned or measured without
    altering its state, so existing copy-and-resend schemes can’t be used to handle
    a transmission failure. Moreover, in some cases, the sender does not know the
    state of the transmitted qubit, so a qubit loss may cause irrevocable damage.
    This draft presents the causes of transmission failures, and analyses the vulnerabilities
    of several crypto protocols that such defects may bring forth. Thus, quantum teleportation
    is highly recommended for certain applications.</p>"
