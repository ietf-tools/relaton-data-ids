abstract:
- content: <p>This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to concerns
    about "pervasive monitoring" as articulated in [I-D.farrell-perpass- attack].
    It begins by exploring terminology that has been used in IETF standards (and in
    academic publications) to describe encryption and key management techniques, with
    a focus on authentication vs. anonymity. Based on this analysis, it propose a
    new term, "pervasive encryption" (PE) to describe a goal for IETF security protocols,
    one countermeasure to pervasive monitoring.</p>
