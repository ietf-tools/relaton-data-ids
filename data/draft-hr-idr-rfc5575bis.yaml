abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC5575 which defines a Border Gateway Protocol
    Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be
    used to distribute traffic flow specifications. This allows the routing system
    to propagate information regarding more specific components of the traffic aggregate
    defined by an IP destination prefix. This draft specifies IPv4 traffic flow specifications
    via a BGP NLRI which carries traffic flow specification filter, and an Extended
    community value which encodes actions a routing system can take if the packet
    matches the traffic flow filters. The flow filters and the actions are processed
    in a fixed order. Other drafts specify IPv6, MPLS addresses, L2VPN addresses,
    and NV03 encapsulation of IP addresses. This document updates RFC5575 to correct
    unclear specifications in the flow filters and to provide rules for actions which
    interfere (e.g. redirection of traffic and flow filtering). Applications which
    use the bgp flow specification are: 1) application which automate of inter-domain
    coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate
    (distributed) denial- of-service attacks; 2) application which control traffic
    filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service, and 3) applications with centralized
    control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context. Some of deployments of these three
    applications can be handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI traffic flow
    filters, and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community Flow Specification
    actions.</p>"
