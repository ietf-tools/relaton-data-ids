abstract:
- content: "<p>SSH (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a
    network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine
    to another. It provides strong authentication and secure communications over insecure
    networks. It is intended as a possible replacement for rsh, rlogin, rcp, and rdist.
    Ssh closes several security holes in existing remote login and file transfer protocols
    (IP spoofing, routing manipulation, DNS manipulation, trojan horses, man-in-the-middle
    attacks). Additionally, all communications are encrypted to ensure privacy and
    integrity. It automatically forwards X11 connections over the secure channel (providing
    secure X11 sessions and automatic secure authentication information distribution).
    Arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel. An authentication
    agent permits authentication keys to reside on a laptop, or eventually even on
    a smartcard. Ssh also includes several convenience features, such as returning
    the correct exit status, automatic setting of DISPLAY and X11 authentication data,
    enhanced configurability, and the ability to run remote commands on a pty.</p>"
