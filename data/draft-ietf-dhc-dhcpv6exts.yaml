abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [4] (DHCP) provides
    a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.
    Configuration parameters and other control information are carried in typed data
    items that are stored in the 'extensions' field of the DHCP message. The data
    items themselves are also called 'extensions.' This document specifies the initial
    set of DHCP extensions, which will be periodically updated as new extensions are
    defined until this document reaches proposed standard.</p>"
