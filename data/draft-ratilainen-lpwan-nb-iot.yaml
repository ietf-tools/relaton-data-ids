abstract:
- content: "<p>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies covering
    different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The common characteristics for
    LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small data sizes and long battery life
    operation. One of these technologies include Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT)
    developed and standardized by 3GPP. This document is an informational overview
    to NB-IoT and gives the principal characteristics and restrictions of this technology
    in order to help with the IETF work for providing IPv6 connectivity to NB-IoT
    along with other LPWANs.</p>"
