abstract:
- content: "<p>Most protocol developers ask themselves if a protocol will work, or
    work efficiently. These are important questions, but another less frequently considered
    is wether the proposed protocol changes present themselves barriers to adoption
    by deployed software (more importantly, needlessly so). This document seeks to
    provide information on the challenges to DHCP Option software implementers, and
    in doing so to provide guidance to prospective DHCP Option authors to help them
    produce options that are easily adoptable.</p>"
