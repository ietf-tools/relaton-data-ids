abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the architecture of the IP Telephony Border
    Gateway Protocol (TBGP). TBGP is an inter-domain protocol, for routing voice calls
    through the IP network towards their destinations, which may be inside the IP
    network, IP destinations, or outside it, PSTN destinations. TBGP's operation is
    independent of any VoIP call signaling protocols (H.323, SIP, MGCP, ...), but
    it can serve as the call routing protocol for any of these signaling protocols.
    TBGP is based on the Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4).</p>"
