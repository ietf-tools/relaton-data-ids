abstract:
- content: "<p>For some time now several equipment manufactures have been implementing
    what is called L2TP tunnel switching or L2TP multihop. Although this technology
    has several applications and is quite widespread, there has been no effort to
    standardize the nomenclature and methods associated with it. The goal of this
    document is to achieve a common denominator in what is tunnel switching, its advantages
    and nomenclature associated with it.</p>"
