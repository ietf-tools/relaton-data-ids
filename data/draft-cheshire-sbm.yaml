abstract:
- content: "<p>In the past decade there has been growing awareness about the harmful
    effects of bufferbloat in the network, and there has been good work on developments
    like L4S to address that problem. However, bufferbloat on the sender itself remains
    a significant additional problem, which has not received similar attention. This
    document offers techniques and guidance for host networking software to avoid
    network traffic suffering unnecessary delays caused by excessive buffering at
    the sender. These improvements are broadly applicable across all datagram and
    transport protocols (UDP, TCP, QUIC, etc.) on all operating systems.</p>"
