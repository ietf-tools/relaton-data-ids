abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines various forms of host multihoming, identifies
    the requirements associated with each and suggests means by which they could be
    supported in the IPv6 environment. The intention is to provoke discussion, leading
    to a general consensus as to which scenarios and requirements are important, and
    which potential solutions are appropriate for further study. It is an update to
    the previous draft &lt;draft-shand-ipv6-multi-homing-00.txt&gt; posted in February
    1996.</p>"
