abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarding multicast packets efficiently over an MPLS core requires
    Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) or Multi-Point-to-Multi-Point (MP2MP) LSP's between
    one or more Ingress routers and one or more Egress routers. For efficient forwarding
    core LSRs need to replicate labeled multicast packets where the branches of the
    P2MP/MP2MP tree diverge. This draft specifies LDP extensions that enable it to
    build P2MP/MP2MP LSPs in a receiver initiated manner.</p>"
