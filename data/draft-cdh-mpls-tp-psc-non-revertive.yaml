abstract:
- content: <p>This document optionally updates [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection", to change non-revertive operation to be aligned
    with the behavior defined in [RFC4427] and in an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's
    protection switching requirements. An operator command, Manual Switch to Working
    (MS-W) is also included to revert traffic to the working path in non-revertive
    operation.</p>
