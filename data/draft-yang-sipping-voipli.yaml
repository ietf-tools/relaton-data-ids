abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently broadband Voice over IP (VoIP) has a clear trend to substitute
    for traditional telephone services such as wire telephone, wireless telephone
    and mobile telephone service, it has become increasingly clear that VoIP services
    will be expected to provide Lawful Intercept to the same level experienced in
    the Public Switched Telephone Network(PSTN)[7]. In an effort to provide lawful
    interception for broadband VoIP, an architecture using session border controller
    was proposed, and a prototype implementation of the broadband VoIP lawful interception
    was created and basic performance evaluation was conducted on this prototype system.
    This document reports on the prototype implementation and the test results.</p>"
