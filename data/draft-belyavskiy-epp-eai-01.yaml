abstract:
- content: "<p>This document permits usage of Internationalized Email Addresses in
    the EPP protocol. The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), being developed
    before appearing the standards for Internationalized Email Addresses (EAI), does
    not support such email addressed. This document describes an EPP extension that
    allows EAI addresses to be used in contact mapping in the EPP protocol. TO BE
    REMOVED on turning to RFC: The document is edited in the dedicated github repo
    [1]. Please send your submissions via GitHub.</p>"
