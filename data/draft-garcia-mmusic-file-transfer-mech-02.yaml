abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a mechanism to negotiate the transfer of one
    or more files between two endpoints by using the Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) offer/answer model specified in RFC 3264. SDP is extended to describe the
    attributes of the files to be transferred. The offerer can either describe the
    files it wants to send, or the files it would like to receive. The answerer can
    either accept or reject the offer separately for each individual file . The transfer
    of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation. The Message
    Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default mechanism to actually
    carry the files between the endpoints. The conventions on how to use MSRP for
    file transfer are also provided in this document.</p>"
