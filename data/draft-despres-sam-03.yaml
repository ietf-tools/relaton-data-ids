abstract:
- content: "<p>The continuous growth of routing tables in the core of Internet is
    a challenge. It would become overwhelming if each multihomed customer site would
    need a provider independent prefix to take full advantage of its multihoming.
    IPv6 has the potential to solve this problem, but a complete specification is
    still missing. This draft proposes an approach for a solution. The Stateless Address
    Mapping (SAM) model, introduced for this, is applicable to a hierarchy of routing
    zones with multihoming permitted at each level, and with each zone using local
    addresses for its internal routing plan. End-to-end transparency of the Internet
    is maintains across these local-address zones, thanks to a systematic encapsulation
    of global-address packets into local-address packets. Local addresses are statelessly
    derived from prefixes found in global addresses, and from static parameters of
    traversed zones. Global prefixes delegated by a zone to its child interfaces can
    be obtained by autoconfiguration, thanks to to a bidirectional correspondence
    between SAM local addresses and SAM global prefixes. Deployment can be incremental.</p>"
