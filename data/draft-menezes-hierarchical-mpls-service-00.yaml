abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a network service model for service providers
    to deliver economical layer 2 VPN services using hierarchical MPLS. The service
    model builds on top of 2547 and BGP/MPLS and extends to building L2VPN services
    between customer sites with a scalable peering model. It reduces the cost of services
    for downstream providers by using a distance-insensitive IP Network Service Provider
    (NSP) as a WAN partner to connect distant regions. It simplifies downstream provider’s
    operation and improves the scalability of a traditional standard overlay model
    by allowing the downstream provider to peer with the upstream provider for both
    Internet transit and L2VPN services.</p>"
