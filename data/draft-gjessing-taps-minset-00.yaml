abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft will eventually recommend a minimal set of IETF Transport
    Services offered by end systems supporting TAPS, and give guidance on choosing
    among the available mechanisms and protocols. As a starting point for discussion,
    it currently only gives an overview of some ways to categorize the set of transport
    services in the first TAPS document (version 4: draft-ietf-taps-transports-04),
    assuming that the eventual minimal set of transport services will be based on
    a similar form of categorization.</p>"
