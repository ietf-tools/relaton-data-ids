abstract:
- content: "<p>In support of Segment Routing(SR), routing protocols advertise a variety
    of identifiers used to define the segments that direct packet forwarding. In cases
    where the information advertised by a given protocol instance is either internally
    inconsistent or conflicts with advertisements from another protocol instance a
    means of notifying the originator about the inconsistency is required. This document
    defines a generic mechanism to notify the BGP originator about the inconsistency
    in the network.</p>"
