abstract:
- content: "<p>The architecture for Delay Tolerant Networking includes a type of address
    called an Endpoint Identifier. This document describes some of the remaining issues
    regarding Endpoint Indentifiers, and how they can be configured and used in bundle
    forwarding. These either imply directions for future work or highlight clarifications
    that should be made in the current architecture and protocol documents.</p>"
