abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance
    criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE LSP. Such performance
    criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss or other indications such as the
    conformance to link performance objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic load. This
    specification uses network performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF
    and ISIS TE metric extensions (defined outside the scope of this document) to
    perform such path selections.</p>"
