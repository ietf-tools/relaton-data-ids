abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a client
    running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in
    to communications from that code. Since it requires one TCP connection for every
    WebSocket connection, having multiple WebSocket connections between the same client
    and the same server is inefficient. On the other hand, HTTP/2 specifies a fast,
    secure, multiplexed framing protocol. This document provides bi- directional multiplexed
    communication by layering WebSocket on top of HTTP/2. Please send feedback to
    the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list.</p>"
