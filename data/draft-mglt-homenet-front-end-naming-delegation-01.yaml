abstract:
- content: "<p>CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to the Home Network. Most
    of the CPEs are also providing the IP addresses of the nodes of the Home Network.
    This makes CPEs good candidates for hosting the Naming Service that would make
    devices reachable from the Home Network but also from the Internet. CPEs have
    not been designed to host a Naming Service reachable from the Internet. This would
    expose the CPEs and the Home Network to resource exhaustion which would result
    in making the Home Network unreachable, and most probably would also affect the
    Home Network inner communications. This document describes an Front End Naming
    Architecture where the CPEs manage the DNS(SEC) zone for its Home Network, and
    outsource the zone to Public Server for resolution coming from the Internet. The
    goal of the document is first to describe a Naming Architecture that fulfills
    Home Network Naming requirements without exposing the CPE to resource exhaustion.
    Then we intend the CPEs to be easily configured by the End Users, and describe
    the necessary information the End User is expect to provide to the CPE.</p>"
