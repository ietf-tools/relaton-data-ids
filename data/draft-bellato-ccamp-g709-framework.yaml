abstract:
- content: "<p>Along with the current development of packet over lambda switching
    (referred to as MPLambdaS), there are considerable developments in optical transport
    systems based on the ITU-T G.872 [ITUT-G872] and G.709 [ITUT-G709] specification.
    The Optical Transport Network (OTN) defined in G.872 and G.709 enables ultra-long-haul
    transmission of various client signal types through the use of Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) bytes. G.709 specifies the data plane transport structure and allocates
    overhead bytes for the OTN control plane.</p>"
