abstract:
- content: "<p>Establishment and control of Label Switch Paths (LSPs) have become
    mainstream tools of commercial and government network providers. One of the elements
    of further evolving such networks is scaling their performance in terms of LSP
    bandwidth and traffic loads, LSP intensity (e.g., rate of LSP creation, deletion,
    and modification), LSP set up delay, quality of service differentiation, and different
    levels of resilience. The goal of this document is to present target scaling objectives
    and the related protocol requirements for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS).</p>"
