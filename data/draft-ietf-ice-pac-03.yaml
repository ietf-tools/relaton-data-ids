abstract:
- content: "<p>During the process of establishing peer-to-peer connectivity, ICE agents
    can encounter situations where they have no candidate pairs to check, and, as
    a result, conclude that ICE processing has failed. However, because additional
    candidate pairs can be discovered during ICE processing, declaring failure at
    this point may be premature. This document discusses when these situations can
    occur and proposes a way to avoid premature failure. This document updates RFC
    8445 and RFC XXXX. [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number
    of draft-ietf-ice-trickle once it has been published. Please also indicate that
    this specification updates RFC XXXX.]</p>"
