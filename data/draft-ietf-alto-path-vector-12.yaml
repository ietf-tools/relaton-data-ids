abstract:
- content: <p>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization protocol [RFC7285]. While the current ALTO Cost Services only allow
    applications to obtain numerical/ordinal cost values on an end-to-end path defined
    by its source and destination, the present extension enables the provision of
    abstracted information on particular Abstract Network Elements on the path. These
    Abstract Network Elements, or simply Elements, are components of the network which
    handle data packets, and their properties may have an impact on the end-to-end
    performance of the applications' traffic. Examples of such Elements include physical
    devices such as routers, cables and interfaces, and aggregations of devices such
    as subnetworks and data centers. Such information is useful for applications whose
    performance is impacted by particular Abstract Network Elements they traverse
    or by their properties. Applications having the choice among several connection
    paths may use this information to select paths accordingly and improve their performance.
    In particular, they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent
    traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths. This document introduces a new cost
    type called Path Vector. A Path Vector is an array of entities that each identifies
    an Abstract Network Element (ANE). Each ANE is associated with a set of properties.
    ANE properties are conveyed by an ALTO information resource called "Property Map",
    that can be packed together with the Path Vectors in a multipart response. They
    can also be obtained via a separate ALTO request to a Property Map. An ALTO Property
    Map is an extension to the ALTO protocol, that is specified in another document
    entitled "Unified Properties for the ALTO Protocol" [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].</p>
