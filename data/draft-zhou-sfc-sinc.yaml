abstract:
- content: <p>This memo introduces "Signaling In-Network Computing operations" (SINC),
    a mechanism to enable in-packet operation signaling for in- network computing
    for specific scenarios like NetReduce, NetDistributedLock, NetSequencer, etc.
    In particular, this solution allows to flexibly communicate computation parameters
    to be used in conjunction with the packets' payload, to signal to in-network SINC-
    enabled devices the computing operations to be performed.</p>
