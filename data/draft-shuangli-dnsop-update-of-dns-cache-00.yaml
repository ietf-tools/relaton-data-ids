abstract:
- content: "<p>Under the caching mechanism in [RFC1035], the local DNS server cannot
    obtain the update status of the authoritative server in time, making the data
    inconsistent. Shortening TTL increases server load. In the passive query of the
    authoritative server, an active notification method is added to update the DNS
    mapping cache of the local DNS server in order to improve the efficiency of DNS
    resolution. Authoritative servers actively send DNS update packets after updating
    resource records. This document designs the API for receiving DNS update packets
    on the local DNS server.</p>"
