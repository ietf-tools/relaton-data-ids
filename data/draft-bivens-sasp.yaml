abstract:
- content: "<p>Entities responsible for distributing work across a group of systems
    traditionally do not know a great deal about the ability of the applications on
    those systems to complete the work in a satisfactory fashion. Workload management
    systems traditionally know a great deal about the health of applications, but
    have little control over the rate in which these applications receive work. The
    Server/Application State Protocol (SASP) provides a mechanism for load balancers
    and workload management systems to communicate better ways of distributing the
    existing workload to the group members. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
