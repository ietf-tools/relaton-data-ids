abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locator
    (EARL) URI scheme and the encoding and decoding of the associated content data.
    An EARL is a bearer token that allows an encrypted data object to be located,
    decrypted and authenticated using a compact URI form designed for human readability.
    A range of work factors is supported from 2^112 to 2^252. The plaintext data format
    consists of an initial header section containing metadata describing the payload,
    the payload itself and an optional section containing signature data. This document
    is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-udf.html.</p>"
