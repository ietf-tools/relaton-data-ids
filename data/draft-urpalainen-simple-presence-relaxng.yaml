abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a batch of Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)
    and its extension schemas written with the RELAX NG schema language. Unlike with
    the current W3C XML Schema language it is possible to write reasonable forwards
    and backwards compatible presence combination schemas. These RELAX NG schemas
    are stricter than the W3C Schemas and thus the instance documents that validate
    with these schemas follow the intended content model more closely. Especially,
    these schemas are targeted to actual implementations in order to decrease interoperability
    problems.</p>"
