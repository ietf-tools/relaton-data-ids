abstract:
- content: <p>While the wide use of IPv4 "private" addresses [RFC1918] lead to a great
    flexibilty degree of uninterconnected networks and use of IPv6 offer a huge address
    space; no "nice" mechanism exist to hide overlap of existing IPv4 "private" networks
    if and when the sum of used address spaces is greater than the IPv4 "private"
    address space. This document specifies how to walk around the matter without any
    coordination, renumbering or IPv6 adoption by overlapping networks owners.</p>
