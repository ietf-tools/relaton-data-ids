abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7344 specifies how DNS trust can be partially maintained in-band
    between parent and child. There are two features missing in that specification:
    initial trust setup and removal of trust anchor. This document addresses both
    these omissions. Changing a domain's DNSSEC status can be a complicated matter
    involving multiple unrelated parties. Some of these parties, such as the DNS operator,
    might not even be known by all organizations involved. The inability to disable
    DNSSEC via in-band signalling is seen as a problem or liability that prevents
    some DNSSEC adoption at large scale. This document adds a method for in-band signalling
    of this DNSSEC status changes. Initial trust is considered a much harder problem,
    this document will seek to clarify and simplify the initial acceptance policy.</p>"
