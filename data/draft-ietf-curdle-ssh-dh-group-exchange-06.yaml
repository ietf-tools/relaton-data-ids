abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diffie-Hellman (DH) Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) transport-layer
    protocol specifies that servers and clients should support groups with a minimum
    modulus group size of 1024 bits. Recent security research has shown that the minimum
    value of 1024 bits is insufficient to protect against state-sponsored actors and
    any organization with enough computing resources. This RFC updates RFC 4419, which
    allowed for DH moduli less than 2048 bits; now, 2048 bits is the minimum acceptable
    group size.</p>"
