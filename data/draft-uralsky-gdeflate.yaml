- content: "<p>This specification defines a lossless data compression algorithm optimized
    for high-throughput decompression on many-core data- parallel architectures. It
    is based on the original DEFLATE algorithm, modifying its bit stream layout to
    facilitate efficient SIMD decoding of the bitstream.</p>"
