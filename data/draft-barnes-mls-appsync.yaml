abstract:
- content: "<p>One feature that the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides
    is that it allows the members of a group to confirm that they agree on certain
    data. In this document, we define a mechanism for applications using MLS to exploit
    this feature of MLS to ensure that the group members are in agreement on the state
    of the application in addition to MLS-related state. We define a GroupContext
    extension that captures the state of the application and an AppSync proposal that
    can be used to update the application state.</p>"
