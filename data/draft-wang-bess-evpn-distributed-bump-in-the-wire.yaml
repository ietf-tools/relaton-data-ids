abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bump-in-the-wire use-case of Section 4.3 of [RFC9136] is a centerlized
    inter-subnet forwarding solution. The centerlized inter- subnet forwarding burdens
    the DGWs with the L3 traffics among different subnets inside the same DC. This
    draft extends the Bump-in-the-wire use-case of Section 4.3 of [RFC9136] in order
    to achieve a distributed inter-subnet forwarding solution.</p>"
