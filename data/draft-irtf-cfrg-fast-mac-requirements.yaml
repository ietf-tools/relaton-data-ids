abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines requirements guiding the development of a fast Message
    Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm suitable for use with many IETF protocols,
    but in particular routing protocols that use a MAC for packet authentication.
    It is widely conjectured that secure MACs that are fast in software are possible,
    and many interesting MACs have appeared in the literature. Nevertheless, none
    of these MACs have seen broad adoption, and none are a good match for the routing
    protocol case. We hope that this memo brings together MAC designers and MAC users
    for a fruitful discussion.</p>"
