abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability
    Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute traffic
    flow specifications. This allows the routing system to propagate information regarding
    more specific components of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination
    prefix. Additionally, it defines two applications of that encoding format: one
    that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such
    as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service attacks,
    and a second application to provide traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS
    VPN service. The information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol
    algorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes such as inter-provider
    peering agreements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
