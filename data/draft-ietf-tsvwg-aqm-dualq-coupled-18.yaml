abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a framework for coupling the Active Queue
    Management (AQM) algorithms in two queues intended for flows with different responses
    to congestion. This provides a way for the Internet to transition from the scaling
    problems of standard TCP Reno-friendly ('Classic') congestion controls to the
    family of 'Scalable' congestion controls. These achieve consistently very Low
    queuing Latency, very Low congestion Loss and Scaling of per-flow throughput (L4S)
    by using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in a modified way. Until the Coupled
    DualQ, these L4S senders could only be deployed where a clean-slate environment
    could be arranged, such as in private data centres. The coupling acts like a semi-permeable
    membrane: isolating the sub-millisecond average queuing delay and zero congestion
    loss of L4S from Classic latency and loss; but pooling the capacity between any
    combination of Scalable and Classic flows with roughly equivalent throughput per
    flow. The DualQ achieves this indirectly, without having to inspect transport
    layer flow identifiers and without compromising the performance of the Classic
    traffic. The solution has low complexity and requires no configuration for the
    public Internet.</p>"
