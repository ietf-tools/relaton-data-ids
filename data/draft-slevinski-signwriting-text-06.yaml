abstract:
- content: "<p>For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet universal,
    and because an international standard for the internet community should be documented
    and stable, this I-D has been released with the intention of producing an RFC
    to document the character use and naming conventions of the SignWriting community
    on the Internet. The SignWriting Script is an international standard for writing
    sign languages by hand or with computers. From education to research, from entertainment
    to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because people are using it to write
    signed languages. The SignWriting Script has two major families: Block Printing
    for the reader and Handwriting for the writer. Formal SignWriting uses ASCII strings
    to name logographic signs. The mathematical names are explained with tokens and
    regular expression patterns. Symbol keys reference the symbols of the International
    SignWriting Alphabet 2010. Coordinates define X and Y number values for 2-dimensional
    placement. Signs are written in a spatial SignBox, where each symbol is positioned
    with a 2-dimension coordinate. For sorting, each sign can have an optional temporal
    sequence of symbols that is outside of the SignBox and the visible text. To create
    sentences, completed signs are written sequentially, interspersed with punctuation
    symbols. The query language of Formal SignWriting uses a lite markup, similar
    to FSW, to define a variety of searching possibilities. The spatial SignBox can
    be searched for symbols or ranges of symbols. For each symbol or range, the search
    can specify if the symbol only needs to be found somewhere in the SignBox, or
    if the symbol needs to be found near certain coordinates. The temporal sequence
    can be searched for starting symbols, written as a sequential list of symbols
    and ranges of symbols. When searching the temporal sequence, the search results
    will be limited to signs that start with a matching temporal sequence. Each query
    string is transformed into one or more regular expressions. The regular expressions
    are used to quickly search large amounts of data. The styling string of Formal
    SignWriting uses a lite markup to define a variety of styling options. The entire
    sign can be customized for padding, coloring, and size. Individual symbols within
    a sign can be customized for coloring and size. SignWriting 2010 is the modern
    implementation and international specification of the SignWriting Script for the
    internet community that includes TrueType Fonts and a compact JavaScript library.
    SignMaker is a standards based editor, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, TrueType
    Fonts, and PNG images. SignMaker can be used to create a private dictionary or
    to view dozens of sign language dictionaries derived from SignPuddle Online. For
    Unicode, there are several encodings possibilities. Formal SignWriting is UTF-8.
    The plane 15 encoding is isomorphic with Formal SignWriting strings, using 3 characters
    for each symbol, along with structural marker characters and number characters.
    The plane 16 encoding is focused on the symbols only, using 1 character for each
    symbol. The Unicode 8 specification uses 1 to 3 characters on plane 1 to name
    each symbol of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010. Three appendices discuss
    additional topics to the standard. The first discusses the Modern SignWriting
    theory and example document, stable since January 12, 2012. The second discusses
    the symbol encoding of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010. The third
    discusses the SignPuddle Standards: licences, infrastructure, and compatibility.
    This memo concretely defines a conceptual character encoding map for the Internet
    community. It is published for reference, examination, implementation, and evaluation.
    Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>"
