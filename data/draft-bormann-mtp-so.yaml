abstract:
- content: "<p>MTP/SO is a reliable multicast protocol based on the earlier protocols
    MTP (RFC1301) and MTP-2, simplifying the protocol considerably while adding self-organization
    of the members of the group into a hierarchy of local regions, local retransmissions,
    local NAK damping, and both global and local forward error correction. MTP/SO
    retains the coordinated many-to-many multicast model of MTP-2 while improving
    scalability.</p>"
