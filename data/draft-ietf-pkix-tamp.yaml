abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a transport independent protocol for the management
    of trust anchors (TAs) and community identifiers stored in a trust anchor store.
    The protocol makes use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), and a digital
    signature is used to provide integrity protection and data origin authentication.
    The protocol can be used to manage trust anchor stores containing trust anchors
    represented as Certificate, TBSCertificate, or TrustAnchorInfo objects. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
