abstract:
- content: <p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by
    the email author. The address used by the email transport service is provided
    separately, through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO" command. Before final delivery,
    handling can entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using different
    destination addresses, that lead to the recipient. Also, the delivery process
    can produce local address transformations. It can be helpful for a message to
    have a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, and to include each
    address used for that recipient. This document defines a header field for this
    information. Email handling information is a matter of modifying the email infrastructure
    and possibly creating privacy concerns. A header field such as this is not automatically
    assured of adoption or use. Therefore it is being published as an Experiment,
    looking for constituency and for operational utility. This document is produced
    through the Independent RFC stream and was not subject to the IETF's approval
    process.</p>
