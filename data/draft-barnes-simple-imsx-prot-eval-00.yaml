abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is submitted to the SIMPLE WG as part of the ongoing
    discussion on the selection of the protocol for support of Session Based Instant
    Messaging. It evaluates the suitability of the IMSX protocol as a transport for
    Session Based IM. IMSX defines a BEEP profile for exchanging CPIM messages after
    SIP has performed its session setup signaling. This document evaluates IMSX against
    the IMPP requirements and its ability to interoperate with other IM systems based
    upon the CPIM profile.</p>"
