abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP [RFC 2002] defines media-independent procedures by which
    a Mobile Node can maintain existing transport and application-layer connections
    despite changing its point-of-attachment to the Internet and without changing
    its IP address. PPP [RFC 1661] provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol
    packets over point-to-point links. As currently specified, Mobile IP Foreign Agents
    which support Mobile Node connections via PPP can do so only by first assigning
    unique addresses to those Mobile Nodes, defeating one of the primary advantages
    of Foreign Agents. This documents corrects this problem by defining the Mobile-IPv4
    Configuration Option to the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) [RFC 1332].
    Using this option, two peers can communicate their support for Mobile IP during
    the IPCP phase of PPP. Familiarity with Mobile IP [RFC 2002], IPCP [RFC 1332],
    and PPP [RFC 1661] is assumed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
