abstract:
- content: <p>The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks results
    in a low efficiency, as the size of the headers and the payload of these packets
    can be in the same order of magnitude. In some situations, multiplexing (i.e.
    aggregating) a number of small packets into a bigger one is desirable in order
    to improve the efficiency. For example, a number of small packets can be sent
    together between a pair of machines if they share a common network path. This
    may happen between machines in different locations or even inside a datacenter
    with a number of servers hosting virtual machines. Thus, the traffic profile can
    be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and the
    number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers. This document
    describes Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging
    to different protocols into a single packet. Small headers (separators) are added
    at the beginning of each multiplexed packet, including some flags, the packet
    length and a "Protocol" field. This allows the inclusion of a number of packets
    belonging to different protocols (the "multiplexed packets") on a packet of another
    protocol (the "tunneling protocol"). In order to reduce the overhead, the size
    of the multiplexing headers is kept very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing
    packets of small size).</p>
