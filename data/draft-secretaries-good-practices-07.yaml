abstract:
- content: "<p>The Working Group Secretary's role was succinctly defined in RFC 2418.
    However, this role has greatly evolved and increased both in value and scope,
    since the writing of RFC 2418. This document thus provides a compilation of good
    practices and general guidelines regarding the fulfilment of the role. This document
    is intended for established Working Group Secretaries, individuals motivated by
    taking up that role, or anyone else simply interested in understanding better
    the Working Group Secretary's role. This document may also be useful for Working
    Group Chairs to better appreciate and help develop the value of Working Group
    Secretaries.</p>"
