abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the service mechanism for entering a delegation
    of DNS servers that provide reverse lookup of 6to4 IPv6 addresses into the 6to4
    reverse zone file. The mechanism is based on a conventional DNS delegation service
    interface, allowing the service client to enter the details of a number of DNS
    servers for the delegated domain. In the context of a 6to4 reverse delegation,
    the client is primarily authenticated by its source address used in the delegation
    request, and is authorized to use the function if its IPv6 address prefix corresponds
    to an address from within the requested 6to4 delegation address block. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
