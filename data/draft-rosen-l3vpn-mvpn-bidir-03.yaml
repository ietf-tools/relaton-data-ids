abstract:
- content: <p>The documents specifying multicast support for BGP/MPLS IP VPNs allow
    customer multicast data to be transported through a service provider's network
    through a set multicast tunnels. Such tunnels are advertised by BGP in a BGP attribute
    known as the "Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel Attribute". The
    base specifications allow the PMSI Tunnel Attribute to advertise bidirectional
    multicast distribution trees as "PMSI Tunnels"; however, those documents do not
    provide all the necessary details for using those tunnels. These details are provided
    in this document. This document also specifies the procedures for assigning customer
    multicast flows to specific bidirectional PMSI tunnels.</p>
