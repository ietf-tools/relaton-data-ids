abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a BGP SAFI with two NLRIs to advertise a candidate
    path of a Segment Routing (SR) Policy. An SR Policy is an ordered list of segments
    (i.e., instructions) that represent a source-routed policy. An SR Policy consists
    of one or more candidate paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists.
    A headend may be provisioned with candidate paths for an SR Policy via several
    different mechanisms, e.g., CLI, NETCONF, PCEP, or BGP. This document specifies
    how BGP may be used to distribute SR Policy candidate paths. It defines sub-TLVs
    for the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for signaling information about these candidate
    paths. This documents updates RFC9012 with extensions to the Color Extended Community
    to support additional steering modes over SR Policy.</p>"
