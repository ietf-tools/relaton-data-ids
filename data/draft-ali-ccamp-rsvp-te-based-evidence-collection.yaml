abstract:
- content: <p>The problem of path validation of a pure light-path in a Dense Wavelength
    Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical network requires the transmission of optical
    impairments related parameters along the provisioned route. In this draft we propose
    an RSVP-TE based mechanism to collect and evaluate optical impairments measured
    over optical nodes along the light-path. Conventions used in this document The
    key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119.</p>
