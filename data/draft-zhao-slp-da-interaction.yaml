abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol
    (mSLP). mSLP enhances the Service Location Protocol (SLP) with a scope-based fully-meshed
    peering Directory Agent (DA) architecture. Peer DAs exchange new service registrations
    in shared scopes via anti- entropy and direct forwarding. mSLP improves the reliability
    and consistency of SLP DA services, and simplifies Service Agent (SA) registrations
    in systems with multiple DAs. mSLP is backward compatible with SLPv2 and can be
    deployed incrementally. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
