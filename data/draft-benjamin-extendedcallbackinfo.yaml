abstract:
- content: "<p>AFS cache-control strategy is callback (invalidate) based. The AFS
    callback design allows a client to know when an object it has cached is no longer
    consistent, but the callback notification message itself provides no specific
    information about the triggering event. This is a protocol inefficiency, as in
    several scenarios it results in unnecessary round-trips to file servers to verify
    file status information, file access information, or to fetch file data which
    has not changed. We propose an extension of the callback mechanism to provide
    information about the event(s) triggering a callback, in the payload of the callback
    notification message itself. The proposed mechanism eliminates most or all unnecessary
    round-trips imposed by the current callback mechanism, and simultaneously allows
    AFS implementations to (efficiently) provide correct semantics in several scenarios
    involving multiple writers (ie, where AFS currently provides incorrect semantics).</p>"
