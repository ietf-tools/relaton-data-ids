abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an update to [RFC2131], which enables the dynamic
    leasing of shared IPv4 addresses and layer 4 source ports to DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
    clients [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6]. Shared addressing allows a single IPv4
    address to be allocated to multiple, active clients simulataneously. Clients sharing
    the same address are then differentiated by unique L4 source ports.</p>"
