abstract:
- content: <p>This document is an implementation report for the BGP Link-State Shortest
    Path First (SPF) Routing. The authors did not verify the accuracy of the information
    provided by respondents. The respondents are experts with the implementations
    they reported on, and their responses are considered authoritative for the implementations
    for which their responses represent. The respondents were asked to only use the
    "YES" answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.</p>
