abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a protocol that allows a router to learn the
    performance characteristics of the network to its neighbors when the shared media
    link between them may provide highly dynamic bandwidth characteristics. This information
    comes from the radio modems which are providing periodic updates about the quality
    of the radio signal to the routers listening for these updates on the same physical
    network segment. The functionality is similar to that described in "PPPoE Extensions
    for Credit Flow and Link Metrics" [RFC5578] but applied to a local area network
    topology rather than a set of point- to-point links.</p>
