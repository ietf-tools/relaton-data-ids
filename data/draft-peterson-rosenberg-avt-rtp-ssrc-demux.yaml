abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for the Real-Time Protocol (RTP)
    that allows multiple RTP sessions to be demultiplexed at a single port. Accordingly,
    it also requests that the IANA allocate assigned ports for the use of RTP with
    three applications: voice, video and text. A similar mechanism is proposed for
    the Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP). The use of this mechanism is confined to
    a strict domain of applicability.</p>"
