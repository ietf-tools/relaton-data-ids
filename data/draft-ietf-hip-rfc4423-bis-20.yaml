abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Host Identity (HI) namespace, which provides
    a cryptographic namespace to applications, and the associated protocol layer,
    the Host Identity Protocol, located between the internetworking and transport
    layers, that supports end-host mobility, multihoming, and NAT traversal. Herein
    are presented the basics of the current namespaces, their strengths and weaknesses,
    and how a HI namespace will add completeness to them. The roles of the HI namespace
    in the protocols are defined. This document obsoletes RFC 4423 and addresses the
    concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility. The Security
    Considerations section also describes measures against flooding attacks, usage
    of identities in access control lists, weaker types of identifiers, and trust
    on first use. This document incorporates lessons learned from the implementations
    of RFC 7401 and goes further to explain how HIP works as a secure signaling channel.</p>"
