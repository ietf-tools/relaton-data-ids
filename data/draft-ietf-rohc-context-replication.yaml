abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines context replication, a complement to the context
    initialization procedure found in Robust Header Compression (ROHC), as specified
    in RFC 3095. Profiles defining support for context replication may use the mechanism
    described herein to establish a new context based on another already existing
    context. Context replication is introduced to reduce the overhead of the context
    establishment procedure. It may be especially useful for the compression of multiple
    short-lived flows that may be occurring simultaneously or near-simultaneously,
    such as short-lived TCP flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
