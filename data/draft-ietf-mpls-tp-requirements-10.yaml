abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP). This document is a product of a joint effort of the International Telecommunications
    Union (ITU) and IETF to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network as defined by International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T). This work is based on two sources of requirements:
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures as defined by IETF, and packet transport networks
    as defined by ITU-T. The requirements expressed in this document are for the behavior
    of the protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute building blocks out
    of which the MPLS Transport Profile is constructed. The requirements are not implementation
    requirements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
