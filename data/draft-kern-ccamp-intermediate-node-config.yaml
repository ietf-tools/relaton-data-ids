abstract:
- content: "<p>Lately, a few use-cases have been identified where, besides path setup,
    specific configuration of intermediate nodes is required for the establishment
    of an LSP with its associated functions. Today, RSVP-TE is not supporting the
    selective configuration of intermediate nodes; hence extensions are required to
    equip RSVP-TE with such a capability. In this document we summarize the use-cases
    and their requirements and sketch alternative solutions to configure intermediate
    nodes. Since one of the main issues with intermediate node configuration is the
    introduction of potential scaling problems, we included scalability in our analysis.
    This document does not specify any extensions; its sole purpose is to foster discussion
    on the subject.</p>"
