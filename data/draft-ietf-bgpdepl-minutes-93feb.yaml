abstract:
- content: "<p>This note documents the results of a meeting held to coordinate the
    initial deployment of BGP-4 and CIDR aggregation. The attendees represented a
    number of transit network providers who plan to deploy BGP-4 as soon as it is
    available. This formed a subset of the members of the BGP Deployment Working Group,
    but was not an official meeting of the Working Group. The results of this meeting
    are relevant to the Working Group, and will be discussed at its next official
    meeting.</p>"
