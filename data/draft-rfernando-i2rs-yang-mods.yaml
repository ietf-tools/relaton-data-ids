abstract:
- content: <p>Interface to Routing Systems (I2RS) provides the mechanisms for the
    programmatic access of routing system components. YANG [RFC 6020] is a modeling
    language that is used to specify an external visible data model of sub-system
    - for defining both configuration and operational data held in the networking
    device. NETCONF is the protocol that is used to perform these configurations and
    accessing the operational data. This document proposes to use the YANG data modeling
    language for I2RS data models. It also proposes a set of YANG language changes
    to enable the I2RS data models for multi-client and programmatic access. This
    document also proposes the scope for the I2RS programmed data set on the Routing
    System and the necessary mechanisms for data synchronization. This document also
    recommends a binary encoding for "on-the-wire" transfer of the YANG data model
    elements instead of XML.</p>
