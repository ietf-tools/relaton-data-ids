abstract:
- content: <p>OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates, made up
    of primary keys, revocation signatures, direct key signatures, user IDs, identity
    certifications ("signature packets"), subkeys, and so on. They are often assembled
    by merging multiple certificates that all share the same primary key, and are
    distributed in public keystores. Unfortunately, since many keystores permit any
    third-party to add a certification with any content to any OpenPGP certificate,
    the assembled/merged form of a certificate can become unwieldy or undistributable.
    Furthermore, keystores that are searched by user ID or fingerprint can be made
    unusable for specific searches by public submission of bogus certificates. And
    finally, keystores open to public submission can also face simple resource exhaustion
    from flooding with bogus submissions, or legal or other risks from uploads of
    toxic data. This draft documents techniques that an archive of OpenPGP certificates
    can use to mitigate the impact of these various attacks, and the implications
    of these concerns and mitigations for the rest of the OpenPGP ecosystem.</p>
