abstract:
- content: "<p>This protocol intended to provide cooperation between mobile routers
    in a mobile network. A mobile network is usually connected to the Internet through
    mobile routers with wireless interfaces. Link quality of the wireless interface
    changes frequently and rapidly. In case of several mobile routers in a mobile
    network, MNN should use the MR that has the best link quality. This protocol makes
    all MRs in a mobile network share link quality of MRs each other. Propagation
    of routing information in a mobile network is not out of sight of this draft.</p>"
