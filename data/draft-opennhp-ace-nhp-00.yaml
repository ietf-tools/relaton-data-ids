abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP) is a cryptography-
    based session-layer protocol designed to implement Zero Trust principles by rendering
    protected network resources invisible to unauthorized entities. By requiring authentication
    before connection and operating at OSI layers 5, NHP conceals IP addresses, ports,
    and domains from exposure to reconnaissance and automated exploitation, effectively
    reducing the attack surface. This draft defines the architecture, message format,
    and workflow of the NHP protocol, outlines its security objectives, and provides
    guidance for integration into modern network infrastructures and Zero Trust deployments.</p>"
