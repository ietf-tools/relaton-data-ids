abstract:
- content: "<p>When the MPLS Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) was specified circa
    1999, there were very strong requirements that LDP should use a cryptographic
    hash function to sign LDP protocol messages. MD5 was widely used at that time,
    and was the obvious choices. However, even when this decision was being taken
    there were concerns as to whether MD5 was a strong enough signing option. This
    discussion was briefly reflected in section 5.1 of RFC 5036 [RFC5036] (and also
    in RFC 3036 [RFC3036]). Over time it has been shown that MD5 can be compromised.
    Thus, there is a concern shared in the security community and the working groups
    responsible for the development of the LDP protocol that LDP is no longer adequately
    secured. This document deprecates MD5 as the signing method for LDP messages.
    The document also selects a future method to secure LDP messages - the choice
    is TCP-AO. In addition, we specify that the TBD cryptographic mechanism is to
    be the default TCP-AO security method.</p>"
