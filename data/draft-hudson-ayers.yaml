abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses guidelines for specifying low-power Internet
    protocols in order to improve implementation interoperability. These guidelines
    are based around the importance of balancing memory usage and energy efficiency,
    and the importance of not relying on Postel's law when dealing with low resource
    devices. This document applies these guidelines to the IPv6 over low-power wireless
    personal area networks (6LoWPAN) Internet Standard, suggesting changes that would
    make it more likely for implementations to interoperate.</p>"
