abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines protocols to provide efficient air-ground communications
    without associated need for aircraft to maintain stateful connection to ground-tower
    infrastructure. Instead, a secure source-routed ground infrastructure will not
    only provide the needed routing intelligence, but also reliable packet delivery
    through inclusion of Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) to address both reliable wireless packet delivery, and assured terrestrial
    packet delivery.</p>"
