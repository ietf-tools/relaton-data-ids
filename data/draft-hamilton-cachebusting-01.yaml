abstract:
- content: "<p>Cachebusting is the sometimes deliberate, sometimes inadvertant, practice
    of defeating caching. This document explains the nature of the problem with relation
    to proxy cache servers using the World-Wide Web's HTTP protocol, and outlines
    some simple measures which may be taken to make an HTTP based service more 'cache
    friendly'. Since Web caching is still a novel concept, we also explain the basic
    principles behind it. This document should be read by developers of HTTP based
    products and services - we assume that the reader is already familiar with HTTP.</p>"
