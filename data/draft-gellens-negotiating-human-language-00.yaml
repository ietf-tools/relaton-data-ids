abstract:
- content: <p>Users have various human language needs, abilities, and preferences
    regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. When establishing interactive
    communication "calls" there needs to be a way to communicate and ideally match
    (i.e., negotiate) the caller's needs, abilities, and preferences with the capabilities
    of the called party. This is especially important with emergency calling, where
    a call can be routed to a PSAP or call taker capable of communicating with the
    user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call during setup,
    but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling an
    airline reservation desk). This document describes the need and expected use,
    and discusses the solution using either an existing or new SDP attribute.</p>
