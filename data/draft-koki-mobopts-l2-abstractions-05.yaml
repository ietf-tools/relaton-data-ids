abstract:
- content: <p>This draft proposes unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fast handovers.
    For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol layer to know
    or utilize other layer's information such as a form of L2 triggers. However, each
    protocol layer is basically designed independently. Since each protocol layer
    is also implemented independently in current operating systems, it is very hard
    to exchange control information between protocol layers. To solve the problem,
    this draft defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of "primitive" to
    achieve fast handovers in the network layer. This mechanism is called "L3-driven
    fast handovers" because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using
    the "primitives".</p>
