abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how Host Identity Protocol (HIP) can be utilized
    in Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) networks. Peers in a P2PSIP
    network need to have long-lived connections to other peers in the network, and
    HIP can be utilized to setup and maintain those connections. HIP is a good choice
    for connection maintenance, because it provides functionalities like Network Address
    Translation (NAT) traversal, mobility, multi-homing, and enhanced security properties.</p>"
