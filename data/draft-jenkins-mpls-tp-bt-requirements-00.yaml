abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines BT's requirements for MPLS-TP features based
    on our current thinking for how we may utilise functionality being defined as
    part of the MPLS-TP standardisation effort within our existing deployed MPLS networks.
    This document is not intended to describe all future requirements for MPLS-TP
    features, only for those features that we have a currently defined requirement
    for today and which we would like to see priority be given to them when specifying
    and standardising MPLS-TP within IETF. These features are required in order to
    enable us to enhance live, revenue generating services.</p>"
