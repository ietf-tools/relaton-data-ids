abstract:
- content: "<p>Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and integrate
    the cost-performance and QoS assurance of Layer 2 devices and the flexibility
    and functionality of Layer 3 protocols. Some of these proposals assume that Label
    Switching Routers (LSRs) are placed in a homogeneous LSR cloud in a campus area
    network or a backbone network, and they are connected directly to each other.
    However, this assumption sometimes does not hold true in the real situation. For
    example, some campuses will be connected via ATM SVC service, and LSR networks
    will be constructed hierarchically. To deal with Virtual Connections (VCs) in
    these environments, this document proposes to identify a VC with a VCID instead
    of a label.</p>"
