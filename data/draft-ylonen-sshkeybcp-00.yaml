abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents current recommended practice for configuring,
    managing, auditing, and associated policies around automated access to information
    systems, with particular emphasis on SSH user keys as authentication and authorization
    tokens but also looking into other automated access mechanisms, such as Kerberos.
    Starting with a review of authentication methods that can be configured for automated
    access, the document describes the risks involved when the management of automated
    access and SSH keys is neglected. It scopes the extent of the problem in particular
    organizations, provides a detailed roadmap for bringing automated access and SSH
    keys under control, and presents recommendations on continuous monitoring and
    ongoing management of automated access in information systems. Various remedial
    actions are presented and mapped to the problems they address and residual risks
    in the event the recommendations are not implemented. Guidance is also provided
    on how to organize management of automated access with the objective of reducing
    the system administration burden and organization operational cost, and on tools
    for automating the process.</p>"
