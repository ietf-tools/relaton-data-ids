abstract:
- content: "<p>The Quality of Experience of fixed network user can be improved with
    multiple WAN interfaces Residential Gateway (RG), i.e. RG supporting more than
    one WAN interface (e.g. LTE and DSL), so that it can take benefit of multihoming
    advantages. This document discusses the use of IP mobility protocols (NEMO [RFC3753]
    and Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275]), and their Multiple care-of-address extension [RFC5648],
    to meet multihomed RG requirements. This document also defines a new mobility
    option, the bonding option, for IP mobility protocols. This option is used by
    the mobility entities to configure the interface bonding where packets, of a given
    IP flow, are distributed.</p>"
