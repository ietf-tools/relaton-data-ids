abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a framework for authorization in constrained-node
    networks, i.e. networks where some devices have severe constraints on memory,
    processing, power and communication bandwidth. The main goal is to offload constrained
    devices by providing them access control support from trusted parties that are
    less constrained. The approach is based on RESTful requests to dedicated access
    management resources, supporting different authorization schemes and communication
    security paradigms.</p>"
