abstract:
- content: "<p>Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP version
    4. Pip is a general purpose internet protocol, designed to handle all forseeable
    internet protocol requirements. This specification is one of a number of documents
    that specify the operation of Pip. This specification describes the conventions
    for using the various Pip addresses--the hierarchical unicast address, the class-D
    style multicast address, the CBT multicast address, and the nearcast address.
    This specification does not describe how Pip addresses are assigned.</p>"
