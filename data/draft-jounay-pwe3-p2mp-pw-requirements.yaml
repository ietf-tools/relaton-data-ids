abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of requirements for providing an unidirectional
    Point-to-Multipoint PWE3 (Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge) emulation. The requirements
    identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling and maintenance
    aspects of a Point-to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines
    for the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential applications
    Point-to-Multipoint PWs SHOULD be used to optimize the support of multicast services
    as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network working group.</p>"
