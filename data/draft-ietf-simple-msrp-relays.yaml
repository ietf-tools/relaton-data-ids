abstract:
- content: "<p>Two separate models for conveying instant messages have been defined.
    Page-mode messages stand alone and are not part of a Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) session, whereas session-mode messages are set up as part of a session using
    SIP. The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is a protocol for near real-time,
    peer-to-peer exchanges of binary content without intermediaries, which is designed
    to be signaled using a separate rendezvous protocol such as SIP. This document
    introduces the notion of message relay intermediaries to MSRP and describes the
    extensions necessary to use them. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
