abstract:
- content: "<p>In PIM-SM networks PIM Null-Register messages are sent by the Designated
    Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the presence of Multicast sources
    in the network. There are periodic PIM Null-Registers sent from the DR to the
    RP to keep the state alive at the RP as long as the source is active. The PIM
    Null-Register message carries information about a single Multicast source and
    group. This document defines a standard to send multiple Multicast source and
    group information in a single PIM Packed Null-Register message. We will refer
    to the new packed formats as the PIM Packed Null- Register format and PIM Packed
    Register-Stop format throughout the document. This document also discusses interoperability
    between the PIM routers which do not understand the PIM Packed Null-Register format
    and routers which do understand it.</p>"
