abstract:
- content: '<p>This document documents the consensus reached by the Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Working Group within the IETF to focus its efforts on "Resource
    Reservation Protocol (RSVP)-TE: Extensions to RSVP for Label- Switched Paths (LSP)
    Tunnels" (RFC 3209) as the MPLS signalling protocol for traffic engineering applications
    and to undertake no new efforts relating to "Constraint-Based LSP Setup using
    Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)" (RFC 3212). The recommendations of section
    6 have been accepted by the IESG. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>'
