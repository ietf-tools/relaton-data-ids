abstract:
- content: "<p>Connecting Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) to the Internet is
    expected to provide significant benefits to these networks in terms of interoperability,
    application deployment, and management, among others. However, the constraints
    of LPWANs, often more extreme than those of typical 6Lo(WPAN) technologies, constitute
    a challenge for the 6LoWPAN suite in order to enable IPv6 over LPWAN. Considering
    the typical characteristics of LPWAN technologies, this document analyzes the
    design space and challenges related with enabling IPv6 over LPWAN.</p>"
