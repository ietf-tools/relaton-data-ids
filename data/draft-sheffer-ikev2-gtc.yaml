abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite many years of effort, simple username-password authentication
    is still prevalent. In many cases a password is the only credential available
    to the end user. IKEv2 uses EAP as a sub-protocol for user authentication. This
    provides a well-specified and extensible architecture. To this day EAP does not
    provide a simple password- based authentication method. The only existing password
    authentication methods either require the peer to know the password in advance
    (EAP-MD5), or are needlessly complex when used within IKEv2 (e.g. PEAP). This
    document codifies the common practice of using EAP-GTC for this type of authentication,
    with the goal of achieving maximum interoperability. The various security issues
    are extensively analyzed.</p>"
