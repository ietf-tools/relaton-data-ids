abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a new IPv6 address state called "Uncertain"
    address state as an extension of IPv6 address state specification. "Uncertain"
    address state is designed to introduce two functionalities. One is to achieve
    "Temporary Address Reservation" function. The other is to avoid a DAD (Duplicate
    Address Detection) time consuming problem for dynamically created addresses. New
    "Uncertain" Address State is inserted between "Tentative" address state and "Valid"
    address state. After "Tentative" address state (DAD operation has finished) for
    a newly created address, its state will enter to "Uncertain" address state. While
    an address stay at "Uncertain" address state, the address is behaved as if it
    is temporary reserved by the node exclusively. (The other nodes can not obtain
    such a reserved address.) When it becomes really necessary for the node to utilize
    the temporary reserved address, its address state is changed into "Valid" address
    state without accompanying time consuming DAD operation. By these procedures,
    we can avoid the DAD problem.</p>
