abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of a Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across
    a network and update paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands.
    PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which
    are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP). SDN has a much broader applicability than signal MPLS traffic-
    engineered (TE) paths, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of
    use cases including static LSPs, Segment Routing (SR), Service Function Chaining
    (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. It is, therefore, reasonable
    to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow
    the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. A PCE as a Central Controller
    (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending
    it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. This
    document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines its
    applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through
    a number of use cases. PCEP extensions which required for the PCECC use cases
    are covered in separate documents.</p>"
