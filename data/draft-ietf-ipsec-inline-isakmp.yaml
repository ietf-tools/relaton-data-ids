abstract:
- content: "<p>The current proposal for IP-layer key management [ISAKMP, OAKLEY, ISAOAK]
    has fairly high overhead. Before a security association can be established, at
    least one pair of messages need to be exchanged between the communicating peers.
    For efficiency, this suggests that ISAKMP setup should be infrequent. However,
    general principles of key management suggest that individual keys should be used
    as little as practical and changed as frequently as possible. Steve Bellovin has
    suggested that, ideally, different security associations should be used for each
    different transport-level connection[BADESP]. This document discusses a way of
    structuring a protocol to permit this to happen with minimal overhead, both in
    round-trip delay at connection setup, and in bandwidth once the connection is
    established. The general concept of inline or in-band keying here was inspired
    by SKIP[SKIP]. However, SKIP's approach is burdened by the addition of an extra
    intermediate header of perhaps 20 to 28 bytes to every protected packet, which
    doubles the bandwidth overhead of protected traffic compared with ESP with fixed
    keying. In order to minimise the per-packet overhead, an inline keying header</p>"
