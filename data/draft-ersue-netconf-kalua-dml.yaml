- content: "<p>This document specifies a Data Modeling Language (Kalua DML), which
    is designed to be used as a specification language for the payload of the IETF
    NETCONF protocol [RFC4741] as well as to specify other management related data
    models. The Kalua DML aims to fit the requirements specified in draft-linowski-netconf-dml-requirements
    [Linowski] and supports most of the requirements in RCDML [RCDML]. Comments can
    be sent to ngo@ietf.org.</p>"
