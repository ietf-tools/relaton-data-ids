abstract:
- content: "<p>The security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (OSCORE) provides end-to-end protection of messages exchanged with the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP). Messages protected with OSCORE include a CoAP OSCORE
    option, where the field Partial IV specifies the sequence number value used by
    the message sender. In the interest of encrypting as much information as reasonably
    possible, this document defines a lightweight add-on method for encrypting the
    Partial IV within the OSCORE option. Therefore, it updates RFC 8613. Combined
    with the update of OSCORE identifiers, the encryption of Partial IV values helps
    counteracting on-path adversaries that attempt to correlate the sequence numbers
    observed in different network paths, in order to track OSCORE endpoints that perform
    a network path migration. The defined encryption method is applicable also to
    the security protocol Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (Group OSCORE).</p>"
