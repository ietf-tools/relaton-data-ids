abstract:
- content: "<p>The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) protocol has,
    until now, required the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the underlying transport
    layer. This document defines RADIUS over the Transmission Control Protocol (RADIUS/TCP),
    in order to address handling issues related to RADIUS over Transport Layer Security
    (RADIUS/TLS). It permits TCP to be used as a transport protocol for RADIUS only
    when a transport layer such as TLS or IPsec provides confidentiality and security.
    This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
