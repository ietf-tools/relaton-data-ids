abstract:
- content: "<p>The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit Media Access Control (MAC)
    address space in such a way that half of it was reserved for local use. In 2017,
    the IEEE published a new standard (IEEE Std 802c) with a new optional Structured
    Local Address Plan (SLAP). It specifies different assignment approaches in four
    specified regions of the local MAC address space. The IEEE is developing protocols
    to assign addresses (IEEE P802.1CQ). There is also work in the IETF on specifying
    a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to handle the local MAC address
    assignments. This document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a
    DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant to the server
    so that the server may allocate MAC addresses in the quadrant requested by the
    relay or client. A new DHCPv6 option (QUAD) is defined for this purpose.</p>"
