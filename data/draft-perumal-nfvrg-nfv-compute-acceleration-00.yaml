abstract:
- content: "<p>Network functions are being virtualized and moved to industry standard
    servers. Steady growth of traffic volume requires more compute power to process
    the network functions. Network packet based architecture provides a lot of scope
    for parallel processing. Generic parallel processing can be done in common multicore
    platforms like GPUs, coprocessors like Intel Xeon Phi[6][7] and Intel[7]/AMD[10]
    multicore CPUs. In this draft to check the feasibility and to exploit this parallel
    processing capability, multi string matching is taken as the sample network function
    for URL filtering. Aho-Corasick algorithm has been made use for multi pattern
    matching. Implementation utilizes OpenCL [3] to support many common platforms[7][10][11].
    A list of optimizations is done, the application is tested on Nvidia Tesla K10
    GPUs. A common API for NFV Compute Acceleration has been proposed.</p>"
