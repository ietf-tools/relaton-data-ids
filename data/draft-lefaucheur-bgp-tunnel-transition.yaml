abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the common operational environments of IPv4
    Service Providers wanting to add IPv6 services to their service portfolio but
    not wanting (yet) to upgrade their IPv4 backbone to IPv6 routing. Two main transition
    scenarios are identified. We recommend that the 'MP-BGP over IPv6' and 'MP-BGP
    over IPv4' approaches defined in [BGP-TUNNEL] be respectively used for each of
    the two transition scenarios.</p>"
