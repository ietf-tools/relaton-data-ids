abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft suggests an object-centric naming system including name
    space and name resolution system for the IOT environment. A name space is defined
    to cover diverse IOT objects. To consider scalability and distributed architecture,
    the format of the name space consists of object category, local name, domain name,
    and parameters. Then, registries and servers are introduced to manage mapping
    between identifier and object names with one-to-many relationship. Then, name
    registration and resolution using these registries and servers are described.</p>"
