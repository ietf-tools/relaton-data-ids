abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a TTL-number space ''partition'' mechanism to shield
    the access control/management plane of a service provider's (SP) core network
    from customer traffic. Provider edge routers limit the TTL to a preset maximum
    value on_user_data packet that enters core network, and the core network router
    drops packet with a TTL as small as or smaller than preset value when the packet
    destination address is the router itself. Since attack packets from a customer
    site cannot reach the control plane or application of routers in the SP core network,
    the control plane of the core network is secured against the class of attacks
    originating outside the core network.</p>"
