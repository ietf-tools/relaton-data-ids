abstract:
- content: "<p>When there are too many customer-MACs (C-MACs), the RRs and/or ASBRs
    will be overloaded by the RT-2 routes for these MACs according to [RFC7432]. This
    issue can be simply solved by making the remote C-MAC entries learnt via data-plane
    MAC learning (like what PBB VPLS have done since [RFC7041]) rather than received
    from RT-2 routes. This simplified solution will works as well as PBB VPLS. But
    this simplified solution will lose many important features that based on the ESI
    concept. Because the ingress-ESI can't be learnt via data- plane MAC learning
    at the egress PE. So when the data packets is forwarded following these MAC entries,
    they can't benefit from the EAD/EVI routes as per RFC7432. So the All-Active Redundancy
    mode for ES can't be supported. This make the simplified solution can't work as
    well as PBB EVPN ([RFC7623]). This document proposes some new extensions to [RFC7432]
    to achieve all-active mode ES redundancy on TPEs and reduce the C-MAC loads for
    RRs and ASBRs at the same time. The new solution will work even more better than
    PBB EVPN under the help of these extensions, especially when there is no deployment
    of MPLS dataplane. In Section 6.2, this draft is compared with PBB EVPN and other
    solutions. These solutions are PBB EVPN, PBB VPLS, VXLAN([RFC7348]).</p>"
