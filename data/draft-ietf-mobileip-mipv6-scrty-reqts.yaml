abstract:
- content: "<p>The IESG returned the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) draft to the working group
    due to concerns about the security and scalability of binding updates (BUs) sent
    to correspondent nodes and the associated IPsec processing that is specified in
    the draft. Since that time discussions have continued to attempt to define what
    is really needed to make binding updates secure while taking into consideration
    the aspect of scalability as well as the fact that IPsec may not be the most suitable
    security mechanism for securing BUs between MNs and CNs.</p>"
