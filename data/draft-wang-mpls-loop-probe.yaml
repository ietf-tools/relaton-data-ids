abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper introduces a very simple mechanism, based on 'probe' message,
    which can be used for loop avoidance in the case that a LSP is changed. This probe
    mechanism is based on the idea that in the situation of one LSR has a new next
    hop and changes the LSP to new next hop, if this change leads to a loop, the only
    reason for the loop formation is that the LSR changes its next hop. So that we
    use a very simple length-fixed probe message, no state is needed to keep in the
    tandem LSRs, and the message primitives are very limited and simple. Also this
    method is flexible and robust.</p>"
