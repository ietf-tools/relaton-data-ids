abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3775 contains no way for a home agent to notify a mobile node that
    the home agent will shortly become unavailable, and suggest possible substitutes.
    A mobile node can suddenly find itself without mobility service. This document
    describes a simple protocol to inform the mobile node when its home agent is about
    to become unavailable and whether the mobile node should re-run bootstrapping
    to find a new home agent.</p>"
