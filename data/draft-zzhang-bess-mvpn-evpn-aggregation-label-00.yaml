abstract:
- content: "<p>The MVPN specifications allow a single Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) tunnel
    to carry traffic of multiple VPNs. The EVPN specifications allow a single P2MP
    tunnel to carry traffic of multiple Broadcast Domains (BDs). These features require
    the ingress router of the P2MP tunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label
    for each VPN or for each BD. A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label
    that is mapped to its VPN or BD. (In some cases, a distinct upstream-assigned
    is needed for each flow.) Since each ingress router allocates labels independently,
    with no coordination among the ingress routers, the egress routers may need to
    keep track of a large number of labels. The number of labels may need to be as
    large (or larger) than the product of the number of ingress routers times the
    number of VPNs or BDs. However, the number of labels can be greatly reduced if
    the association between a label and a VPN or BD is made by provisioning, so that
    all ingress routers assign the same label to a particular VPN or BD. New procedures
    are needed in order to take advantage of such provisioned labels. This document
    updates RFCs 6514 and 7432 by specifying the necessary procedures. These new procedures
    also apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels.</p>"
