abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support the
    construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and receivers are
    located in different Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) sites. These attributes
    allow the receiver site to select between unicast and multicast underlying transport,
    to convey the RLOC (Routing Locator) address of the receiver ETR (Egress Tunnel
    Router) to the control plane of the root ITR (Ingress Tunnel Router) and to signal
    the underlay multicast group to the control plane of the root ITR. This document
    updates RFC 8059 and RFC 9798.</p>"
