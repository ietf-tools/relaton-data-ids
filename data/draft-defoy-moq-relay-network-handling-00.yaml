abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension used to convey information about
    media frames, that is used for specific handling by network nodes, including error
    recovery and congestion handling. These functions can be critical to improve energy
    efficiency and network capacity in some (especially wireless) networks. Due to
    the end-to-end encryption performed in MOQ, MOQ relays are expected to implement
    these functions, and unencrypted metadata will be exposed to MOQ relays. Since
    we are in the early stages of MOQ protocol design, this document initially proposes
    base protocol requirements.</p>"
