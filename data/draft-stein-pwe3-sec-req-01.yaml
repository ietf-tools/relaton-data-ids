abstract:
- content: "<p>To date IETF's security suite has been entirely IP-centric, IPsec only
    being applicable to IP packets. This document addresses security requirements
    for MPLS pseudowires. We investigate security considerations arising from the
    PWE3 architecture, and discuss example threats, authentication, and confidentiality.</p>"
