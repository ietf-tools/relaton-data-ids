abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
    (L2TP) for enhanced support of link-specific Point to Point Protocol (PPP) options.
    PPP endpoints typically have direct access to the common physical media connecting
    them and thus have detailed knowledge about the media that is in use. When the
    L2TP is used, the two PPP peers are no longer directly connected over the same
    physical media. Instead, L2TP inserts a virtual connection over some or all of
    the PPP connection by tunneling PPP frames over a packet switched network such
    as IP. Under some conditions, an L2TP endpoint may need to negotiate PPP Link
    Control Protocol (LCP) options at a location which may not have access to all
    of the media information necessary for proper participation in the LCP negotiation.
    This document provides a mechanism for communicating desired LCP options between
    L2TP endpoints in advance of PPP LCP negotiation at the far end of an L2TP tunnel,
    as well as a mechanism for communicating the negotiated LCP options back to where
    the native PPP link resides. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
