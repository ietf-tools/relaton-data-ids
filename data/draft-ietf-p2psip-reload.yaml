abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer
    (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2P signaling protocol provides
    its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating
    peers that form the overlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session
    Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications
    with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the kinds of data
    that must be stored for a particular application. RELOAD defines a security model
    based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities. NAT
    traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol. RELOAD also allows access
    from "client" nodes which do not need to route traffic or store data for others.</p>
