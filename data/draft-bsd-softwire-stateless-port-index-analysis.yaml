abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes various algorithm proposals for building port
    sets. These algorithms are used to encode the range of ports in an IPv6 address
    and prefix in the context of stateless solutions. The ultimate goal of this analysis
    is to converge on one or a set of algorithms to be used by all stateless solutions.
    This is a companion document to [I-D.boucadair-softwire-stateless-rfc6052-update].</p>"
