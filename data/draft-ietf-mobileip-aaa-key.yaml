abstract:
- content: "<p>AAA servers, such as RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within the Internet
    today to provide authentication and authorization services for dial-up computers.
    Mobile IP requires strong authentication between the mobile node and its home
    agent. When the mobile node shares a AAA security association with its home AAA
    server, however, it is possible to use that security association to create derived
    mobility security associations between the mobile node and its home agent, and
    again between the mobile node and the foreign agent currently offering connectivity
    to the mobile node. This document specifies extensions to Mobile IP registration
    messages that can be used to create mobility security associations between the
    mobile node and its home agent, and/or between the mobile node and a foreign agent.</p>"
