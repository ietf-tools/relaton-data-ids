abstract:
- content: "<p>In DSR, a node can generate a route reply in response to a received
    route request if it has a fresh route to the destination in its route cache. However,
    this can incur the cached route reply problem and DSR just tries to mitigate this
    problem by reducing the possibility of cached route reply collisions. This document
    describes how DSR can be extended for the resolution of the cached route reply
    problem.</p>"
