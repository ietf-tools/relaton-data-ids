- content: "<p>This document presents an alternative expression mechanism for the
    copyright status of Web resources. Specifically it employs the Platform for Internet
    Content Selection (PICS) [2] label format to associate web resources with their
    copyright and usage information. This in turn can be used by search engines, proxy
    servers, agents, clients, and users for content selection or to aid in rights
    compliance. This document employs the copy control system described in [1].</p>"
