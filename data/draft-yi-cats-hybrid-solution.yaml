abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) is a traffic engineering architecture
    that takes the dynamic changes of computing and network resources into account
    when forwarding traffic to appropriate service instances for processing. For the
    development of the current network, it is important to have a solution that meets
    different types of service requirements and can be deployed reasonably. Therefore,
    this document proposes a hybrid solution to provide differentiated and flexible
    traffic streering capabilities for different service while saving the cost of
    retrofitting existing network equipment.</p>"
