abstract:
- content: "<p>The MULTIMOB group has specified a base solution to support IP multicasting
    in a PMIPv6 domain [RFC6224]. In this document, an enhancement is proposed to
    the base solution to use a multicast tree mobility anchor as the topological anchor
    point for multicast traffic, while the MAG remains as an IGMP/MLD proxy. This
    enhancement provides benefits such as reducing multicast traffic replication and
    supporting different PMIPv6 deployments scenarios.</p>"
