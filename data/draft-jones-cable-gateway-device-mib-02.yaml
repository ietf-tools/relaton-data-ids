abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of CableHome
    compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home routers. This memo specifies a MIB module
    in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set of objects
    is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards. This memo is
    a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force.
    Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing
    list at ipcdn@ietf.org and/or the editor.</p>"
