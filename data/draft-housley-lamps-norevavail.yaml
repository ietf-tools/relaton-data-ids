abstract:
- content: "<p>Short-lived X.509v3 public key certificates as profiled in RFC 5280
    are seeing greater use in the Internet. The Certification Authority (CA) that
    issues these short-lived certificates do not publish revocation information because
    the certificate lifespan that is shorter than the time needed to detect, report,
    and distribute revocation information. This specification defines the noRevAvail
    certificate extension so that a relying party can readily determine that the CA
    does not publish revocation information for the certificate.</p>"
