abstract:
- content: "<p>Services such as content distribution, distributed databases, or inter-data
    center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the operation of networks.
    They need on-demand and application-specific reservation of network connectivity,
    reliability, and resources (such as bandwidth) in a variety of network applications
    (such as point-to- point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile back-haul)
    and in a range of network technologies from packet (IP/MPLS) down to optical.
    An environment that operates to meet this type of requirement is said to have
    Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO). ABNO brings together many existing
    technologies for gathering information about the resources available in a network,
    for consideration of topologies and how those topologies map to underlying network
    resources, for requesting path computation, and for provisioning or reserving
    network resources. Thus, ABNO may be seen as the use of a toolbox of existing
    components enhanced with a few new elements. The key component within an ABNO
    is the Path Computation Element (PCE), which can be used for computing paths and
    is further extended to provide policy enforcement capabilities for ABNO. This
    document describes an architecture and framework for ABNO showing how these components
    fit together. It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture
    and meet the needs of the applications.</p>"
