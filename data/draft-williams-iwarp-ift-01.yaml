abstract:
- content: "<p>A framing protocol is defined for DDP over TCP that is fully compliant
    with applicable TCP RFCs and fully interoperable with existing TCP implementations.
    This protocol is being offered as an alternative to to the proposal offered in
    [MPA]. The protocol offers to two things, definition of the DDP record boundaries
    within the TCP stream, and added data integrity by means of added CRC protection.</p>"
