abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Protocol Independent Multicast
    (PIM) multicast routing protocol that enables PIM proxying from PIM domains toward
    other multicast domains. It relies on PIM Proxies located on domain borders and
    Proxy Controllers which can be located anywhere. This document describes how subscriptions
    can be proxied toward domain's border interfaces using MLDv2 and IGMPv3, but other
    protocols could be used as well. Once multicast traffic is received on a proxied
    interface, it can be forwarded as if originated by a directly connected source.</p>"
