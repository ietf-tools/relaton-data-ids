abstract:
- content: '<p>This draft describes a suite of port-based Provider-provisioned VPN
    services called Generalized VPNs (GVPNs) that uses BGP as a VPN auto-discovery
    and GMPLS as a signaling mechanism. GVPN services are "generalized" as the interfaces
    on the customer’s and provider ports could be any of the interfaces supported
    by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS). GVPN services outlined in this document are: (1)
    a port-based Generalized Virtual Private Wire (GVPW) where the basic unit of service
    is a Label Switched Path (LSP) between a pair of customer’s ports within a given
    VPN port-topology. (2) a Generalized Virtual Private Cross-connect (GVPXC) service
    where the service provider network appears to the customer network as a GMPLS-enabled
    Virtual Private node. A GVPXC service provides flexible traffic engineering on
    the client network and eliminates the need for n square routing peering between
    CEs. Since GVPNs uses GMPLS as the signaling mechanism, and since GMPLS applies
    to both TDM and Optical interfaces, it results that GVPN services include Optical/TDM
    VPNs (though they need not be restricted to).</p>'
