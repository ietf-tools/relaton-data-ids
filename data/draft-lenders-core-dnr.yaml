abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies solutions to discover DNS resolvers that support
    encrypted DNS resolution in constrained environments. The discovery is based DNS
    SVCB records, Router Advertisements, or DHCP. In particular, the proposed specification
    allows a host to learn DNS over CoAP (DoC) servers, including configurations to
    use DoC over TLS/DTLS, OSCORE, and EDHOC when resolving names.</p>"
