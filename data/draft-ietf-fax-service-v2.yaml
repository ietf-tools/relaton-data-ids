abstract:
- content: <p>This specification provides for "simple mode" carriage of facsimile
    data using Internet mail. Extensions to this document will follow. The current
    specification employs standard protocols and file formats such as TCP/IP, Internet
    mail protocols, Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), and Tagged Image
    File Format (TIFF) for Facsimile. It can send images not only to other Internet-aware
    facsimile devices but also to Internet-native systems, such as PCs with common
    email readers which can handle MIME mail and TIFF for Facsimile data. The specification
    facilitates communication among existing facsimile devices, Internet mail agents,
    and the gateways which connect them. This document is a revision of RFC 2305.
    There have been no technical changes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
