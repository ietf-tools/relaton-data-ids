abstract:
- content: "<p>In MIPv6 specification, there are two basic methods for mobile multicast:
    1) via a bi-directional tunnel from MN to its Home Agent;2) via a local multicast
    router on the foreign link being visited. In this memo, a hybrid method is introduced.
    MN subscribes multicast service through Home agent at first. Then, MN changes
    its subscription router to a local multicast router which can provide the same
    multicast service.</p>"
