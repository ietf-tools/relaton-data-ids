abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7891] Section 7 defines the handling principles for PIM Join attributes
    with same type of RFF Vector and Explicit RFP Vector, but with different contents
    are received. However, it does not address scenarios where one downstream router
    includes a RFF Vector in its message while another does not. This leaves the handling
    of such conflicts unspecified. This document supplements the existing specifications
    by defining the processing rules for this specific conflict scenario.</p>"
