abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for a client or resource server utilizing
    an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] authorization server when responding to a Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] GET request with the Observe option [I-D.ietf-core-observe].
    CoAP's Observe option has the potential to reduce network traffic by allowing
    clients to get updates on protected resources as the protected resource's values
    change rather than polling the protected resource periodically. A client adding
    the Observe option to a CoAP GET request has the greatest impact on the device
    providing the protected resource since the resource server (RS) has to maintain
    a list of requestors and deal with tokens associated with those requests. Additionally
    an Authorization Server (AS) could potentially allow token introspection to happen
    over a GET request with the Observe option, further reducing network usage and
    heavy lifting on the part of the resource server doing the introspection.</p>"
