abstract:
- content: "<p>Lemonade server to client notifications provides some extensions to
    the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for optimization in a mobile setting, aimed
    at delivering extended functionality for mobile devices with limited resources.
    These notifications support pushing crucial changes actively to a client, rather
    than requiring the client to initiate contact to ask for state changes.</p>"
