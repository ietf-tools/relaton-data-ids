abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposed update for the usage of the Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to protect user messages sent over the
    Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). DTLS over SCTP provides mutual authentication,
    confidentiality, integrity protection, and replay protection for applications
    that use SCTP as their transport protocol and allows client/server applications
    to communicate in a way that is designed to give communications privacy and to
    prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery. Applications using
    DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport features provided by SCTP and its
    extensions. This document intends to obsolete RFC 6083 and removes the 16 kB limitation
    on user message size by defining a secure user message fragmentation so that multiple
    DTLS records can be used to protect a single user message. It further updates
    the DTLS versions to use, as well as the HMAC algorithms for SCTP-AUTH, and simplifies
    the implementation by some stricter requirements on the establishment procedures.</p>"
