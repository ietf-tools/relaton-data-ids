abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can
    carry any data payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to
    provision new service with any expense. In a scaled MPLS RSVP router during MBB/Global
    repair, router needs to program large number of labels into PFE. This operation
    results in lot of label re-computation and label programming. This draft is proposing
    a solution to label reusage</p>"
