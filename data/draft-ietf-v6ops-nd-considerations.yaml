abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a key protocol of IPv6 first-hop. ND uses
    multicast extensively and trusts all hosts. In some scenarios like wireless networks,
    multicast can be inefficient. In other scenarios like public access networks,
    hosts may not be trustable. Consequently, ND has potential issues in various scenarios.
    The issues and the solutions for them are documented in more than 30 RFCs. It
    is difficult to keep track of all these issues and solutions. Therefore, an overview
    is useful. This document firstly summarizes the known ND issues and optimization
    solutions into a one-stop reference. Analyzing these solutions reveals an insight:
    isolating hosts is effective in preventing ND issues. Five isolation methods are
    proposed and their applicability is discussed. Guidelines are described for selecting
    a suitable isolation method based on the deployment scenario. When ND issues are
    prevented with a proper isolation method, the solutions for these issues are not
    needed. This simplifies the IPv6 first- hops.</p>"
