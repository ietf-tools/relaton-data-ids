abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes structures within a QuickTime movie file which
    permit easy transmission of the media content over RTP. This specification is
    intended to assist those who wish to stream stored movies over RTP, those wishing
    to prepare movies for streaming, and for those who might wish to record into QuickTime
    while preserving RTP information. The bit-stream(s) of RTP packets are normally
    compliant with the RTP payload definitions for their content, and full inter-operability
    can be achieved. Each QuickTime media track within a movie is sent over a separate
    RTP session and synchronized using standard RTP techniques. This specification
    builds on the published QuickTime file format specification.</p>"
