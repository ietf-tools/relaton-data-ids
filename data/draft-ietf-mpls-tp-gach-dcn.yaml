abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) has been defined as a generalization
    of the pseudowire (PW) associated control channel to enable the realization of
    a control/communication channel that is associated with Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs), MPLS PWs, MPLS LSP segments, and MPLS sections
    between adjacent MPLS-capable devices. The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is
    a profile of the MPLS architecture that identifies elements of the MPLS toolkit
    that may be combined to build a carrier-grade packet transport network based on
    MPLS packet switching technology. This document describes how the G-ACh may be
    used to provide the infrastructure that forms part of the Management Communication
    Network (MCN) and a Signaling Communication Network (SCN). Collectively, the MCN
    and SCN may be referred to as the Data Communication Network (DCN). This document
    explains how MCN and SCN messages are encapsulated, carried on the G-ACh, and
    demultiplexed for delivery to the management or signaling/routing control plane
    components on an MPLS-TP node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
