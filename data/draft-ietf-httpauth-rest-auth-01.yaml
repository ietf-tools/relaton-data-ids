abstract:
- content: '<p>This document proposes a "RESTful" pattern of authentication for HTTP/1.0,
    1.1, and 2.0. The goal is to make it easy to add authentication mechanisms to
    HTTP applications and to make it easy to implement them even without much help
    from the HTTP stack (though it is best to integrate authentication into the stack,
    of course). Another goal is to make it easy to reuse existing authentication mechanisms
    by allowing the user (that is, the server''s operators) to choose what concrete
    authentication mechanism(s) to use. Among other benefits of RESTauth: it is orthogonal
    to "HTTP routers" and proxies, it results in session Uniform Resource Identifiers
    (URIs) that can be DELETEd to logout, naturally supports multi-legged authentication
    schemes, naturally supports clustering, and can be universally implemented on
    the server side with such server&lt;-&gt;application interfaces as the Common
    Gateway Interface (CGI) and FastCGI, among others.</p>'
