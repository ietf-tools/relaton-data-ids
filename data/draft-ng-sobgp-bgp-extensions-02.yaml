abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systems
    within the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway Protocol [BGP],
    which is used to provide routing information between autonomous systems. This
    document proposes a system where the origin of any advertisement within BGP can
    be verified and authenticated, preventing the advertisement of prefix blocks by
    unauthorized networks, and verifying that the final destination in the path is
    actually within the autonomous system to which the packets are being routed.</p>"
