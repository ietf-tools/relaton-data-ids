abstract:
- content: "<p>Conference servers have many controls that change how the media is
    combined for the various conference participants. It is necessary to describe
    these controls to the clients connected to a centralized conference, so that the
    clients can render a user interface and allow the user to manipulate them. This
    work is being discussed on the xcon@ietf.org mailing list. This draft has not
    changed since the 02 version.</p>"
