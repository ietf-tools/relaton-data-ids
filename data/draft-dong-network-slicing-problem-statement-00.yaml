abstract:
- content: <p>The research and standardization of IMT-2020 (a.k.a. 5G) are in progress
    in several industry communities and standard organizations. The goal of 5G is
    to integrate various services, each of which has a set of unique requirements,
    into a single network, such that each service has a customized network suited
    to its needs. The concept "Network Slicing" is widely discussed and considered
    as the key mechanism to meet the diverse service requirements concurrently with
    the same physical network infrastructure. This document provides an overview of
    the concept "network slicing" in the current IMT-2020 (a.k.a. 5G) related works,
    and discusses the corresponding requirements on IP/MPLS network, which will be
    used as the mobile transport network for 5G.</p>
