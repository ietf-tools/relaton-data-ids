abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of DNS for storage of E.164 numbers.
    More specifically, how DNS can be used for identifying available services connected
    to one E.164 number. Routing of the actual connection using the service selected
    using these methods is not discussed. Discussion on this Internet-Draft is to
    be held on the mailing list ietf-e164-dns@imc.org, which is hosted by the Internet
    Mail Consortium. To subscribe, send an email to ietf-e164-dns-request@imc.org,
