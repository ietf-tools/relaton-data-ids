abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the problem statement, scope, and protocol requirements
    between the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) reference model.
    NEA provides owners of networks (e.g., an enterprise offering remote access) a
    mechanism to evaluate the posture of a system. This may take place during the
    request for network access and/or subsequently at any time while connected to
    the network. The learned posture information can then be applied to a variety
    of compliance-oriented decisions. The posture information is frequently useful
    for detecting systems that are lacking or have out-of-date security protection
    mechanisms such as: anti-virus and host-based firewall software. In order to provide
    context for the requirements, a reference model and terminology are introduced.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
