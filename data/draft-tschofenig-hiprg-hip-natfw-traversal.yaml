abstract:
- content: <p>The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is a signaling protocol, which supports
    mobility and multihoming by adding a new layer in the TCP/IP stack. By carring
    relevant parameters in the signaling messages, HIP can be used to establish IPsec
    encapsulating security payload (ESP) security associations between two hosts.
    Middleboxes (e.g. firewalls and network address translators) cannot inspect transport
    layer headers of data traffic if that traffic is sent over an IPsec ESP tunnel.
    However, HIP is designed to be middlebox friendly; it enables the middleboxes
    to inspect the signaling messages. The information that they can derive from that
    messages enables the middleboxes to uniquely identify the subsequent data flows,
    e.g. for the purposes of multiplexing and demultiplexing . A middlebox that implements
    the relevant mechanisms is called "HIP-aware". This document presents a problem
    statement and lists some requirements that are necessary for a HIP-aware middlebox
    traversal technique. These include authentication and authorization of signaling
    end-hosts by the middleboxes. Such authorization will help the middleboxes to
    decide whether or not an end host is allowed to traverse, and can potentially
    limit unwanted traffic.</p>
