abstract:
- content: "<p>The Sieve [SIEVE] language provides a very useful interoperable syntax
    for mail filtering. The Email Account Dataset Class [ACAP-EMAIL] provides an extensible
    and interoperable means of accessing and controlling Sieve scripts, but requires
    an ACAP [ACAP] server. This memo proposes a profile of ACAP which is suitable
    for accessing Sieve scripts, very easy to implement in clients and servers, and
    upwardly compatible with ACAP.</p>"
