abstract:
- content: "<p>Work on extensions to IP control protocols for reuse in the control
    plane of optical transport networks has now been underway for around a year in
    the MPLS and IPO groups. Recent discussions have however highlighted a lack of
    defined requirements that should be met by candidate protocols being considered
    for the optical control plane. Indeed, there have been several requests for carriers
    to submit their requirements. This draft provides one view of some (but by no
    means all) of these requirements. A protocol independent approach is taken, and
    the authors recommend that the design of any particular facet of an optical control
    plane should take into account the considerations made in this document.</p>"
