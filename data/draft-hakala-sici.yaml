abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how Serial Item and Contribution Identifiers
    (SICIs; persistent and unique identifiers for serial issues and contributions
    such as articles) can be supported within the URN framework and the syntax for
    URNs defined in RFC 2141 [Moats]. Much of the discussion below is based on the
    ideas expressed in RFC 2288 [Lynch]. Chapter 5 contains a URN namespace registration
    request modelled according to the template in RFC 2611 [Daigle et al.].</p>"
