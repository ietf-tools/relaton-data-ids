abstract:
- content: "<p>An Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined
    in RFC8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone storing VPN communications
    today and decrypting it later, when (and if) cryptographically relevant quantum
    computers are available. The protection is achieved by means of Post-quantum Preshared
    Key (PPK) which is mixed into the session keys calculation. However, this protection
    doesn't cover an initial IKEv2 SA, which might be unacceptable in some scenarios.
    This specification defines an alternative way to get protection against quantum
    computers, which is similar to the solution defined in RFC8784, but protects the
    initial IKEv2 SA too. Besides, RFC8784 assumes that PPKs are static and thus they
    are only used when an initial IKEv2 Security Association (SA) is created. If a
    fresh PPK is available before the IKE SA is expired, then the only way to use
    it is to delete the current IKE SA and create a new one from scratch, which is
    inefficient. This specification also defines a way to use PPKs in active IKEv2
    SA for creating additional IPsec SAs and for rekeys operations.</p>"
