abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains why it is preferable to have multiple media
    sources encoded in SDP as one m= section rather than many m= sections, especially
    when there are a large number of video sources which change frequently and need
    dynamic resolution changes, such as in a video conferencing system.</p>"
