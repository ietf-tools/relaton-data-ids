abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the shared mesh protection concept. Its aim
    is to provide fast, guaranteed recovery of service at significantly less cost
    of protection capacity compared to other schemes. In companion documents [1,2],
    extensions to RSVP-TE and OSPF-TE protocols are proposed that enable shared mesh
    protection. Those extensions, together with this document, first address global
    repair with path-based protection switching, as opposed to local repair of LSP
    failures and reroute. However, the concept can be extended straightforwardly to
    the local repair techniques being considered in the MPLS working group.</p>"
