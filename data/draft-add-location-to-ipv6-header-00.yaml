abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IP-LOC, a proposed extension which suggests
    adding GPS coordinates to IPv6 header. The current method of determining location
    of IP traffic is through IP address registration database, which is not very accurate
    as it depends on how the ISP registers its IP subnets, that is normally done in
    a country/city format. It also assumes that in the future, GPS capability will
    be added to the router itself (just like smart phones) and packet marking and
    classification based on geo-location will be required. QoS, firewall and routing
    based on geo-location will be highly required when mobile routers move from one
    geo-location to another which has different policy.</p>"
