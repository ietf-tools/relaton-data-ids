abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture where peers in an peer-to-
    peer overlay use special IP addresses to identify other peers. Two of the advantages
    of this approach are that (a) most existing applications can run in an overlay
    without needing any changes and (b) peer mobility and NAT traversal are handled
    in a way that is transparent to most applications.</p>"
