abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol enables a mobile
    network to change its point of attachment and keeps nodes in the mobile network
    reachable when the mobile network moves in the Internet. However, using the NEMO
    Basic Support protocol, all traffic must pass through the bi-directional tunnel
    between a mobile router and its home agent when the mobile router leaves its home
    network. The bi-directional tunnel results in sub-optimal routing and long transmission
    delay. This document describes the SIP-based Network Mobility (SIP-NEMO) Route
    Optimization (RO) that achieves optimal routing and reduces the limitation induced
    by Mobile IPv6.</p>"
