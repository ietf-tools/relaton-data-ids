abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a service of providing a hint score of name-ip
    validation by whois servers. The whois servers will receive requests to provide
    a hint on degree of associativity between given name and IP pairs. This service
    may be used to acertain that the host a client intends to communicate with is
    indeed the host the client expects it to be. While establishing secure sessions,
    this service may also be used on top of certificate validation to detect any possibility
    of a trusted CA's issuing a fake certificate for the server in question.</p>"
