abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft considers efficient key management for encrypted
    multicast traffic in large groups, where the group size and dynamics have a significant
    impact on the network load. We consider the life cycle key management costs of
    a multicast connection, and show for a Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) how member
    pre-registration and periodic admission reduces the initialization cost, and how
    the optimum outdegree of a hierarchical tree varies with the expected member volatility
    and rekey factor.</p>"
