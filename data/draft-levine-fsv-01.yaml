abstract:
- content: "<p>Flexible Sender Validation (FSV) is a lightweight validation technique
    to detect and deter some kinds of e-mail address forgery. It publishes information
    in the DNS about IP addresses authorized to send mail for a domain, one in a family
    of IP based mail validation proposals dating back to Paul Vixie's original in
    2002[5]. FSV uses redundant copies of IP data to permit both efficient use by
    very high-volume mail servers, and simple implementation on low to moderate volume
    mail servers.</p>"
