abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP servers
    to provision with DHCP clients specific security configuration information. It
    has been known that DHCP protocol typically works at the very beginning stage
    of the access to networks, thus lack of security protection. However, although
    it is difficult to set up some security mechanism for DHCP protocol solely, it
    is able to play a key role for DHCP server to provide configuration information
    to help building security mechanism within those pre-configured DHCP clients and
    devices. This new option defines a simple extension to current standard format
    and benefits to those who need to activate security mechanism in an early stage
    and interoperate within devices from multiple vendors.</p>"
