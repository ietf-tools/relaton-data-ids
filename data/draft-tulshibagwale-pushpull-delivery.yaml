abstract:
- content: <p>In situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens (SETs) to
    a network peer is also a receiver of SETs from the same peer, it is helpful to
    have an efficient way of sending an receiving SETs in one HTTP transaction. Using
    current mechanisms such as "Push-Based Delivery of Security Event Tokens (SETs)
    Using HTTP" or "Poll-Based Delivery of Security Event Tokens (SETs) Using HTTP"
    both require two or more HTTP connections to exchange SETs between peers. In many
    cases, such as when using the OpenID Shared Signals Framework (SSF), the situation
    where each entity is both a transmitter and receiver is getting increasingly common.
    In addition, this specification enables the transmission and reception of multiple
    SETs in one HTTP connection.</p>
