abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this FYI memo is to provide practical information to site
    administrators and network managers. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community. It does not specify any standard. It is not a statement of IAB policy
    or recommendations. [Also FYI 2.] This catalog contains descriptions of several
    tools available to assist network managers in debugging and maintaining TCP/IP
    internets and interconnected communications resources. Entries in the catalog
    tell what a tool does, how it works, and how it can be obtained.</p>"
