abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies mechanisms for automatically decaying OSPFv2 [1]
    metrics and priorities in the event of partial, but critical, system failures
    (errors) which do not cause interfaces to change state (i.e. they are opaque to
    transient to data). The mechanisms defined in this document, called metric auto-decay,
    allow operators to configure OSPFv2 networks to gracefully bypass devices which
    have incurred these opaque system errors.</p>"
