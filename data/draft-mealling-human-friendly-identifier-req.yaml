- content: "<p>This document includes a set of requirements for an identifier that
    is engineered for human consumption. While the identifier is still machine consumable,
    the services and capabilities of the underlying system are designed with humans
    in mind. This includes concepts of geographic and context specific constraints,
    non-uniqueness, and natural language match semantics.</p>"
