abstract:
- content: "<p>This Recommendation describes the Multimedia Management Information
    Base for H.323 and H.320 Multimedia Terminals. The purpose of HMultimediaMIB is
    to standardize the management information in multimedia conferencing systems based
    on one of more of the ITU-T H-series recommendations. The goal of Multimedia Management
    is to provide the appropriate level of management support for the particular Multimedia
    device. Multimedia management must permit the resources that are being used by
    individual Multimedia sessions to be identified for the purposes of fault detection,
    fault isolation, performance monitoring, configuration management, and capacity
    analyses. Multimedia management is applicable to both intermediate-system as well
    as end-system Multimedia devices such as terminals, multipoint control units (MCUs),
    gatekeepers, and gateways.</p>"
