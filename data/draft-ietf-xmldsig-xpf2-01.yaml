abstract:
- content: "<p>XML Signature recommends a standard means for specifying information
    content to be digitally signed and for representing the resulting digital signatures
    in XML. Some applications require the ability to specify a subset of a given XML
    document as the information content to be signed. The XML Signature specification
    meets this requirement with the XPath transform. However, this transform can be
    difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies. This specification
    defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the development of efficient
    document subsetting implementations that interoperate under similar performance
    profiles. This document is the W3C XML Signature XPath-Filter 2.0 Recommendation.
    This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested parties and
    has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document
    and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another
    document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the
    specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality
    and interoperability of the Web.</p>"
