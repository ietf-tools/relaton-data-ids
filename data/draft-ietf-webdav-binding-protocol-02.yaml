abstract:
- content: "<p>This is one of a pair of specifications that extend the WebDAV Distributed
    Authoring Protocol to enable clients to create new access paths to existing resources.
    The two protocol extensions have very different characteristics that make them
    useful for different sorts of applications. The present specification defines
    bindings, and the BIND method for creating them. Creating a new binding to a resource
    indirectly creates one or more new URIs mapped to that resource, which can then
    be used to access it. Servers are required to insure the integrity of any bindings
    that they allow to be created. The related specification, RFC xxxx, defines redirect
    reference resources. A redirect reference resource is a resource whose default
    response is an HTTP/1.1 302 (Found) status code, redirecting the client to a different
    resource, the target resource. A redirect reference makes it possible to access
    the target resource indirectly, through any URI mapped to the redirect reference
    resource. There are no integrity guarantees associated with redirect reference
    resources.</p>"
