- content: <p>This document describes the Scalable Streaming Raster Graphics (SSRG)
    specification for the modern Web. An unfortunate truth of the modern internet
    is that digital equity has been secondary to the expansion of broadband in the
    most developed areas of the world. This in turn makes it much harder for developing
    nations to gain a competitive foothold in the digital market due to lackluster
    download speeds limiting access to content-rich applications and educational resources.
    The SSRG specification, dubbed "Surge" by its creator, intends to bridge "The
    Digital Divide" using techniques of classical quadtree image compression and Laplacian
    image pyramids to create a more scalable and equitable browsing experience for
    low-bandwidth users while still providing standard features such as perceptually
    lossless image quality at competitive compression rates. The format efficiently
    encodes a multi-resolution version of the stored image that can be streamed sequentially
    in order of increasing pixel resolution using conventional mechanisms of the HTTP
    protocol. The specification comes in three main parts:</p>
