abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC5575) describes the distribution
    of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are distributed via
    BGP to BGP peers to support the following 3 applications: (1) mitigation of Denial
    of Service (DoS), (2) traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNs, and (3) centralized
    traffic control for networks with SDN or NFV controllers. A BGP Flow Filter that
    combines packet filter with time may provide an ability to for these three applications
    to have a flow filter operate for only a specific time. This document proposes
    a new BGP Flow specification filter based on time.</p>"
