abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol
    that serves for transmitting IP Traffic Flow information over the network. In
    order to transmit IP Traffic Flow information from an Exporting Process to an
    information Collecting Process, a common representation of flow data and a standard
    means of communicating them is required. This document describes how the IPFIX
    Data and Template Records are carried over a number of transport protocols from
    an IPFIX Exporting Process to an IPFIX Collecting Process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
