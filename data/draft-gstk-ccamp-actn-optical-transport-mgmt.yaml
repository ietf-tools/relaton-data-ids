abstract:
- content: "<p>Many network technologies are operated as Traffic Engineered (TE) networks.
    Optical networks are a particular TE example, with many technology-specific details.
    Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) is a management architecture that
    abstracts TE network resources to provide a limited network view for customers
    to request and self-manage connectivity services. It also provides functional
    components to orchestrate and operate the network. However, ACTN does not include
    consideration of Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security aspects
    of management (known as FCAPS). Nevertheless, FCAPS forms a critical part of service
    assurance for network operations. This document introduces FCAPS into the ACTN
    architecture as applied to optical networks. It considers what elements of existing
    IETF YANG work can be used and what new work is needed.</p>"
