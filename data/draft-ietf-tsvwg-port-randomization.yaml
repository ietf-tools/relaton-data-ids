abstract:
- content: <p>During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number
    of "blind" attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP) and similar protocols. The consequences of these attacks range from throughput
    reduction to broken connections or data corruption. These attacks rely on the
    attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address,
    Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport
    protocol instance to be attacked. This document describes a number of simple and
    efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the possibility
    of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced. While this is not a replacement
    for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol instance, the
    aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security with very little
    effort and without any key management overhead. The algorithms described in this
    document are local policies that may be incrementally deployed and that do not
    violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that may benefit
    from them, such as TCP, UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),
    Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided that the RTP application
    explicitly signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers). This memo documents an Internet
    Best Current Practice.</p>
