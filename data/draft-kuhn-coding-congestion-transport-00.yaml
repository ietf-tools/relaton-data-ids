abstract:
- content: "<p>There are discussions on how loss-based congestion controls consider
    lost packets that have been recovered by a coding mechanism. This document analyses
    to what extent transport protocols could ignore such signals and proposes best
    current practices on the interaction between congestion control and coding mechanism
    at the transport layer. Coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of the document.
    Examples of interest for the proposed solution is to better deal with tail losses
    or with networks with non-congestion losses.</p>"
