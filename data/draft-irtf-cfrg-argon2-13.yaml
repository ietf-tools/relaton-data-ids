abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Argon2 memory-hard function for password
    hashing and proof-of-work applications. We provide an implementer-oriented description
    with test vectors. The purpose is to simplify adoption of Argon2 for Internet
    protocols. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)
    in the IRTF.</p>"
