abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies use of the BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)
    protocol in RBridge campuses based on the OAM (Operations, Administration, and
    Maintenance) Channel extension to the TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots
    of Links) protocol. BFD is a widely deployed OAM mechanism in IP and MPLS networks.
    However, in the present form a BFD packet cannot be sent over a TRILL network
    as it is either IP/ UDP encapsulated or encapsulated directly over MPLS or using
    ACH encapsulation. This document also defines BFD encapsulation over TRILL to
    address this shortcoming.</p>"
