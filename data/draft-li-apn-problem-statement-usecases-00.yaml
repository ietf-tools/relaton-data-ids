abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better network
    services for users. As the ever developing 5G and industrial verticals evolve,
    more and more services that have diverse network requirements such as ultra-low
    latency and high reliability are emerging, and therefore differentiated service
    treatment is desired by users. However, network operators are typically unaware
    of which applications are traversing their network infrastructure, which means
    that only coarse-grained services can be provided to users. As a result, network
    operators are only evolving their infrastructure to be large but dumb pipes without
    corresponding revenue increases that might be enabled by differentiated service
    treatment. As network technologies evolve including deployments of IPv6, SRv6,
    Segment Routing over MPLS dataplane, the programmability provided by IPv6 and
    Segment Routing can be augmented by conveying application related information
    into the network. Adding application knowledge to the network layer allows applications
    to specify finer granularity requirements to the network operator. This document
    analyzes the existing problems caused by lack of application awareness, and outlines
    various use cases that could benefit from an Application-aware Networking (APN)
    architecture.</p>"
