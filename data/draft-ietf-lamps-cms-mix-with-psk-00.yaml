abstract:
- content: "<p>The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious
    challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed today. The
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport and key agreement algorithms
    that could be broken by the invention of such a quantum computer. By storing communications
    that are protected with the CMS today, someone could decrypt them in the future
    when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available. Once quantum-secure key
    management algorithms are available, the CMS will be extended to support them,
    if existing syntax the does not accommodated them. In the near-term, this document
    describes a mechanism to protect today's communication from the future invention
    of a large-scale quantum computer by mixing the output of key transport and key
    agreement algorithms with a pre-shared key.</p>"
