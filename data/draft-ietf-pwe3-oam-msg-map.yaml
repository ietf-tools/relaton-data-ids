- content: "<p>This document specifies the mapping and notification of defect states
    between a pseudowire (PW) and the Attachment Circuits (ACs) of the end-to-end
    emulated service. It standardizes the behavior of Provider Edges (PEs) with respect
    to PW and AC defects. It addresses ATM, Frame Relay, Time Division Multiplexing
    (TDM), and Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH)
    PW services, carried over MPLS, MPLS/IP, and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version
    3/IP (L2TPv3/IP) Packet Switched Networks (PSNs). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
