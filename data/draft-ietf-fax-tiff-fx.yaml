abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a revised version of RFC 2301. The revisions, summarized
    in the list attached as Annex B, are based on discussions and suggestions for
    improvements that have been made since RFC 2301 was issued in March 1998, and
    on the results of independent implementations and interoperability testing. This
    RFC 2301 revision describes the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) representation of
    image data specified by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendations
    for black-and-white and color facsimile. This file format specification is commonly
    known as TIFF for Fax eXtended (TIFF-FX). It formally defines minimal, extended,
    and lossless Joint Bi-level Image experts Group (JBIG) profiles (Profiles S, F,
    J) for black-and-white fax and base JPEG, lossless JBIG, and Mixed Raster Content
    profiles (Profiles C, L, M) for color and grayscale fax. These profiles correspond
    to the content of the applicable ITU-T Recommendations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
