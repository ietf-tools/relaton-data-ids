abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the format of the data returned by a Time Stamp
    Authority and the protocols to be used when communicating with it. The time stamping
    service can be used as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) as one component in building
    reliable non-repudiation services (see [ISONR]). In order to reduce the amount
    of trust required of a TSA we introduce (in Appendix C) the optional Temporal
    Data Authority (TDA) whose function is to provide further corroborating evidence
    of the time contained in the token. We also give an example of how to place a
    signature at a particular point in time, from which the appropriate certificate
    status information (e.g. CRLs) may be checked.</p>"
