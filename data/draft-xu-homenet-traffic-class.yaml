abstract:
- content: "<p>Home IT staff is generally unfamiliar with network operations, making
    it desirable to provide a configuration-free mode of operation. Policy-based routing
    (in the sense of configuring one router to redirect traffic to another based on
    access control) and multi- topology routing both require configuration, making
    them undesirable. In this document, we propose a configuration-free mechanism,
    in which packets will be routed towards the corresponding upstream ISPs based
    on both destination and source addresses.</p>"
