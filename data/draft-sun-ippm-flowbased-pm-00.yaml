abstract:
- content: "<p>The performance measurements of service flow are becoming significant
    important for administrators monitoring the fitness of the network. This memo
    defines an end-to-end flow-based performance measurement method, which is achieved
    by generating synthetic measurement packets, injecting them to the network and
    analyzing the statistics carried in the measurement packets.This measurement method
    can measure flow characteristics such as delay, ipdv (IP Packet Delay Variation)
    and packet loss.</p>"
