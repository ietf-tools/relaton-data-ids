abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, I provide a high-level design for a new protocol
    in the application layer of the TCP/IP suite that will build a secure tunnel between
    the user's browser and the server without the involvement of any third party.
    My proposed protocol is called User- Defined Key Pair (UDKP), and its objective
    is to build a secure tunnel between the user's browser and the server using a
    public/private key pair generated for the user on the fly inside the user's browser
    based on the user credential information. This key pair will be used by the protocol
    instead of the server certificate as the starting point for creating the secure
    tunnel.</p>"
