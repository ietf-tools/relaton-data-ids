abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a threat model for the context in which (E)BGP
    path security mechanisms will be developed. The threat model includes an analysis
    of the RPKI, and focuses on the ability of an AS to verify the authenticity of
    the AS path info received in a BGP update. We use the term PATHSEC to refer to
    any BGP path security technology that makes use of the RPKI. PATHSEC will secure
    BGP [RFC4271], consistent with the inter-AS security focus of the RPKI [RFC6480].
    The document characterizes classes of potential adversaries that are considered
    to be threats, and examines classes of attacks that might be launched against
    PATHSEC. It does not revisit attacks against unprotected BGP, as that topic has
    already been addressed in [RFC4271]. It concludes with brief discussion of residual
    vulnerabilities.</p>"
