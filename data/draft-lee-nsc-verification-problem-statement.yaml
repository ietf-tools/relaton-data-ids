abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the possible conflicts between service overlays
    in the network service chaining. These conflicts are due to overlapping in classification
    rules and resource sharing of service overlays. The verification of service chains
    provides a method for network administrators to detect such conflicts and correct
    a problematic service chain before applying it on the real network.</p>"
