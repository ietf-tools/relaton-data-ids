abstract:
- content: "<p>Typical connectivity service offerings based upon on Customer Premise
    Equipment (CPEs) involve DNS forwarders on the CPE for various reasons (offer
    local services, control the scope/content of information in DNS, ensure better
    dependability for local service, provide control to users, etc.). Upgrading DNS
    to use encrypted transports introduces deployment complications as to how to sustain
    current offerings with local services. Solutions are needed to ease operating
    DNS forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of encrypted DNS capabilities.
    This document describes the problem and to what extent existing solutions can
    or can't be used for these deployments. For example, Star certificates and name
    constraints extension suffer from the problem of deploying a new feature to CAs,
    TLS clients, and servers.</p>"
