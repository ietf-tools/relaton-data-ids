abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a specific requirement for associating SIP
    endpoints with PSTN (Public switched telephony Network) endpoints, not for the
    SIP endpoint to replace the PSTN endpoint, but to allow them to be used together.
    It outlines some potential ways of addressing this requirement and proposes one
    of the options as the best case approach. Additionally, it describes a general
    requirement that fell out from this scenario and that might be a good candidate
    for further study.</p>"
