abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft addresses applying Remote Direct Memory Access to the NFS
    protocols. NFS implementations historically incur significant overhead due to
    data copies on end-host systems, as well as other sources. The potential benefits
    of RDMA to these implementations are explored, and the reasons why RDMA is especially
    well-suited to NFS and network file protocols in general are evaluated.</p>"
