abstract:
- content: "<p>This document sets guidelines for human rights considerations for developers
    working on network protocols and architectures, similar to the work done on the
    guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973]. This is an updated version of
    the guidelines for human rights considerations in [RFC8280]. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes. This informational document has consensus for publication from the Internet
    Research Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol Considerations Research (HRPC)
    Group. It has been reviewed, tried, and tested by both by the research group as
    well as by researchers and practitioners from outside the research group (for
    example see: https://gitlab.com/hr-rt/documents). The research group acknowledges
    that the understanding of the impact of Internet protocols and architecture on
    society is a developing practice and is a body of research that is still in development.</p>"
