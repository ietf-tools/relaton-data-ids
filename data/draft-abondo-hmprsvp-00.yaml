abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a resource reservation protocol Hierarchical
    Proxy Mobile Resource Reservation Protocol (HPMRSVP). This protocol is based on
    the hierarchical architecture HMIPv6 and used a modified version of FHMIPv6 to
    handle the handover. During a session, the resource reservation between two mobile
    nodes is limited to the access network. Furthermore, when a handover occurs, resources
    are uniquely reserved to the target access point before the handover is completed.
    The proposed protocol allows to reduce delays and packet loss. In addition, management
    of refresh messages is moved to the access router, which holds the refresh reservation
    state for the duration of the session on behalf of the mobile unit. The access
    network thereby becomes responsible for upholding the session, which optimizes
    the utilization of the radio link.</p>"
