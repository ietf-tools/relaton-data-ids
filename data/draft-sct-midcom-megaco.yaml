abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the applicability of the Megaco/H.248 device control
    protocol [1] as the Middlebox communication protocol. It discusses the architectural
    similarities between Megaco and Midcom and how Megaco meets most of the key requirements
    for the Midcom protocol. Modeling the underlying Middlebox resources (such as,
    filters, policy rules etc) as separate elements from the Megaco entities allows
    the usage of the protocol as-is, satisfying some of the resource access control
    requirements. Minimal extensions in the form of new Termination/Package definition
    (without impacting the base protocol) are sought for Midcom. The Midcom protocol
    profile and other extensions/packages will be specified in a separate internet
    draft.</p>"
