abstract:
- content: "<p>Direct, real-time communications between web user agents (browsers)
    requires two points of standardization. The first describes the on- the-wire protocol
    that is used. The second is the API that controls and configures what gets put
    on the wire and how. The capabilities of the protocol determines the nature of
    the API. This document outlines how the constraints imposed upon the API by the
    protocol.</p>"
