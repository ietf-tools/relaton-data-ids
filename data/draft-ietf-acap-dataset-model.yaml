abstract:
- content: "<p>The ACAP [ACAP] Dataset Model is very extensible, and allows applications
    to easily share options and information. With this extensibility comes a complexity
    that an application designer must fully understand in order to interoperate while
    using ACAP. This document will help the reader understand and visualize the ACAP
    hierarchy, come to a better understanding of how to design and access ACAP datasets,
    and understand the relationship between attributes, entries, datasets, and dataset
    classes.</p>"
