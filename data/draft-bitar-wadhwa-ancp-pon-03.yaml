abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of Access
    Node Control Mechanism, as described in [ANCP-FRAMEWORK], to PON based broadband
    access. The need for an Access Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access
    Server (NAS) and an Access Node Complex (a combination of Optical Line Termination
    (OLT) and Optical Network Termination (ONT) elements), is described in a multi-service
    reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service- related and Subscriber-related
    operations. The Access Node Control Mechanism is also extended for interaction
    between components of the Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT). The Access Node Control
    mechanism will ensure that the transmission of the information does not need to
    go through distinct element managers but rather uses a direct device- device communication.
    This allows for performing access link related operations within those network
    elements to meet performance objectives.</p>"
