abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a list of tests for implementers of IP Flow
    Information eXport (IPFIX) compliant Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.
    This document specifies guidelines for a series of tests that can be run on the
    IPFIX Exporting Process and Collecting Process in order to probe the conformity
    and robustness of the IPFIX protocol implementations. These tests cover all important
    functions, in order to gain a level of confidence in the IPFIX implementation.
    Therefore, they allow the implementer to perform interoperability or plug tests
    with other IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
