abstract:
- content: <p>Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to licensees are available
    for non-interfering use. This available spectrum is called "White Space." Allowing
    secondary users access to available spectrum "unlocks" existing spectrum to maximize
    its utilization and to provide opportunities for innovation, resulting in greater
    overall spectrum utilization. One approach to manage spectrum sharing uses databases
    to report spectrum availability to devices. To achieve interoperability among
    multiple devices and databases, a standardized protocol must be defined and implemented.
    This document defines such a protocol, the "Protocol to Access White Space database"
    (PAWS).</p>
