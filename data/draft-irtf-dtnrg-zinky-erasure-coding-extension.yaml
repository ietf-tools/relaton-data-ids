abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Delay and Disruption Tolerant
    Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol specification [RFC5050] which describes a protocol
    that enables the transfer of relatively large Data Objects over disrupted networks.
    The Erasure Coding Extension is a mechanism that extends the ability of the existing
    DTN bundle fragmentation mechanism to handle situations where bundles have a high
    probability of being dropped. An example use case is a situation where no communication
    contact period will ever be long enough to send the whole Data Object. In this
    case the object must be partitioned into smaller chunks and these chunks are sent
    in multiple bundles. The Erasure Coding Extension provides a recovery mechanism
    that allows many of these bundles to be dropped and still allow the whole Data
    Object to be successfully sent. This document describes an Erasure Coding Extension
    Block and a framework for integrating Forward Error Correction (FEC) into the
    bundle protocol. The Erasure Coding Extension is designed to support multiple
    FEC schemes and content object types. This is the framework document for a series
    of documents about erasure coding for DTN. Companion documents describe specific
    FEC schemes [RandBinary] and specific Data Object types [EcObjects].</p>"
