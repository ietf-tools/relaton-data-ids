abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents one approach to enhance data protection when
    transmitting IPsec datagrams across the insecure networks. The method affords
    the stronger protection to the traffic by splitting it among a set of sub-tunnels.
    All the Security Associations (SAs) are set up independently for all sub-tunnels.
    Both the sending and receiving entity combine all the sub-tunnels to one clustered
    tunnel. As different sub-tunnel uses different crypto key materials and processing
    parameters, it may achieve the stronger protection of the traffic across the insecure
    networks. In addition, it could possibly bring more benefits in terms of the network
    control.</p>"
