abstract:
- content: "<p>Discovering overlay networks and the resources found within in them
    presents a number of bootstrapping problems. While those hard problems are under
    discussion, this draft proposes a small set of mechanisms which are intended to
    be generically useful for providing pointers to peer-to-peer overlay networks
    in web pages, email messages, and other textual media. While the mechanisms described
    below each meet similar needs, they are not mutually exclusive; it is expected
    that each will find some useful deployment during the early days of peer-to-peer
    overlay deployment.</p>"
