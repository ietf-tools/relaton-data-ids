abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to gives a broad picture of the existing
    proposed EAP methods, with a focus on shared key EAP methods. Indeed, it is the
    belief of the author that a standard replacement for EAP- MD5 (that is deprecated
    due to security reasons) is needed. By listing the existing shared key EAP methods,
    the goal is to gather consensus that such a multiplication of methods is detrimental
    and that a single methods retaining the best of the existing proposals could and
    should be drafted.</p>"
