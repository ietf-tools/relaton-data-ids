abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP Working Group is considering proposals to provide fast
    hand-off capabilities to the Mobile IP protocol. It is important that such proposals
    do not require usage additional bandwidth, such as required by frequent mobility
    agent advertisements. This specification allows a mobility agent to provide its
    coverage area, and the location of neighboring cells, allowing the Mobile Node
    to determine when it must initiate a hand-off.</p>"
