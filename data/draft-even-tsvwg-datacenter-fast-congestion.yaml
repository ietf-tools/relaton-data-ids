abstract:
- content: "<p>A good congestion control for data centers (DC) should provide low
    latency, fast convergence and high link utilization. Since multiple applications
    with different requirements may run on the DC network it is important to provide
    fairness between different applications that may use different congestion algorithms.
    An important issue from the user perspective is to achieve short Flow Completion
    Time (FCT). This document proposes data center congestion control direction aiming
    to achieve high performance while proving fairness.</p>"
