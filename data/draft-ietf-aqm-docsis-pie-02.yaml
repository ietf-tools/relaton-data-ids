abstract:
- content: <p>Cable modems based on Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications
    (DOCSIS) provide broadband Internet access to over one hundred million users worldwide.
    In some cases, the cable modem connection is the bottleneck (lowest speed) link
    between the customer and the Internet. As a result, the impact of buffering and
    bufferbloat in the cable modem can have a significant effect on user experience.
    The CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1 specification introduces requirements for cable modems
    to support an Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate
    the impact that buffering has on latency-sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk
    throughput performance. In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications have
    also been amended to contain similar requirements. This document describes the
    requirements on AQM that apply to DOCSIS equipment, including a description of
    the "DOCSIS-PIE" algorithm that is required on DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems.</p>
