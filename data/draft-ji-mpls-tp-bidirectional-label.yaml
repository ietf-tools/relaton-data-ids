abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new mechanism for the label allocation of
    co-routed bidirectional point-to-point paths in MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    networks, which is called the bidirectional label allocation mechanism. The nodes
    on co-routed bidirectional point-to- point paths will not need to record the label
    pairing relationship of the forward and the backward directions in this mechanism
    because the labels are symmetrical. In addition, the compression of the LIB becomes
    possible because of the existing of symmetrical elements.</p>"
