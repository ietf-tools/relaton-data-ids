    and its associated external NVE(s) to distribute the virtual machine networking
    state and the relevant attributes. One of the key attributes to be negotiated
    is VLAN ID which is the most common locally-significant tag for carrying traffic
    associated with a specific virtual network. This document provides the informational
    guides on how to configure the VLAN IDs to local networks in Split- NVE structure.</p>"
