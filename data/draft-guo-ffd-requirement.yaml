- content: "<p>The IP-based distributed system and software application layer often
    use heartbeat to maintain the network topology status. However, the heartbeat
    setting is long, which prolongs the system fault detection time. This document
    describes the requirements for a fast fault detection solution of IP-based network.</p>"
