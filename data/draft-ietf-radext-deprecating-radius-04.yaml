abstract:
- content: <p>RADIUS crypto-agility was first mandated as future work by RFC 6421.
    The outcome of that work was the publication of RADIUS over TLS (RFC 6614) and
    RADIUS over DTLS (RFC 7360) as experimental documents. Those transport protocols
    have been in wide-spread use for many years in a wide range of networks. They
    have proven their utility as replacements for the previous UDP (RFC 2865) and
    TCP (RFC 6613) transports. With that knowledge, the continued use of insecure
    transports for RADIUS has serious and negative implications for privacy and security.
    The recent publication of the "BlastRADIUS" exploit has also shown that RADIUS
    security needs to be updated. It is no longer acceptable for RADIUS to rely on
    MD5 for security. It is no longer acceptable to send device or location information
    in clear text across the wider Internet. This document therefore deprecates many
    insecure practices in RADIUS, and mandates support for secure TLS-based transport
    layers. We also discuss related security issues with RADIUS, and give recommendations
    for practices which increase both security and privacy.</p>
