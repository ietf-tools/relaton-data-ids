abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the format and semantics associated to a 'resource'
    event package that allows SIP endpoints to publish the availability of generic
    resources. A resource can be, for example, files (e.g., images, video files, audio
    files), chat rooms, streaming content, printers, printer jobs, etc. This event
    package also allows SIP endpoints to subscribe to changes in the availability
    of resources, or perform searches for the availability and location of a given
    resource. Support for partial notifications and publications is also accomplished
    by using XML patch operations.</p>"
