abstract:
- content: '<p>The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to facilitate
    the high-quality and persistent identification of information objects. A founding
    principle of the ARK is that persistence is purely a matter of service and is
    neither inherent in an object nor conferred on it by a particular naming syntax.
    The best that an identifier can do is to lead users to the services that support
    robust reference. The term ARK itself refers both to the scheme and to any single
    identifier that conforms to it. An ARK has five components: [http://NMAH/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]
    an optional and mutable Name Mapping Authority Hostport (usually a hostname),
    the "ark:" label, the Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN), the assigned Name,
    and an optional and possibly mutable Qualifier supported by the NMA. The NAAN
    and Name together form the immutable persistent identifier for the object independent
    of the URL hostname. An ARK is a special kind of URL that connects users to three
    things: the named object, its metadata, and the provider''s promise about its
    persistence. When entered into the location field of a Web browser, the ARK leads
    the user to the named object. That same ARK, inflected by appending a single question
    mark (`?''), returns a brief metadata record that is both human- and machine-
    readable. When the ARK is inflected by appending dual question marks (`??''),
    the returned metadata contains a commitment statement from the current provider.
    Tools exist for minting, binding, and resolving ARKs.</p>'
