- content: "<p>This document presents examples and inspiration for operator application
    of BGP Large Communities. Based on operational experience with BGP Communities,
    this document suggests logical categories of BGP Large Communities and demonstrates
    an orderly manner of organizing community values within them to achieve typical
    goals in routing policy. Any operator can consider using the concepts presented
    as the basis for their own BGP Large Communities repertoire.</p>"
