abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography often calls for performing
    multiple key encapsulations in parallel and then combining their outputs to derive
    a single shared secret. This document defines a comprehensible and easy to implement
    Keccak- based KEM combiner to join an arbitrary number of key shares, that is
    compatible with NIST SP 800-56Cr2 [SP800-56C] when viewed as a key derivation
    function. The combiners defined here are practical split- key PRFs and are CCA-secure
    as long as at least one of the ingredient KEMs is.</p>"
