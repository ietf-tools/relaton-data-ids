abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSPF routing protocol synchronizes its link-state database over
    all links. However, when multiple point-to-point links connect a pair of OSPF
    routers, it is only necessary to flood over one of the parallel links. This can
    be done in a backward-compatible fashion, without requiring negotiation between
    neighboring routers, as described in this memo.</p>"
