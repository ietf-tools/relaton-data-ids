abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved
    parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP. These parity codes are systematic
    codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols.
    These repair symbols are sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that
    carries the source symbols. The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes offer
    a good protection against random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at a
    cost of decent complexity. The RTP payload formats that are defined in this document
    address the scalability issues experienced with the earlier specifications including
    RFC 2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several improvements. Due to these
    changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatible with the earlier
    specifications, but endpoints that do not implement the scheme can still work
    by simply ignoring the FEC packets.</p>"
