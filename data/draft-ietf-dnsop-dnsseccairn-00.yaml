abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the operational and administrative considerations
    encountered as part of the migration from a traditional Domain Name Service (DNS)
    infrastructure to one based on DNS Security (DNSSEC). The information presented
    in this draft is based on the implementation of DNSSEC in the Collaborative Advanced
    Inter-agency Research Network (CAIRN) testbed. CAIRN is a DARPA funded testbed
    used by Government, University, and Commercial researchers to conduct Internet
    Protocol (IP) network based research. Additional information on the CAIRN testbed
    is available at http://www.cairn.net. Details on the DNSSEC implementation in
    CAIRN can be found at http://www.cairn.net/DNSSEC. It is envisioned that the information
    presented in this draft can be used as a starting reference for sites interested
    in deploying DNSSEC. It is also hoped that reporting on the experience of CAIRN
    DNSSEC implementation will provide a forum for general discussions regarding DNSSEC
    implementation.</p>"
