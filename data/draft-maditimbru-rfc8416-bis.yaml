abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global authorization
    infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet Number Resources (INRs) to make
    verifiable statements about those resources. Network operators, e.g., Internet
    Service Providers (ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate BGP route origin assertions.
    ISPs can also use the RPKI to validate the path of a BGP route. However, ISPs
    may want to establish a local view of exceptions to the RPKI data in the form
    of local filters and additions. The mechanisms described in this document provide
    a simple way to enable INR holders to establish a local, customized view of the
    RPKI, overriding global RPKI repository data as needed.</p>"
