abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents describes three subnet technologies requirements, and
    considerations. These subnets are at layer 2 of the Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET)
    protocols, which have some implications on router protocols and interfaces considerations.
    For example Packet Radio subnets (PRNETs), Low power and Lossy subnets (LLNs),
    and Satellite subnets (SNETs), have different service requirements which needs
    considerations when designing MANET routing protocols. This document also outlines
    use-case of these MANET subnets, and requirements that may be considered in MANET
    routing, for the users and designers information.</p>"
