abstract:
- content: "<p>In the past few years, as well as currently, there have and are a number
    of proposals to insert IPv6 Extension Headers into existing IPv6 packets while
    in-flight. This contradicts explicit prohibition of this type of IPv6 packet proccessing
    in the IPv6 standard. This memo describes the possible failures that can occur
    with EH insertion, the harm they can cause, and the existing model that is and
    should continue to be used to add new information to an existing IPv6 and other
    packets.</p>"
