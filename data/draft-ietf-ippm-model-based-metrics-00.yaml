abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
    if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance targets.
    This is done by subpath at a time testing -- by applying a suite of single property
    tests to successive subpaths of a long path. In many cases these single property
    tests are based on existing IPPM metrics, with the addition of success and validity
    criteria. The subpath at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers
    eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to- end path
    from meeting the users target performance. This approach makes it possible to
    to determine the IP performance requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end
    TCP performance. The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic TCP but
    are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP over the subpath under
    test. This makes the measurements open loop, eliminating nearly all of the difficulties
    encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control
    equilibrium behavior. A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable
    network measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable
    from other vantage points. Formatted: Fri Jun 21 18:23:29 PDT 2013</p>"
