abstract:
- content: "<p>The output of the IETF consists of documents. The IETF process is largely
    related to changing the status of documents. Active participation in the work
    of the IETF often consists of writing or editing documents or providing input
    to the process of changing the documents' status. Passive participation often
    consists of reading documents and observing the changes of their status. This
    document describes the requirements for an automated service that helps the IETF
    participants to learn about the existence and follow the changes of status of
    any particular document.</p>"
