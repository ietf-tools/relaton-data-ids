abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft addresses the need to complement the IP mobility protocols
    with respect to the co-ordination of a mobile node's network access. The concept
    of Network Access Agent (NAA) is introduced as a functional entity in the network
    to assist the mobile node's IP handoff strategy. The Network Access Co-ordination
    Protocol (NACP) is proposed as an interaction mechanism between the NAA and the
    mobile node, so that the NAA can provide valuable information and recommendations
    to the mobile node to consider in IP handoff. The NACP is conceived so that it
    is completely independent of the Mobile IP protocols.</p>"
