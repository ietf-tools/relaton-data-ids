abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the use of the RSA Signature algorithm [RSA] as
    an authentication algorithm within the revised IPSEC Encapsulating Security Payload
    [ESP] and the revised IPSEC Authentication Header [AH]. The use of a digital signature
    algorithm such as RSA provides origin authentication, even when ESP and AH are
    used to secure group data flows. Further information on the other components necessary
    for ESP and AH implementations is provided by [ROADMAP].</p>"
