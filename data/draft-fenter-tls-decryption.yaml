abstract:
- content: "<p>Some enterprises are heavily TLS encrypted within their own enterprise
    network boundaries. Many of these enterprises are also utilizing out-of-band TLS
    decryption in order to inspect their own traffic for purposes of troubleshooting,
    network security monitoring, and for other kinds of monitoring. These monitoring
    functions are mission critical, and cannot just be done without when TLS 1.3 (draft-ietf-tls-tls13-26)
    is released or when the RSA key exchange is someday deprecated from TLS 1.2 (RFC5246).
    This draft will outline the use cases for out-of-band TLS decryption, as well
    as alternative suggestions for monitoring and troubleshooting and the limitations
    of those alternatives.</p>"
