abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the redistribution extended community. This
    new extended community allows a router to influence how a specific route should
    be redistributed towards a specified set of eBGP speakers. Several types of redistribution
    communities are proposed. The first type may be used to indicate that a specific
    route should not be announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions. The second
    type may be used to indicate that the attached route should only be announced
    with the NO_EXPORT community over the specified set of eBGP sessions and the third
    type may be used to indicate that the attached route should be prepended n times
    when announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions.</p>"
