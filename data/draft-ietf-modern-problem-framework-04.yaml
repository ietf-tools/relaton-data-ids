abstract:
- content: "<p>The functions of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are rapidly
    migrating to the Internet. This is generating new requirements for many traditional
    elements of the PSTN, including Telephone Numbers (TNs). TNs no longer serve simply
    as telephone routing addresses: they are now identifiers that may be used by Internet-based
    services for a variety of purposes including session establishment, identity verification,
    and service enablement. This problem statement examines how the existing tools
    for allocating and managing telephone numbers do not align with the use cases
    of the Internet environment and proposes a framework for Internet-based services
    relying on TNs.</p>"
