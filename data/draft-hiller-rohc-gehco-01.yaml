abstract:
- content: "<p>The Robust Header Compression Working Group has embarked upon the development
    and standardization of header compression schemes that perform well over links
    with high error rates and long round-trip times. The goal is that the schemes
    must perform well for cellular links built using technologies such as WCDMA, EDGE,
    and cdma2000.</p>"
