abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-TTLS is an EAP method that provides secured authentication as described
    in RFC 5281. This method makes generally use of two phases in order to complete
    authentication. The first one consists in the authentication of the TTLS server
    to the client, established by a TLS handshake between the client and the TTLS
    server. The handshake may be either mutual or one-way. The authentication of the
    client to the server may then be negotiated during phase two of EAP-TTLS, thanks
    to widely-deployed authentication mechanisms such as CHAP, PAP, MS-CHAP or MS-CHAP-V2.
    The purpose of EAP-BIO is to define how to use a biometric authentication mechanism
    during phase two of EAP-TTLS. This authentication mechanism ranges from physiological
    characteristics such as fingerprint identification, to behavioral characteristics
    such as voice or signature analysis. Hence, EAP-BIO combines the security features
    of EAP-TTLS and biometric authentication.</p>"
