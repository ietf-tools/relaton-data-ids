abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP has been extended in several direction [DiffEdge], [Policy], [Identity],
    [DCLASS], [AggrRSVP], [COPS-RSVP], [COPS-RSVP+], one of the more relevant being
    the addition of the support for qualitative QoS [QualSvc]. This document refers
    to these extensions as RSVP+ and describes variations on standard RSVP router
    message processing. Specific variations are driven under policy control. Variations
    include admission control to diffserv aggregate classes, receiver proxying, support
    for aggregated and tunneled RSVP and others.</p>"
