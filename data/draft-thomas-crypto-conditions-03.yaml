abstract:
- content: <p>The crypto-conditions specification defines a set of encoding formats
    and data structures for *conditions* and *fulfillments*. A condition uniquely
    identifies a logical "boolean circuit" constructed from one or more logic gates,
    evaluated by either validating a cryptographic signature or verifying the preimage
    of a hash digest. A fulfillment is a data structure encoding one or more cryptographic
    signatures and hash digest preimages that define the structure of the circuit
    and provide inputs to the logic gates allowing for the result of the circuit to
    be evaluated. A fulfillment is validated by evaluating that the circuit output
    is TRUE but also that the provided fulfillment matches the circuit fingerprint,
    the condition. Since evaluation of some of the logic gates in the circuit (those
    that are signatures) also take a message as input the evaluation of the entire
    fulfillment takes an optional input message which is passed to each logic gate
    as required. As such the algorithm to validate a fulfillment against a condition
    and a message matches that of other signature schemes and a crypto-condition can
    serve as a sophisticated and flexible replacement for a simple signature where
    the condition is used as the public key and the fulfillment as the signature.</p>
