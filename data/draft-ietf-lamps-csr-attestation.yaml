abstract:
- content: "<p>A client requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA)
    may wish to offer believable claims about the protections afforded to the corresponding
    private key, such as whether the private key resides on a hardware securtiy model
    or trusted platform module, and the protection capabilities provided by the hardware
    module. Including this evidence along with the certificate request can help to
    improve the assessment of the security posture for the private key, and suitability
    of the submitted key to the requested certificate profile. These evidence claims
    can include information about the hardware component's manufacturer, the version
    of installed or running firmware, the version of software installed or running
    in layers above the firmware, or the presence of hardware components providing
    specific protection capabilities or shielded locations (e.g., to protect keys).
    Producing, conveying, and appraising such believable claims is enabled via remote
    attestation procedures where the device holding the private key takes on the role
    of an attester and produces evidence that is made available to remote parties
    in a cryptographically secured way. This document describes two new extensions
    to encode evidence produced by an attester for inclusion in PKCS#10 or CRMF certificate
    signing requests: an ASN.1 Attribute or Extension definition to convey a cryptographically-signed
    evidence statement to a Registration Authority or to a Certification Authority,
    and an ASN.1 Attribute or Extension to carry any certificates necessary for validating
    the cryptographically-signed evidence statement.</p>"
