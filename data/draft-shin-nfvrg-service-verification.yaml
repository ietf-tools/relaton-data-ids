abstract:
- content: "<p>NFV relocates network functions from dedicated hardware appliances
    to generic servers, so they can run in software. However, incomplete or inconsistent
    configuration of virtualized network functions (VNF) and forwarding graph (FG,
    aka service chain) could cause break-down of the supporting infrastructure. In
    this sense, verification is critical for network operators to check their requirements
    and network properties are correctly enforced in the supporting infrastructures.
    Recognizing these problems, we discuss key properties to be checked on NFV-enabled
    services. Also, we present challenging issues related to verification in NFV environments.</p>"
