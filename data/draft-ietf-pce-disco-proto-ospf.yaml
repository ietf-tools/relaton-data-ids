abstract:
- content: "<p>There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a
    Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover
    a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs), along with information that can be
    used by the PCC for PCE selection. When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR)
    participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating
    passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of
    using IGP flooding. For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the
    Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol for the advertisement of PCE
    Discovery information within an OSPF area or within the entire OSPF routing domain.
