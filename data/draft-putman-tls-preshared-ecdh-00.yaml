abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new mutual authentication method for the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2. The authentication method requires
    that the client and server are each pre-provisioned with a unique asymmetric Elliptic
    Curve Diffie- Hellman (ECDH) keypair and with the public ECDH key of the peer.
    The handshake provides ephemeral ECDH keys, and a premaster key is agreed using
    Double- or Triple-ECDH; confirmation of possession of this key provides mutual
    authentication. Multiple new cipher suites which use this authentication method
    are specified.</p>"
