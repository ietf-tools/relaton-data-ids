abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP (MIP) is the well-known protocol to handle the mobility of
    IP-based mobile nodes (MN). However, MIP has some drawbacks, including high latency
    in updates during a handover, and the need for infrastructure in the home networks
    of MNs. To enhance the mobility of nodes within a single domain, an access network
    (AN), several local mobility (also called micro mobility) management protocols
    have been suggested. All these protocols have their strengths and drawbacks. The
    deployment of these protocols is a chicken and egg problem, since both the AN
    and the MNs must support the same protocol. This draft presents a new protocol
    that can be used to replace the communication between the AN and the MNs in the
    existing local mobility management schemes. The protocol hides from MNs the AN-internal
    mobility management mechanisms and, therefore, allows MNs to log in to and roam
    within any AN regardless of the local mobility scheme used.</p>"
