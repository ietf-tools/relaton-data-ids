- content: "<p>RA sent to inform MN about the network prefix and gateway existed.But
    within a netlmm domain,MN should think that it's home network is kept unchanged
    when it is roaming and it's default gateway is unchanged is the best.But current
    the netlmm draft only can make the MN know the home network prefix.It can't give
    a convience way to make the gateway keep unchanged when the MN is roaming within
    a netlmm domain.</p>"
