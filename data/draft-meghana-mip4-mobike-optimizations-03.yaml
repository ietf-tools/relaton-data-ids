abstract:
- content: "<p>Users that need to connect to their enterprise network from an untrusted
    network require secure connectivity and mobility. Enterprise users are increasingly
    using mobile nodes. A user may need to connect to the enterprise network from
    anywhere, and in a number of scenarios, from untrusted networks. There are existing
    specifications developed by the Mobile IPv4 working group that describe solutions
    for enterprise secure connectivity and mobility. This document proposes optimizations
    to those solutions to reduce the tunneling overhead and allow for a number of
    new access modes.</p>"
