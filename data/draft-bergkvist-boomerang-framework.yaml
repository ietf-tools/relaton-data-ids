abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a framework for providing quantitative IP services
    with guaranteed QoS. The proposed reservation approach is based on a new, lightweight
    signaling protocol and it suits both Diff-Serv, Int-Serv QoS architectures. The
    main designing principle of the Boomerang protocol is to make reservation almost
    as simple as forwarding an ordinary packet. Thus: * Signaling messages are generated
    only by the initiating node, therefore complexity and intelligence is concentrated
    in one point enabling simple implementation * Flow state aggregation can be suggested
    to subsequent nodes by appending the Boomerang message</p>"
