abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a compression method based on the data compression
    algorithm described in ITU-T Recommendation V.44 [V44]. Recommendation V.44 is
    a modem standard but Annex B of the recommendation describes the implementation
    of V.44 in packet networks. This document defines the application of V.44 to packets
    or messages where some or all of the contents of the data is known ahead of time.
    For such applications the V.44 dictionary is partially pre-loaded after intialization
    with words and/or phrases that are expected to appear in the data. This Internet
    Draft describes the mechanism of the dictionary pre-load and its advantages for
    applications such as SIP/SDP.</p>"
