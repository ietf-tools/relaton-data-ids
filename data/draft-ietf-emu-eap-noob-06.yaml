abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the EAP-NOOB authentication method
    for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and key derivation. The EAP method
    is intended for bootstrapping all kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that
    have no preconfigured authentication credentials. The method makes use of a user-assisted,
    one-directional, out-of-band (OOB) message between the peer device and authentication
    server to authenticate the in-band key exchange. The device must have a nonnetwork
    input or output interface, such as a display, microphone, speaker, or blinking
    light, that can send or receive dynamically generated messages of tens of bytes
    in length.</p>"
