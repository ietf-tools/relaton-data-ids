abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a new internetworking architecture which makes
    better use of the property of ATM. IP datagrams are transferred along hop-by-hop
    path via routers, but datagram assembly/disassembly and IP header processing are
    not necessarily carried out at individual routers in the proposed architecture.
    A concept of 'Cell Switch Router (CSR)' is introduced as a new internetworking
    equipment, which has ATM cell switching capabilities in addition to conventional
    IP datagram forwarding. Proposed architecture can provide applications with high-throughput
    and low-latency ATM pipes while retaining current router-based internetworking
    concept. It also provides applications with specific QoS/bandwidth by cooperating
    with internetworking level resource reservation protocols such as RSVP.</p>"
