abstract:
- content: "<p>Operational efficiency in incident management on telecom and computer
    networks requires correlating and interpreting large volumes of heterogeneous
    technical information. Knowledge graphs can provide a unified view of complex
    systems through shared vocabularies. YANG data models enable describing network
    configurations and automating their deployment. However, both approaches face
    challenges in vocabulary alignment and adoption, hindering knowledge capitalization
    and sharing on network designs and best practices. To address this, the concept
    of a meta-knowledge graph is introduced to leverage existing network infrastructure
    descriptions in YANG format and enable abstract reasoning on network behaviors.
    An experiment is proposed to assess the potential of the meta-knowledge graph
    in improving network quality and designs.</p>"
