abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses common practices used in deploying routing
    protocols in both public and private networks. The focus is not to describe how
    routing protocols should be deployed, but rather how they are generally deployed,
    to provide those working on specifications which impact the operation of routing
    protocols with guidance in what will likely be deployed, or what will likely not
    be deployed. The focus in thie document will be ionterdomain routing, but it will
    cover aspects of intradomain routing, as well.1. Background When considering new
    extensions to existing routing protocols, it's useful to consider them in the
    context of existing usage of these protocols. Various questions come to mind,
    such as: o Common Underlying Principles of Network Designs o Common Practices
    in Route Origination o Common Practices in Routing Database Management o Common
    Practices in Aggregation o Common Practices in Peering o Common Practices in Security
    o .... Each of these topics will be covered in a separate section below.</p>"
