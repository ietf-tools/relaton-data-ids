abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores the issues in the registration of internationalized
    domain names (IDNs). The basic IDN definition allows a very large number of possible
    characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion
    about similar-looking names. To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process
    must impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations. This document
    suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and implement
    such rules for a broad range of languages, including adaptation of methods developed
    for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
