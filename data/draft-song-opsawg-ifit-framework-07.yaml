abstract:
- content: "<p>For efficient network operation, most network operators rely on traditional
    Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include proactive
    and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes. As networks increase
    in scale, they become more susceptible to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration
    errors. With the advent of programmable data-plane, emerging on-path telemetry
    techniques provide unprecedented flow insight and fast notification of network
    issues (e.g., jitter, increased latency, packet loss, significant bit error variations,
    and unequal load- balancing). This document outlines an In-situ Flow Information
    Telemetry (iFIT) reference framework, which enumerates several high level components
    and describes how these components can be assembled to achieve a complete and
    closed-loop working solution for on-path telemetry. iFIT addresses several deployment
    challenges for on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier networks. As
    an open framework, it does not detail the implementation of the components as
    well as the interface between the components.</p>"
