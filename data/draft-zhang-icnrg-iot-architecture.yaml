abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to
    Internet. Nowadays, the IoT landscape is very fragmented from both technological
    and service perspectives. As a consequence, it is difficult to cross correlate
    data coming from heterogeneous contexts and build added value services on top
    of them. For this reason, the current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented
    IoT platform so that objects can be made accessible to applications across organizations
    and domains. Towards this goal, quite a few proposals have been made to build
    a unified IoT platform as an overlay on top of today's Internet. Such overlay
    solutions, however, inherit the same limitations of the IP protocol, in terms
    of mobility, security, scalability and communication reliability. To address this
    problem, we propose a unified IoT platform based on the Information Centric Networking
    (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT [2]. ICN-IoT leverages the salient features
    of ICN, and thus provides seamless device-to-device (D2D) communication, mobility
    support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery. Furthermore,
    in order to guarantee the real diffusion of ICN-IoT architecture it is fundamental
    to deal with security and privacy requirements, since the system may handle sensitive
    information (e.g., user habits, devices location). Note that ICN-IoT needs to
    manage the security requirements at the early stage of the design, representing
    all the involved entities and their relationships, in order to better understand
    their interactions and, consequently, apply the proper countermeasures to the
    possible security attacks (e.g., data violation, privacy violation, access attacks).
    This draft begins by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT platform to connect
    heterogenous IoT systems. We then propose an ICN-IoT system architecture and middleware
    components which includes device/network-service discovery, naming service, IoT
    service discovery, data discovery, user registration, and content delivery. For
    all of these components, a secure solution is defined too. We also provide discussions
    on inter-connecting heterogeneous ICN-IoT domains.</p>"
