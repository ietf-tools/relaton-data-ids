abstract:
- content: "<p>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques, and
    many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high-bandwidth
    applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    has strongly discouraged the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of
    MPLS-TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) performance cannot be
    avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations. Using MPLS
    Entropy Labels (RFC 6790), MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be carried over
    multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP-compliant server layer for
    MPLS-TP LSPs. This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server
    layer for MPLS-TP. The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is
    also discussed.</p>"
