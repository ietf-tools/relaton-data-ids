abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a standardized set of API endpoints for securely
    changing user passwords, using a unique identifier prefix to ensure compatibility
    and avoid conflicts with other APIs. As the number of online accounts continues
    to grow, managing passwords has become increasingly challenging. Even with the
    use of password managers, the process of updating passwords-whether due to a security
    breach, expiration, or other reasons-remains a time-consuming and manual task.
    Currently, there is no standardized method for performing password changes across
    various platforms, which further complicates this process. The goal of this proposal
    is to establish a universal standard for password change processes, enabling password
    managers and services to automate password updates with minimal configuration,
    thereby reducing the burden on users and improving overall security.</p>"
