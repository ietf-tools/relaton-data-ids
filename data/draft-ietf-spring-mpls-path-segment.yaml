abstract:
- content: "<p>A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment list. Only
    the complete segment list can identify the end-to-end SR path, and a sub-set of
    segments from the segment list cannot distinguish one SR path from another as
    they may be partially congruent. SR path identification is a pre-requisite for
    various use-cases such as Performance Measurement (PM), bidirectional paths correlation,
    and end-to-end 1+1 path protection. In SR for MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), the segment
    identifiers are stripped from the packet through label popping as the packet transits
    the network. This means that when a packet reaches the egress of the SR path,
    it is not possible to determine on which SR path it traversed the network. This
    document defines a new type of segment that is referred to as Path Segment, which
    is used to identify an SR path in an SR-MPLS network. When used, it is inserted
    by the ingress node of the SR path and immediately follows the last segment identifier
    in the segment list of the SR path. The Path Segment is preserved until it reaches
    the egress node for SR path identification and correlation.</p>"
