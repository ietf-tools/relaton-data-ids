abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS provides fundamental mutual authentication services for HTTP, supporting
    up to one server certificate and up to one client certificate associated to the
    session to prove client and server identities as necessary. This draft provides
    mechanisms for providing additional such certificates at the HTTP layer when these
    constraints are not sufficient. Many HTTP servers host content from several origins.
    HTTP/2 [RFC7540] permits clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a server
    provided that the secondary origin is also in the certificate provided during
    the TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] handshake. In many cases, servers will wish to maintain
    separate certificates for different origins but still desire the benefits of a
    shared HTTP connection. Similarly, servers may require clients to present authentication,
    but have different requirements based on the content the client is attempting
    to access. This document describes how TLS exported authenticators [I-D.sullivan-tls-exported-authenticator]
    can be used to provide proof of ownership of additional certificates to the HTTP
    layer to support both scenarios.</p>"
