abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes a method to exploit the Cryptographically Generated
    Address (CGA) features in highly mobile environment. The draft introduces a new
    optimization to the "Binding Update Backhauling (BUB)" proposal, which eliminates
    the need for running a return routability (RR) procedure at the beginning and
    improves its security.</p>
