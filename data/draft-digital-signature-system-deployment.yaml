abstract:
- content: "<p>Conventional deployments store keys on PC hard disks, application-
    server hard disks, or in tokens, and also introduce complications for user enrollment
    and management. User and administrator frustration with the conventional approach
    has cramped development of a market for PKI. As a result, PKI has not reached
    its utilization potential and is far from becoming ubiquitous. This document describes
    architecture for deployment of secure and efficient digital signature capabilities
    based on a centralized key- management approach and emphasizes the importance
    of not disrupting existing identity and authentication management and application
    infrastructure. An alternative architecture is documented here so that PKI deployments
    will lower their associated administrative burdens and deliver improved scalability.</p>"
