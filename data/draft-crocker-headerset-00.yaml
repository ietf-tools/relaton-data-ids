abstract:
- content: "<p>Data often are aggregated with an initial set of descriptor information,
    followed by some number of user data portions. This specification formalizes the
    occurrences of such aggregations as a MIME Multipart Content-type. It is intended
    that MIME processors which are aware of the Header-Set construct will be able
    to process the user data portions, even when they do not understand the specific
    header (or descriptor) information which begins the set.</p>"
