    of Virtual CPE (vCPE) solutions. The concept of vCPE is build around the idea

    Provider Network. This document starts discussing the drivers behind vCPE adoption
    followed by Solution level requirements. Two key Architecture models for vCPE,
    which can address the service provider and subscriber requirements, are covered
