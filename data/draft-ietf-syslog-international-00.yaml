abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes syslog-international, a mechanism adding support
    for international character sets to syslog. Syslog-international provides these
    features in a way that has no requirements and no impact on existing syslog implementations.
    It is possible to support syslog-international and gain some of its functionality
    by only changing the behavior of the devices generating syslog messages. Some
    additional processing of the received syslog messages may realize additional benefits.
    There is no need to change syslog relays in order to support syslog-international.
    Existing syslog implementations will benefit from the fact that syslog-international
    supporting devices emit proper syslog messages in all cases. It is common practice
    for many non-syslog-international clients to accidently emit 8 bit characters
    if used in e.g. European language environments. Syslog-international just adds
    a protocol layer to the MSG part of the syslog message. As such, it is compatible
    with all existing and future implementations of syslog.</p>"
