abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the mechanism for the autoconfiguration of recursive
    DNS server in mobile node and the optimization of DNS name resolution in the hierarchical
    mobile IPv6 network. Whenever the mobile node moves into a new MAP domain, the
    region managed by another MAP, in the hierarchical mobile IPv6 network, it detects
    the addresses of recursive DNS servers which are placed in the region and replaces
    the old ones with the new ones for DNS name resolution. This allows the time for
    DNS name resolution much reduced by using the nearest recursive DNS server which
    exists in the region. Therefore, the mechanism of this document can optimize the
    DNS name resolution.</p>"
