abstract:
- content: "<p>lightweight 4over6(lw4over6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an extension
    to DS-Lite in which the amount of state maintained in lwAFTR has been reduced
    to per-subscriber-level. The lwB4 needs to be provisioned with the public IPv4
    address and port set it is allowed to use. The DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport [I.D-ietf-dhc-
    dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option for
    Port Set [I.D-sun-dhc-port-set-option] can be used for lwB4 to provison with the
    public IPv4 address and port set. However, in many networks, the configuration
    information may be stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
    servers while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).
    This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute
    that carries lightweight 4over6 configuration information from AAA server to BNG.</p>"
