abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP signaling may be used to enhance the manageability of application
    traffic's QoS in a differentiated service (diff-serv) network [intdiff]. In this
    model, certain network elements within or at the edges of the diff-serv network
    may use RSVP messages to effect admission control or to apply QoS policy. One
    mechanism by which network elements may apply QoS policy is by causing a DCLASS
    object to be returned to a sending host in an RSVP RESV message. The DCLASS object
    indicates the diff-serv DSCP that the sender should include when submitting packets
    on the admitted flow, to the diff- serv network. This draft describes the usage
    and format of the DCLASS object.</p>"
