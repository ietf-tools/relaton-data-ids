abstract:
- content: "<p>The DHCP protocol is designed to allow for multiple DHCP servers, so
    that reliability of DHCP service can be improved through the use of redundant
    servers. To provide redundant service, multiple DHCP servers must carry the same
    information about assigned IP addresses and parameters; i.e., the servers must
    be configured with the same bindings. Because DHCP servers may dynamically assign
    new addresses or configuration parameters, or extend the lease on an existing
    address assignment, the bindings on some servers may become out of date. The DHCP
    inter-server protocol provides an automatic mechanism for synchronization of the
    bindings stored on a set of cooperating DHCP servers. The underlying capabilities
    of the DHCP inter-server protocol required for multiple server cache replications
    are based upon the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP).</p>"
