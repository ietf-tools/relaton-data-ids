abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed
    to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such
    information to applications that need to choose one or more endpoints to connect
    to among large sets of logically equivalent ones. The primary use case for the
    ALTO protocol was peer-to-peer applications for file sharing, video streaming
    and realtime communications, usually running on end-user devices. However, a number
    of other applications executing in more controlled environments may also benefit
    from the information that can be exported through the ALTO protocol. The use cases
    that have received significant attention include Content Delivery Networks (CDNs),
    distributed applications running in large datacenters, as well as systems made
    of inter-communicating ALTO servers. To apply ALTO to these new use cases, this
    document aims to foster a discussion to determine if, and how, the ALTO protocol
    could be extended to provide a simple yet useful view of a computational environment
    that goes beyond the static (or near static) network topology and cost map information.</p>"
