abstract:
- content: "<p>An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between
    client and server for computing the output of a Pseudorandom Function (PRF). The
    server provides the PRF secret key, and the client provides the PRF input. At
    the end of the protocol, the client learns the PRF output without learning anything
    about the PRF secret key, and the server learns neither the PRF input nor output.
    An OPRF can also satisfy a notion of 'verifiability', called a VOPRF. A VOPRF
    ensures clients can verify that the server used a specific private key during
    the execution of the protocol. A VOPRF can also be partially-oblivious, called
    a POPRF. A POPRF allows clients and servers to provide public input to the PRF
    computation. This document specifies an OPRF, VOPRF, and POPRF instantiated within
    standard prime-order groups, including elliptic curves.</p>"
