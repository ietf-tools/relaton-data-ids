abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio technologies
    and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks based on CoAP. The emerging
    Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWA) present a particular set of constraints, which
    places them at the intersection of infrastructure networks, ultra-dense networks,
    delay- tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks. The main objectives
    of LPWA signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged messages, minimize the
    size of each message in a secure and extensible manner, all with keeping the fundamental
    principle of technology-independence (L2-independence). This document describes
    the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as the main signaling protocol
    for LPWA, over which minimal messages are exchanged allowing the full operation
    of the network, such as authentication, authorization, and management. The use
    of CoAP signaling provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to different
    LPWA technologies.</p>"
