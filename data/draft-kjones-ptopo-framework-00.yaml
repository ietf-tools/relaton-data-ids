abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a framework for the collection of physical topology
    information. Physical topology is defined as the physical interconnection of communication
    ports between communication devices. The framework allows for topology determination
    within and across a broad spectrum of devices. It establishes a set of guidelines
    for topology mechanisms used to distribute and collect topology information, and
    describes the behavior of a management station required to collect topology information
    across a potentially large and diverse set of communication devices. A companion
    memo will provide an experimental portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    which is derived from this framework and allows the management workstation to
    gather physical topology information from the devices in the network.</p>"
