abstract:
- content: "<p>As the group communication become more important, the special label
    should be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. The allocation
    mechanism of a group label can be applied to a point- to-multipoint(P2MP) communication
    in MPLS networks. Currently used label is locally significant, while this group
    label should be common object within a single MPLS domain. This document presents
    a set of requirements for multicast service using a group label over Multiprotocol
    Label Switching(MPLS). It identifies functional and performance capabilities required
    to allocate a group label in master-slave network and peer to peer network, which
    facilitates efficient and reliable group communication and Quality of Service(QoS)
    in MPLS domain. It also identifies functional capabilities required to implement
    several services related to Content Distribution Network(CDN) in master-slave
    network.</p>"
