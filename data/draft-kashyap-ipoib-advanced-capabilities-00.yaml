abstract:
- content: "<p>InfiniBand Architecture(IBA) defines a high speed, channel based interconnect
    between systems and devices. The InfiniBand architecture provides multiple modes
    of transport services with differing characteristics. IPoIB may be implemented
    over any or multiple such modes to take advantage of the underlying mode's features.
    IPoIB by default is implemented over the UD mode of IBA. This document describes
    IPoIB over IBA's non-UD transport modes.</p>"
