abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo sets out an MPLS-based solution to the IP service delivery
    problems as set out in RFC 2990. The solution is based on source routing of IP
    flows using MPLS label stacks. The solution elements are introduced sequentially
    and a usage scenario is mapped out that aligns with the work in the ISSLL working
    group.</p>"
