abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multicast Address Request Protocol (MARP) serves as a front end
    to the Multicast Address Allocation Architecture. Any host that wishes to allocate
    a multicast address may contact a Multicast Address Allocation Server and use
    MARP to request an address allocation for a specific interval, scope, etc. Later,
    the host may request an extension of the address allocation or deallocate the
    address if it is no longer needed.</p>"
