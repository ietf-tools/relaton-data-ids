abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF specifications do not receive formal review until they are submitted
    to the IESG. Hence, significant problems with a specification often are not detected
    until considerable effort has been wasted and changes to fix the problems are
    difficult to add. The procedure described in this document is intended to solve,
    or palliate, a number of related problems that have been observed in the IETF
    process. The basic model is to create a team of Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS),
    and have all documents receive a certain number of reviews by SIRs, prior to being
    submitted for publication. Review at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.</p>"
