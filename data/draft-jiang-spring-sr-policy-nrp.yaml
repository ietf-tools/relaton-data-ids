abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated information. A Network Resource
    Partition (NRP), is a subset of the resources and associated policies in the underlay
    network. In SR networks with multiple NRPs, an SR Policy can be associated with
    a particular NRP. In that case, SR Policy can be used for steering and forwarding
    traffic which is mapped to the NRP, so that the packets can be processed with
    the subset of network resources and policy of the NRP for guaranteed performance.
    Thus the association between SR Policy and NRP needs to be specified. This document
    describes how the SR Policy extension for associated NRP and the operational mechanisms
    function together.</p>"
