abstract:
- content: "<p>For a handoff action using the mobile IPv6, we need two functions:
    re-routing on the wired region of the network and the activation of the air-link
    on the wireless region. In this architecture, a possibility of small break for
    a session is still large by the signaling overhead between Home Agent and Mobile
    Node (MN). We propose a new handoff method using the Explicit Multicast (xcast)
    technique. On the wired section, control/user packets are multicasted by xcast
    scheme to the Base Stations where MN can receive, then packets are passed to the
    air-link activated between a BS and the MN.</p>"
