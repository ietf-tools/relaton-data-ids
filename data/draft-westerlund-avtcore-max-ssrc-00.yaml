abstract:
- content: "<p>RTP has always been a protocol that supports multiple participants
    each sending their own media streams in an RTP session. Unfortunately many implementations
    are designed only for point to point voice over IP with a single source in each
    end-point. Even client implementations aimed at video conferences have often been
    built with the assumption around central mixers that only deliver a single media
    stream per media type. Thus any application that wants to allow for more advance
    usage where multiple media streams are sent and received by an end-point has an
    issue with legacy implementations. This document describes the problem and proposes
    a solution for how to use multiple SSRCs within one RTP session and at the same
    time handle the legacy issues.</p>"
