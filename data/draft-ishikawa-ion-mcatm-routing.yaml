abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the specification for IP multicast routing over
    ATM. This memo specifies the architecture and the protocol for scalable IP multicast
    routing over ATM, based on the shared tree architecture. Multicast shortcuts over
    ATM are possible in an efficient and scalable manner. The same messages as specified
    for IP multicasting over ATM MLIS [1] are applied for IP multicast routing over
    ATM, with some extensions.</p>"
