abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of models for MANET and NEMO. It
    descibes the MANET and the NEMO characteristics. It also also lists problems using
    the MANET and NEMO technology, when problems are not described in other documents.
    It is claimed that MANET suits small mobile network topologies, providing optimal
    paths for communication within a MANET cloud and towards the outside. It is also
    claimed that NEMO suits small mobile subnets, providing sub-optimal paths for
    to Internet connected nodes. This document is used for evaluating a need for a
    MANET for NEMO, called MANEMO.</p>"
