- content: "<p>Key rollovers will be needed for secure deployment of the DNS secu-
    rity extensions (DNSSEC). From an end-user perspective these rollovers should
    be transparent i.e. at any point in time an end-user should be able to verify
    the chain of trust from a statically config- ured secure entry point.</p>"
