abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) specifies the baseline
    XML-based format for describing presence information. One of the characteristics
    of the PIDF is that the document always needs to carry all presence information
    available for the presentity. In some environments where low bandwidth and high
    latency links can exist, it is often beneficial to limit the amount of transported
    information over the network. This document introduces a new MIME type that enables
    transporting of either only the changed parts or the full PIDF-based presence
    information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
