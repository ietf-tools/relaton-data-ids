abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support
    ASON routing requirements in [RFC5787]. No extensions were defined for bandwidth
    advertisement as the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor may optionally
    be included for each layer of a multi-layer link [RFC4202]. However, for some
    types SONET/SDH links there can be several data plane layers supported by a single
    link, and as a result a need to carry several copies of the ISCD. This draft defines
    an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for SONET/SDH that removes the need
    to carry multiple copies of the ISCD sub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent
    with advertisement of bandwidth for OTN.</p>"
