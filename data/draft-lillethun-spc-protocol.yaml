abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Path Control Protocol (SPC) defined in this document is
    a new protocol defined to enable processes external to networks to establish,
    delete and monitor paths, including lightpaths. The architecture of this protocol
    establishes a method of providing messages, and procedures that allow such external
    processes to use those messages to directly request network resources related
    to path provisioning.</p>"
