abstract:
- content: "<p>This document generalizes the applicability of the pseudowire (PW)
    Associated Channel Header (ACH), enabling the realization of a control channel
    associated to MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and MPLS Sections in addition to
    MPLS pseudowires. In order to identify the presence of this Associated Channel
    Header in the label stack, this document also assigns one of the reserved MPLS
    label values to the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL), to be used as a label
    based exception mechanism.</p>"
