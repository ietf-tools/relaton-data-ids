abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP- BGP)now plays
    an important role in the transition of the core as well as edge from IPv4 to IPv6.
    Operators can now continue to support legacy IPv4, VPN-IPv4, and Multicast VPN-IPv4
    customers. This document describes the critical use case and OPEX savings of being
    able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange usage as a pure transport, allowing
    both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the same BGP TCP session. By doing so, allows
    for the elimination of Dual Stacking on the PE-CE connections. Thus making the
    eBGP peering IPv6-ONLY to now carry both IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI). This document now provides a solution for IXPs (Internet Exchange
    points) that are facing IPv4 address depletion at these peering points to use
    BGP-MP capability exchange defined in [RFC8950] to carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability
    Information) NLRI in an IPv6 next hop using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.</p>"
