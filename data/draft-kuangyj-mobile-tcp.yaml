abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two types of IP addresses to support mobile TCP
    - one for routing and location management, the other for host identification.
    Therefore, the dependency of TCP/UDP socket identification upon the network layer
    is eliminated, and transmission sessions will be no longer dependent of network
    layer IP address, that is, location changes of a mobile host result only new network
    IP address, which has no impact on transmission communications and its continuity.</p>"
