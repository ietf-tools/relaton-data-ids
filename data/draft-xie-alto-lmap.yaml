abstract:
- content: "<p>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale for network diagnostics
    is important to providers and users, as well as for public policy. The Large-scale
    Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework, information model, and
    protocol have been developed for measurement task dissemination, initialization,
    reporting and storing. This document uses the ALTO protocol to provide access
    to large-scale network measurement results, which could be useful to constitute
    the ALTO cost map service and the endpoint cost service. Potential ALTO protocol
    extensions are also discussed to better leverage LMAP measurement results.</p>"
