abstract:
- content: "<p>Delegation occurs when an NS record is added in the parent zone for
    the child origin. In the current DNS delegation mechanism, a delegated zone/child
    zone (see Section1.1 for definition of delegated zone) can specify any NS records
    at the zone apex without requiring confirmation from the zone maintaining Glue
    records of the NS record. Recently, new types of attacks that exploit this flaw
    have been discovered. This draft suggests a protocol-level solution for DNS delegation
    confirmation to reduce the risk of these attacks.</p>"
