abstract:
- content: "<p>The ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) protocol is designed
    to find the best possible transmission path between two endpoints in the presence
    of intervening NAT (Network Address Translation) boxes. It is a very versatile
    protocol, designed to operate in all possible network topologies. This versatility
    occasionally results in a large exchange of messages between the two endpoints.
    This document proposes a modification which reduces the amount of messaging ICE
    requires, without affecting the effectiveness of ICE. This modification suppresses
    the transmission of Binding Requests from server-reflexive candidates. The result
    is increased efficiency due to the suppressed connectivity checks, leading to
    fewer overall messages and faster discovery of working paths.</p>"
