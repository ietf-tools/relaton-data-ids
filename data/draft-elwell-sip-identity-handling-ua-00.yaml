abstract:
- content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UA) receive identifiers
    for the caller and callee during call establishment. These identifiers can come
    in a variety of forms, can be delivered by a variety of means, and may or may
    not be accompanied by evidence of authenticity. Furthermore, if media are secured
    (e.g., using the Secure Real-Time Protocol, SRTP), the security properties of
    the media will depend on binding the media to a received authenticated identifier.
    This document examines the various identification information a UA can receive
    during call establishment and how a user agent can use this information to present
    a caller or callee identifier to the user and indicate to the user the security
    properties of the call, as well as how the user agent might use this information
    for other purposes, such as authorizing acceptance of a call. This work is being
    discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
