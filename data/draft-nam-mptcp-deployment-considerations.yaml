abstract:
- content: "<p>Network-Assisted MPTCP deployment models are designed to facilitate
    the adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of multi-path communications without
    making any assumption about the support of MPTCP by the communicating peers. MPTCP
    Conversion Points (MCPs) located in the network are responsible for establishing
    multi-path communications on behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of
    MPTCP capabilities to achieve different goals that include (but are not limited
    to) optimization of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of resiliency
    (e.g., primary/backup communication paths), and traffic offload management. This
    document describes Network-Assisted MPTCP uses cases, deployment scenarios, and
    operational considerations.</p>"
