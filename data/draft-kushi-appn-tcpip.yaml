abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the message formats and protocols used by IBM
    to interconnect instances of its APPN NN offering using TCP/IP. We believe the
    information is of sufficient depth to allow any implementer to readily construct
    a TCP/IP platform on which to base the APPN protocol stack in order to interoperate
    with other offerings from other vendors that implement the same set of protocols
    and use the same message formats described here in this draft.</p>"
