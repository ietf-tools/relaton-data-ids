abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores how existing IETF YANG data models can be applied
    to support a use case involving dynamic, time-scoped UCMP (Unequal Cost Multipath)
    policy enforcement across multiple network segments interconnecting Edge Cloud
    sites. The use case is motivated by periodic, high-volume data exchanges between
    distributed AI inference modules placed at geographically dispersed edge data
    centers. By mapping network requirements such as bandwidth, latency, and availability
    to relevant YANG models, including AC, TE Topology, SR Policy, and QoS models,
    this document serves as a practical exercise to evaluate the applicability and
    limitations of current IETF specifications. It highlights the need for cloud-initiated,
    time-bounded network policy activation and identifies potential gaps in model
    expressiveness, policy lifecycle handling, and API-level abstraction required
    for real-time cloud-network coordination.</p>"
