abstract:
- content: "<p>This document registers new disposition-types for the Content- Disposition
    header field that apply to the application/3gpp-ims+xml body (part) used by 3GPP
    [5]. The applicability of these content- disposition values are limited to 3GPP
    IMS [5]. The application/ 3gpp-ims+xml body (part) has the following three distinct
    uses: (1) for redirecting the emergency session to use a different domain (e.g.
    using a Circuit Switched call), (2) for delivering user profile specific information
    from the SIP registrar to an Application Server, and (3) for causing a UAC to
    attempt to re-register with the IMS.</p>"
