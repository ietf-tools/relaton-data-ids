abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies tests to determine if multiple independent
    instantiations of a performance-metric RFC have implemented the specifications
    in the same way. This is the performance-metric equivalent of interoperability,
    required to advance RFCs along the Standards Track. Results from different implementations
    of metric RFCs will be collected under the same underlying network conditions
    and compared using statistical methods. The goal is an evaluation of the metric
    RFC itself to determine whether its definitions are clear and unambiguous to implementors
    and therefore a candidate for advancement on the IETF Standards Track. This document
    is an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
