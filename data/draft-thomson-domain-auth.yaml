abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a standard method for digitally signing Presence
    Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents using a subset of
    the XML Digital Signature specification. A digital signature enables the user
    of a signed PIDF-LO document to attribute that information to an authorized source
    within the domain of the target entity. A schema is defined for including a domain
    authorization element in the PIDF-LO and a set of XML Path Language (XPath) filters
    for selecting the correct elements for signing.</p>"
