abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
    content type for Autonomous System Relationship Authorization (ASRA) objects for
    use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). An ASRA is a digitally
    signed object through which the issuer (the holder of an Autonomous System identifier),
    can authorize one or more other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its customers and
    lateral peers. When validated, an ASRA's eContent can be used for detection and
    mitigation of BGP AS path manipulation attacks together with Autonomous System
    Provider Authorization (ASPA). ASRA is complementary to ASPA.</p>"
