abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Stack" (BIS) host based protocol
    translation mechanism that allows applications supporting only one IP address
    family to communicate with peers that are reachable or supporting only the other
    address family. Furthermore, this technology avoids need for unnecessary double
    protocol translation in the case where destination is dual-stack enabled. This
    specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dual stack or IPv6
    only network connectivity. In the dual stack network case, single address family
    applications in the host will communicate directly with other hosts reachable
    with the different address family. In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only
    destination, IPv4-originated communications have to be be translated into IPv6.
    In the scenario of single address family access network, but dual- stack destination,
    network based translation is always avoided. Technically, the BIS-enabled host
    resolves both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the destination and behaves according
    to received responses. Acknowledgement of previous work This document is an update
    to and directly derivative from Kazuaki TSUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI, and Yoshifumi
    ATARASHI's [RFC2767], which similarly provides a dual stack host means to communicate
    with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4 appliations.The original document was
    a product of the NGTRANS working group. The changes in this document reflect three
    components 1. Supporting IPv6 only network connections 2. Extending ENR and address
    mapper to operate differently 3. Adding an alternative way to implement the ENRStatus
