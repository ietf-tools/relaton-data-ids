abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for establishing
    networking connections anywhere and anytime, alongside the availability of highly
    distributive any-cloud services. Such a demand motivates the need to efficiently
    interconnect heterogeneous entities, e.g., different domains of network and cloud
    owned by different providers, with the goal of reducing cost, e.g., overheads
    and end-to-end latency, while ensuring the overall performance satisfies the requirements
    of the applications. Considering that different network domains and cloud providers
    may adopt different types of technologies, the key of interconnection and efficient
    coordination is to employ a unified interface that can be understood by heterogeneous
    parties which could derive the consistent requirements of the same service and
    treat the service traffic appropriately by their proprietary policies and technologies.
    This document provides use cases and problem statements from two main Internet
    traffic categories: one is the traditional north-south traffic which is defined
    from clients to entities (such as servers or DCs), and the other is east-west
    traffic which refers to traffic between entities (such as inter-server or inter-service).The
    requirements for a standalone Service ID are also derived.</p>"
