abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the existing Internet routing architecture/protocols different
    hosts within a domain (autonomous system) usually can't control the choice of
    adjacent domains for forwarding of the inter-domain traffic originated by the
    hosts. In this document we describe a simple mechanism that provides hosts with
    such control. The proposed scheme can be realised with the existing technology,
    off-the shelf components, and minor tweaking of forwarding algorithm by border
    routers. The scheme doesn't require any new routing protocols.</p>"
