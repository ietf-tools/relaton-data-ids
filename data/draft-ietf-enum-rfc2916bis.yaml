abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) for
    storage of E.164 numbers. More specifically, how DNS can be used for identifying
    available services connected to one E.164 number. It specifically obsoletes RFC
    2916 to bring it in line with the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application
    specification found in the document series specified in RFC 3401. It is very important
    to note that it is impossible to read and understand this document without reading
    the documents discussed in RFC 3401. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
