abstract:
- content: "<p>For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 specification requires the mobile access gateway to send a Proxy Binding
    Update message to the local mobility anchor on a per-session basis. In the absence
    of signaling semantics for performing operations with group-specific scope, this
    results in a significant amount of signaling traffic on a periodic basis between
    a given mobile access gateway and a local mobility anchor. This document defines
    optimizations to the binding update and revocation operations in Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 for performing operations with group-specific scope with the use of a group
    identifier. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
