abstract:
- content: "<p>A simple method of implementing Application Aware Networking using
    the Domain Name System (DNS) is discussed. This enables DNS system responses that
    are dependent on communication service quality requirements without changes in
    the format of DNS protocol messages or application program interfaces (APIs).
    Such responses can provide lightweight support to application aware networking.</p>"
