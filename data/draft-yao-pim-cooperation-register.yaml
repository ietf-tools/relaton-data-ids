abstract:
- content: "<p>Anycast RP (Rendezvous Point) protocol [N2] is designed to provide
    load balancing and failover for RP. However, there is no cooperation mechanism
    among anycast RP members when sending Register-Stop to DR and transferringRegisters
    among anycast RP members. The former results in the subscribers under some Anycast
    RP members having multicast service interruption and the latter leads to bandwidth
    waste among Anycast RP members due to trashy Registers. This specification solves
    these problems by giving the cooperation mechanism among anycast RP members.</p>"
