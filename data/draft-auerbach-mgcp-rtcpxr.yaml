abstract:
- content: "<p>The main intent of this document is to define a Media Gateway Control
    Protocol (MGCP) package to control the reporting of metrics supported by the VoIP
    metrics block in RTCP Extended Reports as specified in [RFC 3611]. It also allows
    the call agent to control whether or not the gateway will request a peer device
    via SDP to send the VoIP metrics block in RTCP Extended Reports and whether it
    will respond positively to such requests from the peer device. Besides this primary
    focus, this MGCP RTCP-XR Package 4/12/2007 package also allows the reporting of
    metrics defined for RTCP Sender Reports and Receiver Reports [RFC 3550] and the
    reporting of session description parameters (based on the ones defined in RFC
    2327, RFC 2198 etc.).</p>"
