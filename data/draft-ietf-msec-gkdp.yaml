abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a group key distribution protocol (GKDP) based
    on IKEv2, the IPsec key management protocol; the new protocol is similar to IKEv2
    in message and payload formats, and message semantics to a large extent. The protocol
    in conformance with MSEC key management architecture contains two components:
    member registration and group rekeying, and downloads a group security association
    from the GCKS to a member. This protocol is independent of IKEv2 except in its
    likeness.</p>"
