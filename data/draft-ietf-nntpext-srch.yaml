abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of enhancements to the Network News Transport
    Protocol [NNTP-977] that allows full-text searching of news articles in multiple
    newsgroups. The proposed SEARCH command supports functionality similar to the
    [IMAP4] SEARCH command, minus user specific search keys (i.e., ANSWERED, DRAFT,
    FLAGGED, KEYWORD, NEW, OLD, RECENT, SEEN) and minus search keys based on headers
    that do not exist in news (i.e., CC, BCC, TO). The availability of the extensions
    described here will be advertised by the server using the extension negotiation-mechanism
    described in the new NNTP protocol specification currently being developed [NNTP-NEW].</p>"
