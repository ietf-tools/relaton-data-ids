abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists security threats related to IPv6 multihoming. Multihoming
    can introduce new opportunities to redirect packets to different, unintended IP
    addresses. The intent is to look at how IPv6 multihoming solutions might make
    the Internet less secure than the current Internet, without studying any proposed
    solution but instead looking at threats that are inherent in the problem itself.
    The threats in this document build upon the threats discovered and discussed as
    part of the Mobile IPv6 work.</p>"
