abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification profiles the Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client
    Authentication and Authorization Grants [RFC7521] and JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0
    Client Authentication and Authorization Grants [RFC7523] to enable the use of
    SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (SVIDs) as client credentials in OAuth 2.0.
    It defines how OAuth clients with SPIFFE credentials can authenticate to OAuth
    authorization servers using their JWT-SVIDs or X.509-SVIDs without the need for
    client secrets. This approach enhances security by enabling seamless integration
    between SPIFFE-enabled workloads and OAuth authorization servers while eliminating
    the need to distribute and manage shared secrets such as static client secrets.</p>"
