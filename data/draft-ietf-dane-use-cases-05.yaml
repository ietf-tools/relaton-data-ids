abstract:
- content: "<p>Many current applications use the certificate-based authentication
    features in Transport Layer Security (TLS) to allow clients to verify that a connected
    server properly represents a desired domain name. Typically, this authentication
    has been based on PKIX certificate chains rooted in well-known certificate authorities
    (CAs), but additional information can be provided via the DNS itself. This document
    describes a set of use cases in which the DNS and DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
    could be used to make assertions that support the TLS authentication process.
    The main focus of this document is TLS server authentication, but it also covers
    TLS client authentication for applications where TLS clients are identified by
    domain names. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
