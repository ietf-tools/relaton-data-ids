abstract:
- content: <p>Some working groups of the IETF and other Standards Developing Organizations
    are now discussing use cases of a technology that enables data packets to traverse
    appropriate service functions through networks. This is called Service Chaining
    in this document. (Also, in Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), a subject
    that forwarding packets to required service functions in appropriate order is
    called VNF Forwarding Graph.) This draft does not focus only on SFC method, and
    thus, use the term "Service Chaining". SFC may be one method to realize Service
    Chaining. There are several Service Chaining methods to forward data packets to
    service functions, and the applicable methods will vary depending on the service/network
    requirements of individual networks. This document presents the results of analyzing
    packet forwarding methods and path decision patterns for achieving Service Chaining.
    For forwarding data packets to the appropriate service functions, distribution
    of route infromation and steering data packets following the route infromation,
    are required. Examples of route information are packet identifier and the routing
    configurations based on the identifier. Also, forwarding functions are required
    to decide the path according to the route information.</p>
