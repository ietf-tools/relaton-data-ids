abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS-TP defines a packet-based network architecture and a comprehensive
    set of tools that allow service providers to reliably deliver next generation
    services and applications, in a simple, scalable, and cost-effective way. Such
    services are BW-hungry based and require strict guaranteed SLA. Delivering next
    generation services over an MPLS-TP based network in an economic way, enables
    service providers to remain competitive while increasing their revenues. This
    document presents the motivations for migrating from different legacy transport
    networks and services to MPLS-TP, and discusses the considerations and strategies
    for the migration. The document also proposes specific activities and techniques
    needed to ensure a smooth migration path from the different transport networks
    and services to MPLS-TP.</p>"
