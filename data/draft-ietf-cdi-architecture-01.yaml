abstract:
- content: "<p>There is wide interest in the technology for interconnecting Content
    Networks, variously called 'Content Peering' or 'Content Internetworking'. We
    present the general architecture and core building blocks used in the internetworking
    of Content Networks. The scope of this work is limited to external interconnections
    with Content Networks and does not address internal mechanisms used within Content
    Networks, which for the purpose of the document are considered to be black boxes.
    This work establishes an abstract architectural framework to be used in the development
    of protocols, interfaces, and system models for standardized Content Internetworking.</p>"
