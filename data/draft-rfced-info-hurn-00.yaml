abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the addressing scheme of the 'IP Network
    Address Translator (NAT) [1] could be extended. The extension takes advantage
    of the fact that the source port number in a full TCP/IP packet can be any value
    the originating host is not currently using. It also exploits the fact that (nearly)
    all the networking software will work with DNS. By using DNS and proxies the ENAT
    systems perform the address translation indirectly. For convenience the term ENAT
    will be used for the extended addressing scheme to distinguish it from the original.
    A ENAT system could be used equally for UDP/IP as well as TCP/IP. ICMP can be
    handled with restrictions.</p>"
