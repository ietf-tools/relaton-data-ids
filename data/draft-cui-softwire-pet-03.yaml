abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4 and IPv6 are expected to coexist for a long period. Currently,
    there are many IPv4/IPv6 transition/coexistence techniques, roughly divided into
    the categories of tunneling and translation. Tunneling and translation have respective
    application scopes, and translation has some technical limitations, including
    scalability issue, application layer translation, operation complexity, etc. To
    improve the availability of translation, this draft proposes the method of selecting
    appropriate translation spot to execute translation. When the translation spot
    is not on IPv4-IPv6 border, tunnel is used to achieve the traversing between translation
    spot and IP border. This method applies well in mesh scenario where both IPv4
    and IPv6 client network exists, and BGP can be extended to achieve a translation
    spot signaling.</p>"
