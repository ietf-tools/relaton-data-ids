abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how the Session Description Protocol (SDP) can
    be used to describe sessions of Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages.
    To achieve this it presents how existing SDP functionality should be utilized
    and defines two new SDP attributes. The usage of SDP for SOAP sessions within
    the Offer/Answer model is specifically discussed as this enables the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) to be used to create, modify and terminate SOAP sessions.</p>"
