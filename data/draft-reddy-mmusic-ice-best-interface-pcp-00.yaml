abstract:
- content: "<p>A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface
    for communication. Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static configuration
    and does not consider the link characteristics of that interface, which may affect
    the user experience. This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to query
    the link characteristics from the access router (the router at the other end of
    the endpoint's access link) using a Port Control Protocol (PCP) Flow Extension.
    This information influences endpoint's Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) candidate selection algorithm.</p>"
