abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Mastic, a two-party VDAF for the following
    aggregation task: each client holds a string, and the collector wishes to count
    how many of these strings begin with a given prefix. Such a VDAF can be used to
    solve the private heavy hitters problem, where the goal is to compute the subset
    of the strings that occur most frequently without learning which client holds
    which string. This document also describes different modes of operation for Mastic
    that support additional use cases and admit various performance and security trade-offs.</p>"
