abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a simple protocol for interaction between the
    PSTN and applications in the IP domain. It is not intended to be a full INAP or
    JAIN like interface, rather to easily enable some of the more common interactions
    in a way that will allow application developers, with minimal telephony knowledge,
    to quickly integrate it into new and existing applications. This document includes
    simple Java HTTP Servlets which implement some basic parts of the protocol as
    an example (note similar approaches would work for CGI also). To get a quick feel
    for the protocol go straight to the example section near the end</p>"
