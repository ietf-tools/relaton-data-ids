abstract:
- content: <p>The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allows multihoming
    by using multiple addresses. When communication between the initially chosen addresses
    for a transport session is no longer possible, a "shim" layer makes it possible
    to switch to a different set of addresses without breaking current transport protocol
    assumptions. This draft discusses the issues of detecting failures in a currently
    used address pair between two hosts ("current pair reachability") and and picking
    a new address pair to be used when a failure occurs ("full path exploration").</p>
