- content: "<p>This document describes API considerations to provide applications
    with network-supplied information about acceptable network flow rates. Since this
    information is expected to be signalled from the network within the stack below
    the application using SCONE protocol signalling, it needs to be made accessible
    to applications in order for them to pick proper video rates, or to otherwise
    confine the application behavior within network-defined limits.</p>"
