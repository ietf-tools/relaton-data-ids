abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy services are a new class of applications running on caching proxies
    or dedicated application servers, preferably at the network edge. They are described
    in [2] and [3]. Execution of proxy services is triggered by certain conditions.
    These conditions are service specific and have to be provided by the party on
    behalf of which the affected service modules are executed. The Proxy Service Rule
    Specification Language (PSRL) is an XML-based language that can be used to describe
    service specific execution rules. It allows a service provider to tell a proxy
    caching provider when and how the services should be executed.</p>"
