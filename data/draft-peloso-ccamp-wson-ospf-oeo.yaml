abstract:
- content: "<p>The original content of this internet draft was to propose some extentions
    to OSPF encoding in the context of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks, especially
    for internal constraints of optical network elements. General description can
    be found in the framework document. This update of the document still aims at
    specifying the detailled structure of OSPF LSAs for WSONs. Nevertheless, the proposed
    LSA layout slightly differs from the current content of the information model
    and encodings drafts. As a result, the following sections highlight the differences
    between both approaches and summarize why the authors think these CCAMP's drafts
    would benefit from an update according to the proposed description.</p>"
