abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Sampling and Filtering techniques for IP packet
    selection. It provides a categorization of schemes and defines what parameters
    are needed to describe the most common selection schemes. Furthermore, it shows
    how techniques can be combined to build more elaborate packet Selectors. The document
    provides the basis for the definition of information models for configuring selection
    techniques in Metering Processes and for reporting the technique in use to a Collector.
