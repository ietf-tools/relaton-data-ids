abstract:
- content: "<p>The Content Filtering Protocol (CFP) has been developed to facilitate
    the connection of content filtering databases to Internet firewall systems. CFP
    compliance allows content filters to be located 'behind the firewall,' where they
    are safe from outside hostile attack. The CFP is a binary protocol used by firewall
    systems to communicate over a private TCP/IP connection to the content filtering
    database server.</p>"
