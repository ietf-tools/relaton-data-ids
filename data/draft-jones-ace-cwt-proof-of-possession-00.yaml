abstract:
- content: <p>This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT)
    that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of- possession key
    and how the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the
    key by the presenter. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes
    described as the presenter being a holder-of-key. This specification is a profile
    of "Proof-of- Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" (RFC 7800),
    but using CBOR and CWTs rather than JSON and JWTs.</p>
