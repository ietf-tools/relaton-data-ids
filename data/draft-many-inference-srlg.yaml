abstract:
- content: "<p>The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]
    is considered as one of the most important criteria concerning the constrained-based
    path computation of optical channel routes. By applying the SRLG constraint criteria
    to the constrained-based path computation, one can select a route taking into
    account resource and logical structure disjointness that implies a lower probability
    of simultaneous lightpath failure.</p>"
