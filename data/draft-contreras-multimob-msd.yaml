abstract:
- content: "<p>A new working group, Multimob, has been chartered for providing an
    implementation of multicast service distribution to multicast listeners as they
    move in currently defined Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domains according to RFC
    5213 [1]. No protocol modifications or extensions are considered at this stage.
    Several proposals [2, 3, 4] have been already presented to face this issue. This
    contribution sums up some of the previous ideas extending them when necessary
    to overcome some limitations existing on such solutions.</p>"
