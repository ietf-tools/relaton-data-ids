abstract:
- content: "<p>The Distributed Component Object Model protocol is an application-level
    protocol for object-oriented remote procedure calls useful for distributed, component-based
    systems of all types. It is a generic protocol layered on the distributed computing
    environment (DCE) RPC specification and facilitates the construction of task-specific
    communication protocols through features such as: a platform neutral argument/parameter
    marshaling format (NDR), the ability for objects to support multiple interfaces
    with a safe, interface- level versioning scheme suited to independent evolution
    by multiple parties, the ability to make authenticated connections and to choose
    levels of channel security, and a transport-neutral data representation for references
    (including by-value) to objects.</p>"
