abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents network slicing differentiation from the non-
    partition network or from simply partition of connectivity resources. It lists
    7 standardization gaps related to 4 key requirements for network slicing in transport
    network. It also presents an analysis of existing related work and other potential
    solutions on network slicing. This gap analysis document aims to provide a basis
    for future works in transport network slicing.</p>"
