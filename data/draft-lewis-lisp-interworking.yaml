abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the Locator/ID
    Separation Protocol (LISP [LISP]) to interoperate with Internet sites not running
    LISP. A fundamental property of LISP- speaking sites is that they use Endpoint
    Identifiers (EIDs), rather than traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination
    fields of all traffic they emit or receive. While EIDs are syntactically identical
    to IP addresses, routes for them are not carried in the global routing system
    so an interoperability mechanism is needed for non-LISP-speaking sites to exchange
    traffic with LISP-speaking sites. This document introduces two such mechanisms:
    the first uses a new network element, the LISP Proxy Tunnel Router (PTR) (Section
    5) to act as a intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP- speaking
    hosts while the second adds Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality to
    LISP Ingress and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (xTRs) to substitute routable IP addresses
    for non-routable EIDs.</p>"
