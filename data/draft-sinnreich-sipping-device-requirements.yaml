abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP Telephony Device Requirements in this document are aimed to
    enable users to procure SIP phones from various vendors and install them using
    a configuration process over the network, though still allowing manual configuration
    data input if desired. SIP telephony devices are also required to be updated up
    automatically, without the intervention of the end user.</p>"
