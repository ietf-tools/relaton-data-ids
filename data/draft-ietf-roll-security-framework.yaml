abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a security framework for routing over low power
    and lossy networks (LLN). The development builds upon previous work on routing
    security and adapts the assessments to the issues and constraints specific to
    low power and lossy networks. A systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating
    the security threats and identifying applicable countermeasures. These assessments
    provide the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation into low power,
    lossy network routing protocols. As an illustration, this framework is applied
    to IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL).</p>"
