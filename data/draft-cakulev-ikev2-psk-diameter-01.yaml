abstract:
- content: <p>Internet Key Exchange is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual
    authentication as well as establishing and maintaining security associations (SAs)
    between two parties such as a user and a network entity. Internet Key Exchange
    v2 (IKEv2) protocol allows several different mechanisms for authenticating a user,
    namely the Extensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared secrets.
    To authenticate and/or authorize the user, the network element such as the Access
    Gateway may need to dynamically bootstrap a security association based on interaction
    with the Diameter server. This document specifies the interaction between the
    Access Gateway and Diameter server for the IKEv2 based on pre-shared secrets.
