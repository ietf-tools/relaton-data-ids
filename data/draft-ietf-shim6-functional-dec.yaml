abstract:
- content: "<p>In this note we will present a functional decomposition of the multihomig
    protocol i.e. the protocol for preserving established communications in multihomed
    environments. We will do so by describing a protocol walkthrough, presenting which
    functions have to be performed at each stage and the messages required to accomplish
    them. The functional decomposition presented in this draft is based on the general
    functional analysis of multihoming approaches presented in [3].</p>"
