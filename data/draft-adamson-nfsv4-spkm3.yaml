abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes a method whereby one can use GSS-API [RFC2078]
    to supply a secure channel between a user on a client and a server, authenticating
    both the user and server with public key certificates [RFC3280], without the need
    for an external Public Key Infrastructure for certificate verification. The method
    leverages the existing Simple Public Key Mechanism Version 3 (SPKM-3) [RFC2847].
    In addition to describing the use of SPKM-3 for mutual authentication, this memorandum
    updates RFC2847, reflecting implementation experience.</p>"
