abstract:
- content: "<p>Retransmission timeouts are detrimental to application latency, especially
    for short transfers such as Web transactions where timeouts can often take longer
    than all of the rest of a transaction. The primary cause of retransmission timeouts
    are lost segments at the tail of transactions. This document describes an experimental
    algorithm for TCP to quickly recover lost segments at the end of transactions
    or when an entire window of data or acknowledgments are lost. Tail Loss Probe
    (TLP) is a sender-only algorithm that allows the transport to recover tail losses
    through fast recovery as opposed to lengthy retransmission timeouts. If a connection
    is not receiving any acknowledgments for a certain period of time, TLP transmits
    the last unacknowledged segment (loss probe). In the event of a tail loss in the
    original transmissions, the acknowledgment from the loss probe triggers SACK/FACK
    based fast recovery. TLP effectively avoids long timeouts and thereby improves
    TCP performance.</p>"
