abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) protocol
    provides support for peering AAA transactions across the Internet. This document
    describes a standardized API for the Diameter protocol. The API is defined for
    the C++ language. The intent of the API is to foster source code portability across
    multiple programming platforms, leveraging the object-oriented nature of C++ and
    reusing what is already defined in the Diameter C API as much as possible. The
    C++ API can also be used as a basis to define more platform-independent API such
    as Java-based API.</p>"
