abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 relies on IPsec for securing the signaling between the
    MN and HA. However, the tight coupling of the mobility protocol with IPsec is
    detrimental to broader implementation and deployment. This document proposes a
    scheme based on Identity-Based Cryptography mechanism to authenticate the mobile
    node and signaling of home biding update to home agent. Hence, the use of IPsec
    could be avoided.</p>"
