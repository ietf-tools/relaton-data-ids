abstract:
- content: "<p>Firmware update is one of the key features for all Internet of Things(IoT)
    Devices. Incentives of firmware update is to fix bugs, upgrade configurations,
    add new services from constained devices to connected vehicles. The IETF SUIT
    working group is focusing on defining a firmware update solution that will be
    usable on Class 1 devices as well as more capable devices with existing mechanisms.
    This document provides an firmware update architechture, that aims at helping
    build a secure, automatic and interoperable IoT firmware update mechanism.</p>"
