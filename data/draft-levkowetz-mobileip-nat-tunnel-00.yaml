abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP is now being deployed, providing connectivity to mobile users.
    This is happening well ahead of the widespread use of IPv6, which may not have
    been expected at the time when the Mobile IP standard was originally formulated.
    At the same time, networks with private address spaces are proliferating, using
    NAT devices to reach the public internet. Today NATs are widely deployed in home
    gateways, as well as in other locations likely to be used by mobile users, such
    as hotels. The result is that MIP-NAT incompatibility issues have become a major
    barrier to deployment of Mobile IP in one of its principal uses. This draft describes
    a known incompatibility between NAT and Mobile IP, and also describes a possible
    solution using Mobile IP's vendor specific extensions.</p>"
