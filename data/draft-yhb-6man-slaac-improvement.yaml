abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration described by RFC4862 only
    supports 64-bit prefixes. This approach can't be deployed in the sites with prefixes
    longer than 64. We have no right to require that the sites MUST use 64-bit prefixes.
    This document tries to implement stateless address autoconfiguration with prefixes
    longer than 64.</p>"
