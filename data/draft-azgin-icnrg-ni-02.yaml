abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this proposal is to introduce the notion of network
    identifier (NI) in the ICN architecture. This is in addition to the existing names
    (i.e., content identifiers, CIs, or application identifiers, AIs, in general)
    that are currently used for both naming and routing/forwarding purposes. Network
    identifiers are needed considering the requirements on future networking architectures
    such as: (i) to support persistent names (or persistently named objects) and large-scale
    and high-speed mobility of any network entity (i.e, devices, services, and content),
    (ii) to accommodate different types of Internet of Things (IoT) services, many
    of which require low- latency performance, and enabling edge computing to support
    service virtualization, which will require support for large scale migration and
    replication of named resources, and (iii) to scale the ICN architecture to future
    Internet scale considering the exponentially increasing named entities. If information
    on AI-to-NI mappings are not directly accessible to the consumers, for instance,
    using specific datasets like manifests, these considerations may require enabling
    a name resolution service, which can be network based or application driven, to
    support efficient and scalable routing. Current document do not impose any restrictions
    on the name resolution architecture, regarding its scope. In the current draft,
    we begin by highlighting the issues associated with ICN networking when utilizing
    only the AIs, which include persistently named content, services, and devices.
    Next we discuss the function NI serves, and provide a discussion on the two current
    NI-based proposals, along with their scope and functionalities. This is with the
    objective of having a single NI construct for ICN that is flexible enough to adapt
    to different networking contexts.</p>"
