abstract:
- content: "<p>The development of two explicit routing protocols RSVP-TE[RSVP-TE]
    and CR-LDP[CR-LDP] within MPLS has created the need to allow interworking between
    the two MPLS. Explict routed (ER) label switch paths do not have a prior knowledge
    of the ER signaling method in use within the various links comprising a domain.
    In an integrated environment an ER path may crisscross between RSVP-TE and CR-LDP
    nodes numerous times. This document describes the procedures for the establishment
    of an RSVP-TE originated LSP transiting or terminating within a CR-LDP domain
    and the procedures for the establishment of a CR-LDP originated LSP terminating
    within an RSVP-TE domain.</p>"
