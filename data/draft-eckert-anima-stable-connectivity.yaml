abstract:
- content: "<p>OAM (Operations, Administration and Management) processes for data
    networks are often subject to the problem of circular dependencies when relying
    on network connectivity of the network to be managed for the OAM operations itself.
    Provisioning during device/network bring up tends to be far less easy to automate
    than service provisioning later on, changes in core network functions impacting
    reachability can not be automated either because of ongoing connectivity requirements
    for the OAM equipment itself, and widely used OAM protocols are not secure enough
    to be carried across the network without security concerns. This document describes
    how to integrate OAM processes with the autonomic control plane (ACP) in Autonomic
    Networks (AN). to provide stable and secure connectivity for those OAM processes.</p>"
