    protocols for communicating with I/O devices, especially storage devices. iSCSI
    is a proposed transport protocol for SCSI that operates on top of TCP[4]. The
    iSCSI Boot Draft[5] is an informational draft that provides information on the
    mechanisms employed by an iSCSI boot client to locate and boot off an iSCSI boot
    server. This memo describes the mechanism by which an iSCSI boot client can obtain
    the identity of an iSCSI boot server using the DHCP service.</p>"
