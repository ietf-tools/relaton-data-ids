abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the ChaMeLeon (CML) routing protocol designed
    for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) supporting emergency communications. CML is
    a hybrid and adaptive routing protocol operating within a defined disaster area
    denoted as the Critical Area (CA). The main concept behind CML is the adaptability
    of its routing mechanisms towards changes in the physical and logical state of
    a MANET. For autonomous emergency communications, there is a likelihood that the
    network size will vary whenever more rescuers join or leave the network. In addition,
    battery exhaustion of lightweight mobile communication devices used by rescuers
    could stipulate another reason for changes in the network size. Hence, this version
    of CML adapts its routing behavior according to changes in the network size within
    a pre-defined CA. For small networks, CML routes data proactively using the Optimized
    Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol whereas for larger networks it utilizes the
    reactive Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol so that overall
    routing performance is improved. These transitions occur via the CML oscillation
    phase. This document focuses on the description of the processes involved in the
    CML Cognitive and Adaptive Module (CAM), CML Oscillation phase and transition
    between phases.</p>"
