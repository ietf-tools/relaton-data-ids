abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a change to the OSPF Point-to-Point Interface, for
    the express purpose of describing and routing through a many-branched star topology.
    The principal near term user of this is the frame relay interface, but the concept
    is applicable to any multi-point interface, and especially useful in those that
    otherwise require a large number of small subnets to represent in the existing
    NBMA scheme.</p>"
