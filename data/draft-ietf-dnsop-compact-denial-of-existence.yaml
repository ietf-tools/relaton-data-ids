abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a technique to generate a signed DNS response
    on demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists but doesn't
    have any data for the queried record type. Such answers require only one minimal
    NSEC record, allow online signing servers to minimize signing operations and response
    sizes, and prevent zone content disclosure.</p>"
