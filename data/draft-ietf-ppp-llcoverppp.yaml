abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the operation of the LLC protocol over PPP. The
    Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a method for transmitting datagrams over
    serial point-to-point links. PPP is composed of three parts: 1) A method for encapsulating
    datagrams over serial links. 2) An extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP). 3)
    A family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different
    network layer protocols. The PPP encapsulating scheme, the basic LCP, and an NCP
    for controlling and establishing the Internet Protocol (IP) (called the IP Control
    Protocol, IPCP) are defined in RFC 1171 ``The Point-to-Point Protocol for the
    Transmission of Multi-Protocol Datagrams Over Point-to-Point Links''. IEEE 802.2
    Logical Link Control (LLC) protocol provides additional services beyond those
    available directly from the various IEEE 802 Medium Access Control (MAC) data
    link protocols.</p>"
