abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) provides two bits in the IP
    header for routers to signal congestion to endpoints without resorting to packet
    loss. RFC6040 provided guidance for how IP-in-IP tunnels should transfer (ECN)
    markings between inner and outer IP headers. However, that document implicitly
    assumes that no more than one inner packet is present in an outer packet. As numerous
    tunneling technologies have since emerged that break this assumption, further
    guidance is needed.</p>"
