abstract:
- content: "<p>NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range
    of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a storage networking
    fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and InfiniBand. For Ethernet-based network,
    RDMA or TCP technology can be used to transport NVMe, but the network management
    mechanism is simple, and fault detection is weak. This document describes the
    solution requirements for automatic device discovery to improve usability and
    quick switchover to improve reliability.</p>"
