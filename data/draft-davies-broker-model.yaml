abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet is increasingly being used for commercial and industrial
    purposes which, apart from causing an explosion in traffic, will require that
    the future network provides a highly efficient 'on-demand' service. The provision
    of an efficient on-demand service will require Internet 'sessions' to use virtual-message-paths
    that must be opened and closed in a manner similar to the establishment of calls
    in a telephone network; enabling the network to refuse traffic which exceeds the
    available capacity and ensuring that established sessions will not be violated.
    It is felt that the RSVP mechanism will not fully meet these requirements for
    the commercial services described below, and this paper describes an alternative.</p>"
