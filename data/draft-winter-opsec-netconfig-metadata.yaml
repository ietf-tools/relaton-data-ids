abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a YANG module for transfering configuration
    information of deployments of network services towards leaf nodes (hosts) on the
    internet. Such configuration files are meant to be discovered, consumed and used
    by configuration agents on the host to achieve correct and secure setup of these
    services on the consuming device. This iteration of the I-D concentrates on Wi-Fi
    network setup and EAP credentials, but is extensible to cover a wide range including
    VPN, E-Mail and other services.</p>"
