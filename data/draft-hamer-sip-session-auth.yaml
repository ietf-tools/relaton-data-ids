abstract:
- content: "<p>Current proposals dealing with authorization of media streams for multimedia
    services like IP telephony and video assume a pre- established relationship between
    elements of the network (e.g. session managers, edge routers, policy servers and
    end hosts). In some environments, however, such pre-established relationships
    may not exist either due to the complexity of creating these associations a priori
    (e.g. in a network with many elements), or due to the different business entities
    involved (e.g. service provider and access provider), or due to the dynamic nature
    of these associations (e.g. in a mobile environment). In this document, we describe
    scenarios where there is no pre- established relationship between entities and
    describe mechanisms for exchanging information between network elements in order
    to authorize the use of resources for a service and to co-ordinate actions between
    the session and bearer control planes.</p>"
