abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4 (BGP-4) finite state machine
    (FSM) is defined in RFC 4271. Over the years, various extensions to BGP have been
    authored that update the protocol's FSM. Some elements of the FSM are enumerated.
    Those elements are referred to across BGP extensions in their respective state
    machine changes, and may also be used for management purposes in things such as
    YANG. To provide consistent naming and enumeration of these FSM elements, this
    draft requests IANA to create and maintain registries for elements in the BGP
    FSM.</p>"
