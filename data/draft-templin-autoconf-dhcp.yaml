abstract:
- content: "<p>Enterprise networks connect routers over various link types, and may
    also connect to provider networks and/or the global Internet. Enterprise network
    nodes require a means to automatically provision IP addresses/prefixes and support
    internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including Small Office,
    Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), multi-organizational
    corporate networks and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself. This
    document specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for autoconfiguration
    and operation of nodes in enterprise networks. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
