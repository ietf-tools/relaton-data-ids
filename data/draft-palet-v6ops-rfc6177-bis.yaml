abstract:
- content: "<p>The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) policies have different views
    regarding the recommendation of the prefix to be assigned to end- sites. However,
    all them allow up to a /48 without further justification and clearly state that
    the exact choice of how much address space should be assigned to end-sites is
    a decision of each operator. This document reviews the architectural and operational
    considerations of end-site assignments, and reiterates that assignment policy
    and guidelines belong to the RIR community. This revision is being made to emphasize
    that IPv6 protocol evolution requires an ever-increasing availability of subnets
    at the end-site, so policy should reflect that assignment of a single subnet is
    never recommended. This document obsoletes RFC6177 (IPv6 Address Assignment to
    End Sites).</p>"
