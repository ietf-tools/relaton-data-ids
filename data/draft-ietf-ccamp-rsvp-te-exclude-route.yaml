abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies ways to communicate route exclusions during
    path setup using Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).
    The RSVP-TE specification, "RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels" (RFC
    3209) and GMPLS extensions to RSVP-TE, "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
    Extensions" (RFC 3473) allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly included
    in a path setup, but not to be explicitly excluded. In some networks where precise
    explicit paths are not computed at the head end, it may be useful to specify and
    signal abstract nodes and resources that are to be explicitly excluded from routes.
    These exclusions may apply to the whole path, or to parts of a path between two
    abstract nodes specified in an explicit path. How Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs)
    can be excluded is also specified in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
