abstract:
- content: "<p>Given the ever-increasing importance of configuration tasks for the
    provisioning of a wide range of IP resources, networks, and services in today's
    Internet, this draft aims at listing the basic requirements that should drive
    the specification of a protocol to convey configuration information towards network
    devices. This memo doesn't aim at listing candidate protocols to convey such information,
    nor at choosing one of these. This draft basically describes a whole set of issues
    a service provider has to deal with, hence a list of requirements to better address
    such issues.</p>"
