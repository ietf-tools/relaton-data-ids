abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an initial framework and discussion of the problem
    of transferring middlebox (for example, firewall or NAT) flow-coupled state from
    one middlebox to another while the flow is still active. This has most recently
    come up in the context of virtual machine (VM) migration between hypervisors,
    but it is a problem that has appeared in other situations, as well. We present
    some of the parameters of the problem, define some language for discussing the
    problem, and begin to identify a path forward for addressing it.</p>"
