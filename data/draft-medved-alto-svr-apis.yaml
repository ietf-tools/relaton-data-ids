abstract:
- content: "<p>ALTO servers require automated operation, where the topology of the
    underlying networks is incorporated into network maps automatically. In addition
    to the Client-to-Server API defined in the ALTO protocol document, two more standardized
    API are required: an API between the ALTO Server and networking nodes (e.g. routers),
    through which the ALTO Server can get topology information from the network, and
    an API between the ALTO Servers, through which they can exchange topology and
    status information between themselves.</p>"
