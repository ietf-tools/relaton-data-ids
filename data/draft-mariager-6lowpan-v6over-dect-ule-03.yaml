abstract:
- content: "<p>DECT Ultra Low Energy is a low power air interface technology that
    is defined by the DECT Forum and specified by ETSI. The DECT air interface technology
    has been used world-wide in communication devices for more than 15 years, primarily
    carrying voice for cordless telephony but has also been deployed for data centric
    services. The DECT Ultra Low Energy is a recent addition to the DECT interface
    primarily intended for low-bandwidth, low-power applications such as sensor devices,
    smart meters, home automation etc. As the DECT Ultra Low Energy interface inherits
    many of the capabilities from DECT, it benefits from long range, interference
    free operation, world wide reserved frequency band, low silicon prices and maturity.
    There is an added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE
    such as for Internet of Things applications. This document describes how IPv6
    is transported over DECT ULE using 6LoWPAN techniques.</p>"
