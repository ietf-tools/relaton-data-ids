abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management protocol
    that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any
    mobility-related signaling. PMIPv6 requires all communications to go through the
    local mobility anchor. As this can be suboptimal, Localized Routing (LR) allows
    Mobile Nodes (MNs) attached to the same or different Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs)
    to route traffic by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the
    gateways. This document proposes initiation, utilization, and termination mechanisms
    for localized routing between mobile access gateways within a proxy mobile IPv6
    domain. It defines two new signaling messages, Localized Routing Initiation (LRI)
    and Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA), that are used to realize this mechanism.
