abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 hosts typically configure and use a number of addresses of different
    scope and stability properties. Recent work has analyzed the security and privacy
    implications of IPv6 addressing, and improved the security and privacy properties
    of some of the aforementioned address types. However, advice is still missing
    guidance regarding which address properties are desirable in different scenarios,
    and how such addresses should be used when they are configured. This document
    complements the aforementioned work by providing advice regarding which address
    types to configure and how to employ them in a number of popular scenarios.</p>"
