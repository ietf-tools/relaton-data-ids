abstract:
- content: "<p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP. When MPLS Labels
    are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an MPLS VPN, the packet
    header is typically 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30
    bytes, for example. Header compression can significantly reduce the overhead through
    various compression mechanisms. MPLS is used to route header-compressed (HC) packets
    over an MPLS LSP without compression/decompression cycles at each router. Such
    an HC over MPLS capability increases the bandwidth efficiency as well as processing
    scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous compressed flows that use HC
    at each router. MPLS pseudowires are used to transport the HC context and other
    control messages between the ingress and egress MPLS label switched router (LSR),
    and the pseudowires define a point to point instance of each HC session at the
    header decompressor. Standard HC methods (e.g., ECRTP, ROHC, etc.) are re-used
    to determine the context.</p>"
