abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the BDP_FRAME extension for QUIC. The frame
    enables the exchange of Congestion Control (CC) parameters related to the path
    characteristics between the receiver and the sender during a connection. These
    CC parameters can be utilised by the Careful Resume method when a new connection
    is established or for application-limited traffic. The CC parameters allows a
    receiver to prepare to use the additional capacity that could be made available
    when the method is used. This CC parameters can also be used by the receiver to
    request that previously computed CC parameters related to the path characteristics,
    are not used, when the receiver has additional information about the path or traffic
    to be sent.</p>"
