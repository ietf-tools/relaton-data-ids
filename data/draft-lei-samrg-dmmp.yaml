abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Dynamic Mesh-based overlay Multicast Protocol
    (DMMP) framework to support multicast data delivery applications without relying
    on classic IP multicast, including multicast group management, overlay hierarchy
    establishment, multicast tree construction and data forwarding scheme from a source
    to a number of receivers. The DMMP framework builds on control plane functions
    which dynamically manage an overlay core and a multicast tree. The key idea is
    a number of end hosts self-organize into an overlay mesh, and dynamically maintain
    such a mesh. Based on the constructed mesh, some core-based clusters are formed
    with capacity- aware trees inside. Then, a multicast tree consisting of DMMP-aware
    end hosts (and/or specific routers) is built on the top of the overlay core for
    the efficient delivery of the multicast data.</p>"
