abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
    (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6. It is based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined
    in RFC 3768 and in "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6", and obsoletes
    the prevision specification of this version documented in RFC 5798. VRRP specifies
    an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a Virtual Router
    to one of the VRRP Routers on a LAN. The VRRP Router controlling the IPv4 or IPv6
    address(es) associated with a Virtual Router is called the Active Router, and
    it forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Active Routers are configured
    with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the address family
    of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the IP protocol version. Within
    a VRRP Router, the Virtual Routers in each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families
    are independent of one another and always treated as separate Virtual Router instances.
    The election process provides dynamic failover in the forwarding responsibility
    should the Active Router become unavailable. For IPv4, the advantage gained from
    using VRRP is a higher-availability default path without requiring configuration
    of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host. For IPv6,
    the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switchover to Backup
    Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.
    The VRRP terminology has been updated to conform to inclusive language guidelines
    for IETF technologies. The IETF has designated National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) "Guidance for NIST Staff on Using Inclusive Language in
    Documentary Standards" for its inclusive language guidelines.</p>
