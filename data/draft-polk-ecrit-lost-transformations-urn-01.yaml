abstract:
- content: <p>This document creates a new top level service URN for transformations
    to be used by location-to-service translation protocol (LoST) to convert similar
    values into a different format of choice. Within this 'transformations' URN, there
    are two sub-elements specifically created for geocoding and reverse geocoding
    location formats by this document. Legal This documents and the information contained
    therein are provided on an "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION
