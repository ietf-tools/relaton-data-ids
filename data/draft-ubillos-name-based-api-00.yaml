abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, networked applications typically make use of name-oriented network
    abstractions. There is a myriad of application development frameworks who provide
    abstracted APIs allowing applications to refer to their peers by name. These abstractions
    normally only provide application-layer protocol functionality. They are normally
    uni- lateral solutions, the support for the protocol used is implied by the service
    accessed on the remote peer(s). We suggest a unified API for networked applications.
    Isomorphic to the existing name-based solutions, but with added network-related
    functionality. Providing an existing application-layer protocols with network
    features such as mobility, multi-homing, IPv4/IPv6 interoperability, NAT-traversal
    and so on...</p>"
