abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network
    into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes, structures, and functions
    so that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or customers. Network
    slices need to operate in parallel with varying degrees of isolation while providing
    slice elasticity in terms of network resource allocation. The Differentiated Service
    (Diffserv) model allows for carrying multiple services on top of a single physical
    network by relying on compliant nodes to apply specific forwarding treatments
    on to packets that carry the respective Diffserv code point. This document proposes
    a solution based on the Diffserv model to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS networks.
    The proposed solution is agnostic to the path control technology used in the network
    slicing domain and allows service differentiation of traffic within a given network
    slice.</p>"
