abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER-TE) shares
    part of architecture, definition and packet format with Bit Index Explicit Replication
    (BIER) according to the introduction in [I-D.eckert-bier-te-arch]. But BIER-TE
    supports the traffic engineering by explicit hop-by-hop forwarding and loose hop
    forwarding of packets. This document proposes a set of extensions to realize the
    BIER-TE forwarding including the assignment of BitPositions to adjacencies and
    the configuration of Bit Index Forwarding Table (BIFT).</p>"
