abstract:
- content: "<p>The increasing importance of messaging as a potential source of revenue
    for mobile networks has led operators to build or procure mobile messaging solutions.
    Some operators have built mobile messaging solutions using IETF standards (IMAP,
    SMTP, MIME). Another solution has been developed by consensus in the 3GPP and
    OMA groups, based on MIME, HTTP methods and WAP PUSH, which has been deployed
    by many operators. This document presents a taxonomy of messaging architecture
    components and models, providing a comparison of their feature sets. It also identifies
    the commonalities of these mobile messaging solutions and abstracts from these
    a set of mobile messaging requirements. The information is provided to inform
    and encourage future discussion of and improvements to Internet messaging in order
    to increase their applicability to mobile messaging systems.</p>"
