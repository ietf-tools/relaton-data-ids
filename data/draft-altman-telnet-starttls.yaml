abstract:
- content: "<p>Telnet service has long been a standard Internet protocol. However,
    a standard way of ensuring privacy and integrity of Telnet sessions has been lacking.
    This document proposes a standard method for Telnet servers and clients to use
    the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It describes how two Telnet participants
    can decide whether or not to attempt TLS negotiation, and how the two participants
    should process authentication credentials exchanged as a part of TLS startup.</p>"
