abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes protocol support, in the form of LDAP controls,
    for compound entries. A compound entry logically allows collections of attributes
    to be grouped together as though they were present in the single compound entry,
    whereas in fact they are held in a hierarchical set of entries beneath the compound
    entry. The LDAP controls allow the user to treat a compound entry as either separate
    entries or as a single compound entry when both searching, retrieving and deleting
    information from the DIT. Compound entries are briefly described here and a full
    description of them can be found in the draft version of X.500 (2000)[FPDAM].</p>"
