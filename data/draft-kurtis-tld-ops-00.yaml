abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet is today the defacto standard packet network for a lot
    of critical communications. The Internet in turn have a heavy dependency on the
    Domain Name System (DNS) for it's "normal" operations. The IETF in June 2000 described
    the operating requirements [1]for the so called root-servers that defines the
    root of the DNS lookup tree. Similar requirements could where deemed needed be
    applied to DNS infrastructure at other levels of the DNS tree as well. This document
    analyses these requirements and what can be done to ensure a reliable DNS infrastructure.</p>
