abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the network-based mobility support for dual stack
    mobile nodes moving into an IPv4-only or an IPv6-only subnetwork within a NETLMM
    domain. This memo also presents a network-based global mobility management protocol
    with support of IPv4-IPv6 traversal. By utilizing this document, mobile nodes
    can move from an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack localized domain to an IPv6-only (or IPv4-only)
    localized domain without any IP session disruption.</p>"
