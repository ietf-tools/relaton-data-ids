abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence Protocol is designed to maintain presence information
    about a potentially large number of online users connected through various Points
    of Presence (PoPs), and belonging to several Federations (which are collections
    of uniformly administered entities). The Presence Protocol meets several of the
    requirements for a Presence Information Protocol [PIP-Req] in a simple, direct
    fashion. (Issues around security of messages are deliberately excluded from this
    draft.) The Presence Protocol is related to the [PIP-Demo] protocol. It differs
    from it in introducing a notion of Points of Presence, mediating between the Presence
    Server and user agents (clients) and specifys a mechanism for a user to control
    the dissemination of their own presence information. It is substantially simpler,
    doing away with leases (in favor of pings), eliminating redirections, and eliminating
    the dependence on an HTTP-style transport protocol. Further, it leaves for a separate
    protocol, the Messaging Protocol, the task of defining how Instant Messages should
    be communicated between points of presence.</p>"
