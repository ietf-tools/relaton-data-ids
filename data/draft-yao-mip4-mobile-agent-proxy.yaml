abstract:
- content: "<p>In some networks such as xDSL networks with WiFi extension, the periodical
    transmission of Agent Advertisements (AA) by mobility agents is used by Mobile
    Nodes (MN) to detect movement. To allow fast movement detection, the interval
    at which AAs are sent should not be long. In the early deployment of Mobile IPv4
    (MIPv4), mobility agents are deployed in the edge network. For example, in xDSL
    networks, Home Agents (HA) and Foreign Agents (FA) are located on or beside Edge
    Routers (ER) that usually serves thousands of MNs (typically between 2000 and
    5000 in xDSL networks). The periodical transmission of multicast AA to MNs in
    such a large network consumes a significant amount of the aggregation network
    bandwidth and CPU resources of ERs. This is a practical problem in xDSL networks
    with WiFi extension. This is also a common problem for others access networks
    in which a large layer-2 network is served by one router. Hence a Mobility Agent
    Discovery proxy (MADP) can be set in access nodes to make the MNs detect movement
    fast meanwhile avoiding CPU and network bandwidth consumption in the aggregation
    network. The MADP acts as a proxy to MNs as far as agent discovery is concerned
    allowing for AS issued by MNs to be locally replied according to AA issued by
    HA/FA on the access network. MADP is a logical function that can be placed on
    a suitable node location depending on access network technology and architecture
    (i.e. WiMAX) to reduce network resource cost related to agent discovery.</p>"
