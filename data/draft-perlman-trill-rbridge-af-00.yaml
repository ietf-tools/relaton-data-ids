abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL protocol provides optimal pair-wise data forwarding
    without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops,
    and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes
    this by using IS-IS link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header
    that includes a hop count. Devices that implement TRILL are called RBridges. TRILL
    supports multi-access LAN links that can have multiple end stations and RBridges
    attached. Where multiple RBridges are attached to a link, native traffic to and
    from end stations on that link is handled by a subset of those RBridges called
    Appointed Forwarders, with the intent that native traffic in each VLAN be handled
    by at most one RBridge. The purpose of this document is to improve the documentation
    of the Appointed Forwarder mechanism.</p>"
