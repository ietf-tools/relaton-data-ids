abstract:
- content: <p>This document captures the problem statement for the Softwires Working
    Group, which is developing standards for the discovery, control, and encapsulation
    methods for connecting IPv4 networks across IPv6-only networks as well as IPv6
    networks across IPv4-only networks. The standards will encourage multiple, inter-operable
    vendor implementations by identifying, and extending where necessary, existing
    standard protocols to resolve a selected set of "IPv4/IPv6" and "IPv6/IPv4" transition
    problems. This document describes the specific problems ("Hubs and Spokes" and
    "Mesh") that will be solved by the standards developed by the Softwires Working
    Group. Some requirements (and non-requirements) are also identified to better
    describe the specific problem scope. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
