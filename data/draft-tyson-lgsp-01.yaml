abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the Lightweight GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite
    System) Support Protocol (LGSP). The Lightweight GNSS Support Protocol (LGSP)
    is being developed in order to provide a comprehensive solution which solves the
    problems inherent in traditional radio-based Differential GPS (DGPS) protocols.
    LGSP will also provide additional support for GNSS user equipment, such as a GPS
    almanac retrieval method, allowing compatible units to perform faster almanac
    acquisition, thus resulting in less time until an initial position measurement
    can be established. Other supporting features include alternative distribution
    of GPS navigation messages and differential correction messages, a hierarchical
    mirroring architecture, redundant backup operation and load balancing functions.</p>"
