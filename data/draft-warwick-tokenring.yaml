abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains an extract from the approved text of IEEE standard
    802.5R ''Dedicated Token Ring''. The extract comprises the Interface MIB for the
    Dedicated Token Ring interface, in SNMPv2 format. There are no changes to the
    MIB from the Draft 7 version. 802.5R is a standard that encompasses the existing
    802.5 token- passing method of operation, and also defines a new duplex method
    of operation for use only on dedicated point to point links, that does not use
    tokens for data transmission.</p>"
