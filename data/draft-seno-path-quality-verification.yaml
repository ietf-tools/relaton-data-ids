abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a framework for path quality verification over
    an all-optical network. Because it will be difficult to ensure quality of a dynamically
    established path over an all-optical network, it may be useful for network providers
    to have means to verify quality of a path before it is served to the subscribers.
    This draft proposes a framework for such means, including requirements behind
    them and a path continuity check mechanism to verify optical-level path quality
    upon a path's establishment by the GMPLS signaling.</p>"
