abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to the Remote Authentication Dial-
    In User Service (RADIUS) protocol for supporting the 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP) 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G- AKA) authentication method.
    The 5G-AKA protocol is a key authentication method used in 5G networks for mutual
    authentication and key derivation between user devices and the network. By integrating
    5G-AKA into RADIUS, enterprises can leverage existing RADIUS-based authentication
    infrastructure for authenticating 5G devices.</p>"
