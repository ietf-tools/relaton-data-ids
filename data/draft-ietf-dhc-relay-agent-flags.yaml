abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a new suboption of the Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP) relay agent information option that allows the DHCP relay to specify
    flags for the forwarded packet. One flag is defined to indicate whether the DHCP
    relay received the packet via a unicast or broadcast packet. This information
    may be used by the DHCP server to better serve clients based on whether their
    request was originally broadcast or unicast. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
