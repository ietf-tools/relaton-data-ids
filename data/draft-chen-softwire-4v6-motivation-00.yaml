abstract:
- content: "<p>The growth of Internet obliged to accelerate IPv6 deployment. IPv6-
    only network likely become prevalent due to low costs and higher efficiency for
    operators to employ. Meanwhile, a significant part of network will still stay
    in IPv4 for long time. Regarding IPv4 depletion, address sharing mode should be
    deployed in small segmented IPv4 networks. Operators expect 4via6 solution with
    low capital and operational expense by balancing tradeoff between simple core
    network and edge-distributed management. This memo discusses several motivations,
    and it recommends the 4via6 stateless solution should be specified for deployment
    models in the guideline document.</p>"
