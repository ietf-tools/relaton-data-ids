abstract:
- content: "<p>A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
    varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss, etc. Some
    new emerging applications (e.g. 5G) have very demanding performance requirements.
    However, in current networks, the network and applications are decoupled, that
    is, the network is not aware of the applications' requirements in a fine granularity.
    Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granularity traffic operations
    for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements. This document proposes
    a new framework, named Application-aware IPv6 Networking (APN6), which makes use
    of IPv6 encapsulation to convey the application characteristic information such
    as application identification and its network performance requirements into the
    network to facilitate service provisioning, perform application-level traffic
    steering and network resource adjustment.</p>"
