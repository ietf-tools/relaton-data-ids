abstract:
- content: "<p>The Software Defined Networking paradigm proposes the separation of
    the control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its logical centralization
    on a control entity. All the network intelligence is moved to this central entity.
    Typically, such central entity is seen as a compendium of interacting control
    functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion. The relocation of the control
    functions from a number of distributed network nodes to a logical central entity
    conceptually places together a number of control capabilities with different purposes.
    As a consequence, the existing solutions do not provide a clear separation between
    services and transport control. This document describes a new proposal named Cooperating
    Layered Architecture for SDN. The idea behind that is to differentiate the control
    functions associated to transport from those related to services, in such a way
    that they can be provided and maintained independently, and can follow their own
    evolutionary way.</p>"
