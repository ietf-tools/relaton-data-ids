abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a Credential Service that uses a SIP subscribe/
    notify mechanism to discover other users' certificates and credentials and be
    notified about changes to these certificates. Other user agents that want to contact
    that AOR can retrieve these certificates from the server. The result is that widespread
    deployment of S/MIME in SIP is possible, because no extra expense or effort is
    required of the end user. This work is being discussed on the sipping@ietf.org
    mailing list.</p>"
