abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to inform how Internet protocols and their implementations
    might better mitigate technical attacks at the user endpoint by describing technology-based
    practices to perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is a pervasive reality
    that is not limited to, but can be exacerbated with, the usage of technology.
    The IPV context enables the attacker to access one, some or all of: devices, local
    networks, authentication mechanisms, identity information, and accounts. These
    kinds of technical compromise exist in addition to on-path attacks, both active
    and passive [RFC7624]. In this document we describe the tactics the IPV attacker
    uses and what kind of counter-measures can be designed in IETF protocols.</p>"
