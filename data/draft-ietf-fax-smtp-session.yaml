abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an extension to SMTP which provides a mechanism for
    requesting immediate message delivery over SMTP instead of normal store-and-forward
    delivery. It also provides a mechanism for querying the SMTP server if immediate
    delivery was successful, is still in progress, or was simply queued as a normal
    store-and-forward message.</p>"
