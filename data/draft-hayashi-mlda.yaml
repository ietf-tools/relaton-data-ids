abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a multicast CDN (Content Delivery Network) issues,
    and describes requirement and discussion points when we solve them. Here, we need
    a method of precise user accounting (logging) of a user activity to a multicast
    group and of user access control to a multicast group to protect to subscribe
    from an illegal access. In this case, it is needed to authorize a user access
    to a multicast group on the CDN, and to get information of user action (Join/Leave)
    to a multicast group. The key is how a control process of group membership synchronizes
    with an AAA process (authentication, authorization and accounting), because we
    can get a user access information at an AAA server. This depends on the network
    model of the multicast CDN service. Last of all, we introduce an example of solution
    MLDA (Multicast Listener Discovery Authentication protocol).</p>"
