abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7368 'IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles' section 3.7
    describes architecture principles related to naming and service discovery in residential
    home networks. Customer Edge Routers and other Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs)
    are designed to provide IP connectivity to home networks. Most CPEs assign IP
    addresses to the nodes of the home network which makes them good candidates for
    hosting the naming service. IPv6 provides global connectivity, and nodes from
    the home network will be reachable from the global Internet. As a result, the
    naming service is expected to be exposed on the Internet. However, CPEs have not
    been designed to host such a naming service exposed on the Internet. Running a
    naming service visible on the Internet may expose the CPEs to resource exhaustion
    and other attacks, which could make the home network unreachable, and most probably
    would also affect the internal communications of the home network. In addition,
    regular end users may not understand, or possess the necessary skills to be able
    to perform, DNSSEC management and configuration. Misconfiguration may also result
    in naming service disruption, thus these end users may prefer to rely on third
    party name service providers. This document describes a homenet naming architecture,
    where the CPEs manage the DNS zones associated with its own home network, and
    outsource elements of the naming service (possibly including DNSSEC management)
    to a third party running on the Internet.</p>"
