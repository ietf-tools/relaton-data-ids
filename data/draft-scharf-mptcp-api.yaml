abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths to
    a regular TCP session. Even though it is designed to be totally backward compatible
    to applications, the data transport differs compared to regular TCP, and there
    are several additional degrees of freedom that applications may wish to exploit.
    This document summarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such
    as changes in performance. Furthermore, it discusses compatibility issues of MPTCP
    in combination with non-MPTCP-aware applications. Finally, the document describes
    a basic application interface for MPTCP-aware applications that provides access
    to multipath address information and a level of control equivalent to regular
    TCP.</p>"
