abstract:
- content: "<p>SDP is a byte-stream transport protocol that closely mimics TCP's stream
    semantics. SDP utilizes iWARP's advanced protocol offload, kernel bypass, and
    zero copy capabilities. Because of this, SDP can have lower CPU and memory bandwidth
    utilization when compared to conventional implementations of sockets over TCP,
    while preserving the familiar byte-stream oriented semantics upon which most current
    network applications depend.</p>"
