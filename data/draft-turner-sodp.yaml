abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Secure Object Delivery Protocol (SODP).
    SODP enables clients to obtain secured packages from a Secure Object Management
    System (SOMS). Packages supported by a SOMS server include but are not limited
    to: firmware packages [RFC4108], trust anchor (TA) packages [RFC5934], symmetric
    key packages [RFC6031], asymmetric key packages [RFC5958], encrypted key packages
    [RFC6031], public key certificate enrollment packages [RFC5272], public key certificates
    [RFC5280], and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) [RFC5280]. Client access is
    ideally direct and web-based, but access via agents acting on behalf of clients
    is supported.</p>"
