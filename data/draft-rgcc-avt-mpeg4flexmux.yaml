abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an RTP payload format for the transportation
    of encoded and multiplexed MPEG-4 streams. MPEG-4 is a standard whose aims are
    to define a generic way to code natural or synthetic scenes. MPEG-4, among other
    things, supports a normative interface to Intel- lectual Property Management and
    Protection Systems. MPEG-4 also gives methods to synchronise and multiplex several
    MPEG-4 encoded streams. RTP, on the other hand, is a protocol that has been especially
    writ- ten for multimedia stream over the IP network, and to use RTP for the carriage
    of MPEG-4 data does make sense, enabling such applica- tions as Video on demand
    or Multicast Teleconferencing.</p>"
