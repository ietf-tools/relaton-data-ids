abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new inter-domain multicast forwarding (IDMF)
    mechanism for PIM-SM multicast routing protocol. Although there have been various
    inter-domain multicast routing and forwarding protocols, they still have a limitation
    for handling policy routing, QoS routing, accounting and security, which network
    administrators are willing to use in their network. In order to solve this limitation,
    we propose a novel approach to create an inter-domain multicast forwarding tree
    (or routing table) among multiple PIM-SM domains with logical unicast paths over
    which multicast packets are forwarded or flooded. The logical unicast paths are
    created by either IP-in-IP tunneling method, IP masquerade-like method, and MPLS
    label switched path (LSP) method, which can easily reuse policy routing and QoS
    routing for unicast routing. These logical unicast paths are established among
    IDMF capable nodes or proxies, which are located within each PIM-SM domain, either
    manually or by a dynamic IDMP tree construction protocol. The IDMP capable nodes
    can also behave a proxy sender of multicast packets. It can prevent a multicast
    receiver from changing a RP-tree into a global SP-tree, and also can help to reduce
    virtually the number of multicast sources for a particular multicast group. This
    property can be effectively used for accounting, security and scalability enhancement
    required for interdomain communication. The proposed mechanism is a general framework
    for inter-domain multicast forwarding and can be also used as a MSDP based forwarding
    mechanism.</p>"
