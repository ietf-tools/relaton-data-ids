abstract:
- content: <p>This memo explain requirements, benefits and feasibility of a new DetNet
    service function tentatively called "flow interleaving". It proposes to introduce
    this service function into the DetNet architecture. Flow interleaving can be understood
    as a DetNet equivalent of the IEEE TSN timed gates. Its primary role is intended
    to be at the ingress edge of DetNet domains supporting higher utilization and
    lower bounded latency for flow aggregation (interleaving of flows into a single
    flow), as well as higher utilization and lower bounded latency for interleaving
    occurring in transit hops of the DetNet domain in conjunction with in-time per-hop
    bounded latency forwarding mechanisms.</p>
