abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes TIPC, a protocol intended to be used as a TML
    (Transport Mapping Layer) for the ForCES protocol[ForCES] when that protocol is
    transported over L2 carriers such as Ethernet, RapidIO or PCI-Express. TIPC is
    specially designed for efficient communication within clusters of loosely coupled
    nodes, and may as such even be used outside the context of being a ForCES protocol
    carrier. It would even be an excellent candidate as a ForCES pre-association phase
    setup protocol.</p>"
