abstract:
- content: '<p>Deploying a new network device often requires that an employee physically
    travel to a datacenter to perform the initial install and configuration, even
    in shared datacenters with "smart-hands" type support. In many cases, this could
    be avoided if there were a standard, secure way to initially provision the devices.
    This document extends existing auto-install / Zero-Touch Provisioning mechanisms
    to make the process more secure. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is
    additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general
    musings, etc. They will be removed before publication. This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft- wkumari-opsawg-sdi.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. ] [ Ed note: This document
    introduces concepts and serves as the basic for discussion - because of this,
    it is conversational, and would need to be firmed up before being published ]</p>'
