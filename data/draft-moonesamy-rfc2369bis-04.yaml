abstract:
- content: <p>The mailing list command specification and identification header fields
    are a set of structured fields to be added to email messages sent by email distribution
    lists. Command header fields typically contain URIs (usually including "mailto")
    locating the relevant information or performing the command directly. The three
    core command header fields described in this document are List-Help, List- Subscribe,
    and List-Unsubscribe. There are three other header fields described here which,
    although not as widely applicable, will have utility for a sufficient number of
    mailing lists to justify their formalization here. These are List-Post, List-Owner
    and List-Archive. By including these header fields, mailing list managers can
    make it possible for mail user agents to provide automated tools for users to
    perform list functions.</p>
