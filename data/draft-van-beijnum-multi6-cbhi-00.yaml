abstract:
- content: "<p>Abstract This memo specifies a 64-bit crypto-based host identifier
    that can be used as an interface identifier in protocols that allow address agility,
    such as [ODT]. The cryptographic nature of the host identifier makes it possible
    to determine whether a correspondent is legitimately using said host identifier
    or not. The host identifiers can be used as regular interface identifiers in protocols
    that don't require an identifier that is separate from locators, or they can be
    expanded to 128-bit IPv6 address like values for use with protocols that do need
    such an identifier-only value.</p>"
