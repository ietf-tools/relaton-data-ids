abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft we consider dynamic multipath routing and introduce two
    methods that use additive increase and multiplicative decrease for flow control,
    similar to TCP. Our first method allows for congestion control and re-routing
    flows as users join in or leave the network. As the number of applications and
    services supported by the Internet grows, bandwidth requirements increase dramatically
    so it is imperative to design methods to ensure not only that network throughput
    is maximized but also to ensure a level of fairness in network resource allocation.
    Our second method provides fairness over multiple streams of traffic. We drive
    the multiplicative decrease part of the algorithm with link queue occupancy data
    provided by an enhanced routing protocol.</p>"
