abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is designed to enable carrier grade
    packet transport and complement converged packet network deployments. Among the
    most important features of MPLS-TP are comprehensive OAM functions which enable
    network operators or service providers to provide various kinds of service characteristics
    such as prompt fault location, substantial survivability, performance monitoring
    and preliminary or in-service measurements. For the realization of those features
    by the MPLS Transport Profile, the definition of the maintenance points at which
    OAM messages are initiated, terminated and processed is very important. Based
    on the MPLS-TP OAM requirements this document elaborates on and gives guidance
    about maintenance points in MPLS-TP networks. This document is a product of a
    joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network.</p>"
