abstract:
- content: <p>This draft presents extensions to Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    to enable RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for improving the Quality of Experience
    (QoE) for delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The overall architecture
    is termed "Adaptive RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for Things (A-REaLiST)".
    It is particularly designed for applications which rely on real-time augmented
    vision through live First Person View (FPV) feed from constrained remote agents
    like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), etc. These extensions provide the necessary
    hooks to help solution designers ensure low-latency transfer of streams and, for
    contents like video, a quick recovery from freeze and corruption without incurring
    undue lag. A-REaLiST is an attempt to provide an integrated approach to maintain
    the balance amongst QoE, resource- efficiency and loss resilience. It provides
    the necessary hooks to optimize system performance by leveraging contextual intelligence
    inferred from instantaneous information segments in flight. These extensions equip
    CoAP with a standard for efficient RESTful streaming for Internet of Things (IoT)
    contrary to HTTP-streaming in conventional Internet.</p>
