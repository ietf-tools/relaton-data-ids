abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a binding revocation mechanism to terminate a
    mobile node's mobility session and the associated resources. This mechanism can
    be used both with base Mobile IPv6 and its extensions, such as Proxy Mobile IPv6.
    The mechanism allows the mobility entity which initiates the revocation procedure
    to request its peer to terminate either one, multiple or all specified Binding
    Cache entries. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
