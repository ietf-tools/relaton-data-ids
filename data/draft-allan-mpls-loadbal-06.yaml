abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3031 permits MPLS load balancing while making no specific representations
    as to implementation requirements. This has subsequently become an issue with
    respect to the reliability of path test mechanisms. Load balancing algorithms
    may separate path test probes from the path of interest. This document proposes
    guidelines for implementation of load balancing such that path test mechanisms
    are not impacted.</p>"
