abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema for
    reverse DNS management in a tightly controlled Representational State Transfer
    (REST) environment. This document describes a schema that has been developed and
    deployed by ICANN in a "RESTful" system since 2011 and is being used by the registries
    responsible for reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
    through an HTTPS transaction that is mediated by an X.509 certificate.</p>
