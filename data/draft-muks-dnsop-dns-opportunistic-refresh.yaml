abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism whereby a DNS resolver can opportunistically
    refresh the TTLs of cached records of a zone using serial number information carried
    in responses from the zone's nameservers. As well as improving resolver response
    time by reducing the need to make upstream queries, the mechanism can also reduce
    the workload of authoritative servers.</p>"
