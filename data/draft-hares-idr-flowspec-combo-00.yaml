abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution of filters
    and actions that apply when packets are received on a router with the flow specification
    function turned on. If one considers the reception of the packet as an event,
    then BGP flow specification describes a set of minimalistic Event-Match Condition-Action
    policies. The initial set of policy (RFC5575 and RFC7674) for this policy includes
    12 types of match filters encoded in the NLRI for two types of SAFIs (IP-only
    SAFI, 133; VPN SAFI, 134) for IPv4. The popularity of these flow specification
    filters in deployment for DoS and SDN/NFV has led to the requirement for more
    BGP flow specification match filters in the NLRI and more BGP flow specification
    actions. This document provides rules for combining new flow specification packet
    ECA policies which support IPv6, L2, nvo03 and MPLS match filters, and new actions.
    This document also provides rules for the interaction of IDR Flow Specification
    policy (session ephemeral policy) with policy found in I2RS (reboot ephemeral
    policy), and policy found in ACLs and Policy routing (configuration policy).</p>"
