abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Connection Service (SXS) is a JSON/REST Web Service that may
    be used to establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device to an account
    held with a Web Service Provider. Multiple connection bindings may be established
    under the same account to support multiple devices and/or multiple users of a
    single device. A connection binding permits a device to securely connect to one
    or more services offered by the Web Service Provider with support for protocol
    and protocol version agilty and fault tollerance. The protocol is presented as
    a HTTP/JSON Web Service and uses the HTTP session continuation mechanism for authentication
    of transaction messages and supports negotiation of a HTTP session continuation
    mechanism context for the established endpoint connections.</p>"
