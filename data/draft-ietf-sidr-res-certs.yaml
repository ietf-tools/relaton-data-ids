abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
    the purpose of supporting validation of assertions of "right-of-use" of Internet
    Number Resources (INRs). The certificates issued under this profile are used to
    convey the issuer's authorization of the subject to be regarded as the current
    holder of a "right-of-use" of the INRs that are described in the certificate.
    This document contains the normative specification of Certificate and Certificate
    Revocation List (CRL) syntax in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
    This document also specifies profiles for the format of certificate requests and
    specifies the Relying Party RPKI certificate path validation procedure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
