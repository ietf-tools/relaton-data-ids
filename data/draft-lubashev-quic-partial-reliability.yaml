abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces a new EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame to enable partial
    reliability for QUIC streams. The EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame allows a sender to
    give up on retransmitting older parts of a stream and to notify the receiver about
    this decision. The content of this draft is intended for merging into QUIC transport,
    recovery, and applicability drafts as a negotiable extension and/or QUIC Version
    2 transport feature.</p>"
