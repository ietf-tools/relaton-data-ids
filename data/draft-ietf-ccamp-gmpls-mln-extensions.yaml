abstract:
- content: "<p>There are specific requirements for the support of networks comprising
    Label Switching Routers (LSRs) participating in different data plane switching
    layers controlled by a single Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
    control plane instance, referred to as GMPLS Multi-Layer Networks / Multi-Region
    Networks (MLN/MRN). This document defines extensions to GMPLS routing and signaling
    protocols so as to support the operation of GMPLS Multi-Layer / Multi-Region Networks.
    It covers the elements of a single GMPLS control plane instance controlling multiple
    Label Switched Path (LSP) regions or layers within a single Traffic Engineering
    (TE) domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
