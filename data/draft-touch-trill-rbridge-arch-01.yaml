abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols as
    a control plane. They combine the link layer ability to allow hosts to reattach
    without renumbering with network layer routing benefits. RBridges use existing
    link state routing to provide higher RBridge to RBridge cross-section bandwidth,
    fast convergence on reconfiguration, and more robust under link interruption than
    an equivalent set of conventional bridges using existing spanning tree forwarding.
    They are intended to apply to similar L2 network sizes as conventional bridges
    and are intended to be backward compatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress
    and transit. They also attempt to retain as much 'plug and play' as is already
    available in existing bridges. This document proposes an RBridge system as a solution
    to the TRILL problem. It also defines the RBridge architecture, defines its terminology,
    and describes basic components and desired behavior. One or more separate documents
    specify the protocols and mechanisms that satisfy the architecture presented herein.</p>"
