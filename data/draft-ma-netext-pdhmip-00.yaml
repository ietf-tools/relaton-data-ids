abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains how network mobility and DHCPv6-based Prefix
    Delegation works with hierarchy mobile IPv6. It is an extension of HMIPv6 and
    allows a mobile network to attach to a MAP via a mobile router. It also makes
    use of the mechanism of DHCPv6PD to assign mobile network prefix (es) to the mobile
    router which plays the role of requesting router.</p>"
