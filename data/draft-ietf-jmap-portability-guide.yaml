abstract:
- content: "<p>JMAP (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly and scalable
    protocol that can be used for data of any type. This makes it a good fit for migrations
    or data portability use cases that are focusing on data import and export. However,
    due to its large set of features, it is also quite complex, which makes it difficult
    to explore new application domains in practice. The goal of this document is to
    provide guidelines on implementing essential parts of JMAP for a much lower entry
    barrier and more efficient implementation of the protocol.</p>"
