abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement for the proposed Path Computation
    Element (PCE). The PCE is an approach to MPLS traffic engineering path computation
    that is particularly applicable in inter-domain environments. In this context,
    a domain may be an IGP area, an Autonomous System, or some other division of computational
    responsibility. An overview of solution alternatives and proposed PCE work group
    charter is also provided.</p>"
