abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines the nature of the Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) as an unincorporated association, reviews some history of the IETF Secretariat
    relevant to the current structure of the organization, and proposes steps that
    might be taken to move forward in the interest of the Internet community more
    generally. Since the IETF serves as a focal point in the technical evolution of
    the Internet infrastructure, it is important that any organizational changes take
    into account the wider public interest. Considerations of who provides support
    to the IETF hinge on the legal status of the IETF itself. Steps should be taken
    to clarify this matter as a first priority.</p>"
