abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is able of determining paths according
    to constraints expressed in the form of metrics. The value of the metric can be
    signaled as a bound or maximum, meaning that path metric must be less than or
    equal such value. While this can be sufficient for certain services, some others
    can require the utilization of Precision Availability Metrics (PAM). This document
    defines extensions to the METRIC object networking services with performance requirements
    expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLO) using PAM.</p>"
