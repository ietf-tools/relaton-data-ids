abstract:
- content: <p>Some operators deploy networks consisting of multiple BGP Autonomous-
    Systems (ASNs) under the same administrative control. There are also implementations
    which use only one routing protocol, namely BGP, as in [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc],
    for example. In such designs, inter-AS traffic engineering is commonly implemented
    using BGP policies, by configuring multiple routers at the ASN boundaries. This
    distributed policy model is difficult to manage and scale due to its dependency
    on complex routing policies and the need to develop and maintain a model for per-prefix
    path preference signaling. One example of such models could be standard BGP community-based
    (see [RFC1997]) signaling, which requires careful documentation and consistent
    configuration. Furthermore, automating such policy configuration changes for the
    purpose of centralized management requires additional efforts and is dependent
    on a particular vendor's configuration management (CLI extensions, NetConf [RFC6241]
    etc). This document proposes a method for inter-AS traffic engineering for use
    with the kind of deployment scenarios outlined above. No protocol changes or additional
    features are required to implement this method. The key to the proposed methodology
    is a new software entity called "BGP Controller" - a special purpose application
    that peers with all eBGP speakers in the managed network. This controller constructs
    live state of the underlying BGP ASN graph and presents multi-topology view of
    this graph via a simple API to third-party applications interested in performing
    network traffic engineering. An example application could be an operational tool
    used to drain traffic from network devices. In response to changes in the logical
    network topology proposed by these applications, the controller computes new routing
    tables, and pushes them down to the network devices via the established BGP sessions.</p>
