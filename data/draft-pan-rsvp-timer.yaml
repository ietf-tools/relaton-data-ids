abstract:
- content: "<p>The current resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) design has no reliability
    mechanism for the delivery of control messages. Instead, RSVP relies on periodic
    refresh between routers to maintain reservation states. This approach has several
    problems in a congested network. End systems send Path and Resv messages to set
    up RSVP connections. If the first Path or Resv message from an end system is accidentally
    lost in the network, a copy of the message will not be retransmitted until the
    end of a refresh interval, causing a delay of 30 seconds or more until a reservation
    is established. If a congested link causes a tear-down message (PathTear or ResvTear)
    to be dropped, the corresponding reservation will not be removed from the routers
    until the RSVP cleanup timer expires.</p>"
