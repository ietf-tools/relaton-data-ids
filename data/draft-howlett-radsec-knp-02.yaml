abstract:
- content: "<p>The Key Negotiation Protocol enables an untrusting RADIUS client and
    RADIUS server to derive a key by reference to a mutually trusted actor called
    the Introducer. This key may subsequently be used for one of two purposes. First,
    it can credential a TLS PSK ciphersuite applied to a RadSec connection between
    the RADIUS client and RADIUS server; or secondly, to establish a trust relationship
    between the RADIUS client and a second Introducer that is trusted by the first
    Introducer. The composition of these capabilities enables a RADIUS client to establish
    a RadSec connection with any RADIUS server with whom it shares a direct or indirect
    trust relationship via one or more Introducers.</p>"
