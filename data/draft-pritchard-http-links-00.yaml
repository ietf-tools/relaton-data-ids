abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Hyperlink maintenance allows robots and servers to cooperate in
    propagating the effects of daily changes in the millions of resource locations
    in the wwweb. Here, we propose developing the definitions of the LINK and UNLINK
    methods defined for HTTP since RFC 1945 and which remain largely unimplemented
    and unused. We believe that the only reason these methods have not been employed
    is that they remain too loosely defined and implicitly too inefficient. A new
    syntax and semantics simplify implementation and improve utility.</p>"
