abstract:
- content: "<p>The [DTLS] draft identifies the need for an information exchange mechanism
    between a PE device and its adjunct L2PE devices in the decoupled transparent
    LAN architecture. For example, the PE needs to provide information to an L2PE
    about the existence of remote site(s), and the MPLS label(s) that the L2PE needs
    to use to reach those site(s). The [HVPLS] draft requires signaling between the
    PE- rs and the MTU-s device to setup the spoke VC connection for the VPLS service.</p>"
