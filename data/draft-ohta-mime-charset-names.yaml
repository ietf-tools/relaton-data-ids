abstract:
- content: "<p>Though the ISO character set standard of ISO 10646 is specified reasonably
    well about European characters, it is not so useful in an fully internationalized
    environment. For the practical use of ISO 10646, a lot of external profiling such
    as restriction of characters, restriction of combination of characters and addition
    of language information is necessary. This memo provides information on such profiling,
    along with MIME charset names to each profiled instance. Though all the effort
    is done to make the resulting charset as useful 10646 based charset as possible,
    the result is not so good. So, the charsets defined in this memo are only for
    reference purpose and its use for practical purpose is strongly discouraged.</p>"
