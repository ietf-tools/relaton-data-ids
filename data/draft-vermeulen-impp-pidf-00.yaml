abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the format of presence information. It makes
    deliberately abstraction from issues associated with the transport of this information.
    The proposed format follows the W3C XML recommendation, such that presence information
    are valid XML documents according to a presence DTD. As several types of devices
    are envisioned to handle presence information, including devices with low computing
    power and networking capabilities, the defined format has been kept as simple
    as possible, with only five tags defined, two of which with no defined attributes.</p>"
