abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a technique for MPLS to support Differentiated
    Services (Diff-Serv) over PPP links in non-ECN-capable [ECN] networks. Briefly,
    we propose that: - Packets belonging to the same PHB forwarding class (PFC), as
    defined in [DIFF_MPLS_EXT], be transported over the same PPP LSP. - For a given
    FEC, a separate PPP LSP should be established for each PFC, so that multiple PPP
    LSPs are established in parallel for support of Diff-Serv.</p>"
