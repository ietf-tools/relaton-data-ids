abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has existing mechanisms for securing
    its signaling messages. SIP has several transport layers it works across: TCP,
    UDP, SCTP, and TLS over TCP. There currently is no mechanism to ensure that if
    TLS over TCP is chosen by the originating UAC, the messaging will remain encrypted
    on a hop-by-hop basis to the destination UAS. This document discusses this scenario,
    providing the requirements for such to exist, and offering pieces of a possible
    solution for this set of requirements.</p>"
