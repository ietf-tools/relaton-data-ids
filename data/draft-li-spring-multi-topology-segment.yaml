abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Topologies (MTs) can be used for computing different paths for
    unicast traffic, multicast traffic, different classes of service based on flexible
    criteria, or an in-band network management topology. This document proposes the
    multi-topology segment for segment routing. MRT FRR using multi-topology segment
    is described as the use case to explains the procedures of the forwarding plane
    and the control plane for multi-topology segment..</p>"
