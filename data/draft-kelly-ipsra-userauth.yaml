abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec, when used with IKE [RFC2409], provides for authentication of
    endpoints from the device level to the user level. However, there has been movement
    within the IPsec development community to provide additional support for legacy
    user-level authentication mechanisms such as those supported by RADIUS [RFC2138].
    At least 2 approaches to this problem have been proposed thus far, both using
    the same basic underlying framework, but that underlying framework relies upon
    extending IKE in ways that may not be prudent. This document proposes an alternative
    approach which provides much of the same functionality without requiring any modification
    to the existing IPsec framework.</p>"
