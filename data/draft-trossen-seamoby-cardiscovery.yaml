abstract:
- content: "<p>A critical requirement in the protocols being designed for seamless
    IP-level handovers, such as fast handover and context transfer, is that the target
    access router (TAR) for the mobile node's (MN) handover is known to the current
    access router (AR). The TAR needs to have the capability set necessary to meet
    the MN's requirements, and meet any local policy requirements. While the TAR selection
    process happens at the time of handover, the ARs which have the capabilities to
    meet the MN's requirements can be identified in advance. These ARs are called
    candidate access routers (CARs).</p>"
