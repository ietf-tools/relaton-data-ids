abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved
    parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP. These parity codes are systematic
    codes, where a number of FEC repair packets are generated from a set of source
    packets. These repair packets are sent in a redundancy RTP stream separate from
    the source RTP stream that carries the source packets. RTP source packets that
    were lost in transmission can be reconstructed using the source and repair packets
    that were received. The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes which are
    defined in this specification offer a good protection against random and bursty
    packet losses, respectively, at a cost of decent complexity. The RTP payload formats
    that are defined in this document address the scalability issues experienced with
    the earlier specifications including RFC 2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and
    offer several improvements. Due to these changes, the new payload formats are
    not backward compatible with the earlier specifications, but endpoints that do
    not implement this specification can still work by simply ignoring the FEC repair
    packets.</p>"
