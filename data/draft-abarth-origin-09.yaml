abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the concept of an "origin", which represents a
    web principal. Typically, user agents isolate content retrieved from different
    origins to prevent a malicious web site operator from interfering with the operation
    of benign web sites. In particular, this document defines how to compute an origin
    from a URI, how to serialize an origin to a string, and an HTTP header, named
    "Origin", for indicating which origin caused the user agent to issue a particular
    HTTP request.</p>
