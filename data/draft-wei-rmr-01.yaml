abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment and provisioning of multicast services must satisfy
    certain network design constraints in the last mile. It is common for a network
    design to have a small set of intelligent layer 3 devices (controllers) and a
    larger set of simpler layer 2 devices (aggregators). The controllers handle routing,
    user authentication and access control etc. They are connected via a network to
    the aggregators closer to the clients. Special design is needed to support multicast
    over this network. This draft proposes a Remote Multicast Replication (RMR) protocol,
    that reduces or removes duplicate multicast traffic in between the controllers
    and the aggregators. The RMR protocol is independent of layer 2 technology and
    topology being used.</p>"
