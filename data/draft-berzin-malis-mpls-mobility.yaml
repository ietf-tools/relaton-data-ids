abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new approach to handling user mobility at
    the network layer in the context of Multi-Protocol Label Switched Networks (MPLS).
    This approach does not rely on the existing IP mobility management protocols such
    as Mobile IP, and is instead based on the combination of Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP)
    and MPLS. This document proposes to introduce new protocol elements to MP-BGP
    to achieve Mobility Label distribution at the network control plane and the optimal
    packet delivery to the mobile node by the network forwarding plane using MPLS.</p>"
