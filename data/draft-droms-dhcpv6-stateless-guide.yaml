abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateless DHCPv6 service is used by hosts to obtain configuration information
    such as the addresses of DNS servers that does not require the maintenance of
    any dynamic state for individual clients. A host that uses stateless DHCP must
    have obtained its IPv6 addresses through some other mechanism, typically stateless
    address autoconfiguration. This document is a guide to the protocol messages and
    options that must be implemented to provide stateless DHCPv6 service.</p>"
