abstract:
- content: "<p>User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0. UMA defines how
    resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients operated by arbitrary
    requesting parties, where the resources reside on any number of resource servers,
    and where a centralized authorization server governs access based on resource
    owner policy. This document provides a contractual framework that defines the
    minimum obligations of parties that operate and use UMA-conforming software programs
    and services. The goal of this framework is to support end-to-end legal enforceability
    of the terms and conditions of access sharing relationships between authorizing
    and requesting sides that use UMA. The audience for this document includes technologists,
    legal professionals, and operators of UMA-conforming services.</p>"
