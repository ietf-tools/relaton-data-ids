abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3) is secure,
    operators and administrators have found that deploying it can be problematic in
    large distributions, due to a lack of integration between its User-Based Security
    Model (USM) and other authentication and user management infrastructure. This
    memo contains an evaluation of three proposals for an integrated security model
    for SNMP, and, based on these proposals, suggests how the ISMS (Integrated Security
    Model for SNMP) working group might move forward.</p>"
