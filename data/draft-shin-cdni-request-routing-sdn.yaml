abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-defined networking (SDN) is emerging and intensively discussed
    as one of the most promising technologies to provide centralized, programmable
    control planes for network service providers (NSPs). In this sense, SDN could
    be also considered as one of candidates to facilitate CDNI Request Routing. This
    document discusses how SDN can be used for downstream CDN selection within CDNI
    request routing.</p>"
