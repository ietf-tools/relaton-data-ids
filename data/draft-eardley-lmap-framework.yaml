abstract:
- content: "<p>Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation
    of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols that coordinate
    interactions between the components. The document presents an overall framework
    for large-scale measurements and discusses which elements could be standardised
    in the IETF. It is intended to assist the discussions about the potential creation
    of the LMAP working group.</p>"
