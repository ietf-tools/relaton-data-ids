abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the OSPF protocol to support
    Traffic Engineering [1]. The OSPF protocol is specified in [2], This extension
    make use of opaque LSA defined in [3] and provides similar information to what
    is defined in the ISIS extensions for traffic engineering[4]. This document extends
    the OSPF protocol by specifying new information that a router can place in a type
    10 opaque Link State Advertisement (LSA). This information describes additional
    information about the state of the network that is useful for traffic engineering.</p>"
