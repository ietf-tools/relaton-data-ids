abstract:
- content: "<p>WebRTC, Web Real-Time Communications, is a set of protocols and APIs
    used to enable web developers to add real-time communications into their web pages
    and applications with a few lines of JavaScript. WebRTC media flows are encrypted
    and authenticated by SRTP, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol while the key
    agreement is provided by DTLS-SRTP, Datagram Transport Layer Security for Secure
    Real-time Transport Protocol. However, without some third party identity service
    or certificate authority, WebRTC media flows have no protection against a man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) attack. ZRTP, Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP, RFC 6189,
    does provide protection against MitM attackers using key continuity augmented
    with a Short Authentication String (SAS). This specification describes how ZRTP
    can be used over the WebRTC data channel to provide MitM protection for WebRTC
    media flows keyed using DTLS-SRTP. This provides users protection against MitM
    attackers without requiring browsers to support ZRTP or users to download a plugin
    or extension to implement ZRTP.</p>"
