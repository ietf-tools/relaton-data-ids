abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbour Discovery Proxy is used to provide an address presence on
    a link from nodes which are no themselves present. It allows a node to receive
    packets directed at its address by allowing another device to neighbour advertise
    on its behalf. Neighbour Discovery Proxy is used in Mobile IPv6 and related protocols
    to provide reachability from nodes on the home network when a Mobile Node is not
    at home, by allowing the Home Agent to act as proxy. It is also used as a mechanism
    to allow a global prefix to span multiple links, where proxies act as relays for
    neighbour discovery messages. Neighbour Discovery Proxy currently cannot be secured
    using SEND. Today, SEND assumes that a node advertising an address is the address
    owner and in possession of appropriate public and private keys for that node.
    This document describes how existing practice for proxy Neighbour Discovery relates
    to Secured Neighbour Discovery.</p>"
