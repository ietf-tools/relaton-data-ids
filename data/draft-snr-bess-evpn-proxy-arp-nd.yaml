abstract:
- content: "<p>The MAC/IP Advertisement route specified in [RFC7432] can optionally
    carry IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use
    this information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6
    Neighbor Solicitation messages (or 'unicast- forward' them to the owner of the
    MAC) and reduce/suppress the flooding produced by the Address Resolution procedure.
    This EVPN capability is extremely useful in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and
    Data Centers (DCs) with large broadcast domains, where the amount of ARP/ND flooded
    traffic causes issues on routers and CEs, as explained in [RFC6820]. This document
    describes how the [RFC7432] EVPN proxy- ARP/ND function may be implemented to
    help IXPs and other operators deal with the issues derived from Address Resolution
    in large broadcast domains.</p>"
