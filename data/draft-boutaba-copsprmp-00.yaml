abstract:
- content: "<p>In COPS-PR, the (clients of the) PEPs use special structures, called
    Policy Information Bases (PIBs) that store the policies that are sent by the PDPs.
    PIBs are well-defined structures that are not meant to be modified to adapt to
    the needs of each network. This makes COPS-PR PEPs rigid and inflexible. This
    document describes an extension of the COPS-PR protocol that allows the PEPs to
    store meta-policies that control the content of their PIBs. The set of meta-policies
    that the PEPs can store is not predefined and customized policies can be supported.
    The use of meta-policies pushes intelligence towards the PEPs and makes them more
    self- dependent. In this way, the model becomes more distributed, scalable and
    fault-tolerant, while the bandwidth consumption and the (real- time) processing
    load of the PDP are reduced.</p>"
