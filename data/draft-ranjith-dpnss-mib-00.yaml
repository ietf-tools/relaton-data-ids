abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes a set of managed objects for SNMP-based management of DPNSS 1 interfaces.
    DPNSS 1 is a common-channel signaling system and is primarily intended for use
    between PBXs in private networks via time-slot 16 of 2.048 Mbit/s digital transmission
    system. Similarly it may be used in time-slot 24 of a 1.544 Mbit/s digital transmission
    system. The DPNSS 1 protocol is completely specified in British Telecom Network
    Requirement 188 (BTNR 188) series of specifications [10].</p>"
