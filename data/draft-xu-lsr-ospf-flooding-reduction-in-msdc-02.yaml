abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for MSDC (Massively
    Scalable Data Center) networks. For a given OSPF router within the CLOS topology,
    it would receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSA from multiple OSPF neighbors.
    In addition, two OSPF neighbors may send each other the same LSA simultaneously.
    The unnecessary link-state information flooding wastes the precious process resource
    of OSPF routers greatly due to the fact that there are too many OSPF neighbors
    for each OSPF router within the CLOS topology. This document proposes some extensions
    to OSPF so as to reduce the OSPF flooding within MSDC networks greatly. The reduction
    of the OSPF flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.
    These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</p>"
