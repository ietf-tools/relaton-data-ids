abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL
    based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities or (c) Campus
    TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more ISPs that provide regular
    IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. Some of the solutions proposed as in [DRAFT-EVPN]
    have not dealt with the scalable methods in their details as to how these services
    could be provided such that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected with issues
    like nick-name collisions for unicast and multicast being taken care of. It has
    been found that with extensions to BGP and a scalable method on Provider edge
    devices the problem statement which we will define below can be handled. Specifically
    the division of the nick-name into site-id and Rbridge-ID is one that can limit
    the number of sites that can be interconnected and the number of Rbridges within
    each such site that can be provisioned. The draft proposed herein deals / overcomes
    these issues by not limiting the number of sites and Rbridges within a TRILL site
    interconnect. Only the maximum space for a nick-name which happens to be 16 bits
    is the actual limit. MAC moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites can also
    be realized. This document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC- VPN vrfs at
    the ISP cloud PE devices. We deal in depth with the control plane and data plane
    particulars for unicast and multicast in this scheme. Additionally Provider Backbone
    like functionality is also covered.</p>"
