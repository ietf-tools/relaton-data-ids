abstract:
- content: "<p>This document adapts the [RFC6349] Framework for TCP Throughput Testing
    to the [RFC9000] QUIC protocol. The adapted framework describes a practical methodology
    for measuring end-to-end QUIC Throughput in a managed IP network. The goal of
    the methodology is to provide a better indication in regard to user experience.
    In this framework, QUIC, UDP, and IP parameters are specified to optimize QUIC
    Throughput.</p>"
