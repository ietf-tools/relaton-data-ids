abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a range of implementation and specification
    issues concerning features related to the use of location-related attributes in
    NFSv4. These include migration, which transfers responsibility for a file system
    from one server to another, and trunking which deals with the discovery and control
    of the set of server endpoints to use to access a file system. The focus of the
    discussion, which relates to multiple minor versions, is on defining the appropriate
    clarifications and corrections for existing specifications.</p>"
