abstract:
- content: "<p>Fast handover protocols for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 define mobility management
    procedures that support unicast communication at reduced handover latency. Fast
    handover base operations do not affect multicast communication, and hence do not
    accelerate handover management for native multicast listeners. Many multicast
    applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, are comprised of delay-sensitive
    real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover execution. This document
    specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers
    for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management
    in fast handover operations. This multicast support is provided first at the control
    plane by a management of rapid context transfer between access routers, second
    at the data plane by an optional fast traffic forwarding that MAY include buffering.</p>"
