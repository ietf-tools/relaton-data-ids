abstract:
- content: <p>Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that explicitly
    indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. SR can be instantiated
    on the MPLS data plane (MPLS-SR) and the IPv6 data plane (SRv6). On the MPLS-SR
    data plane, a segment is encoded as an MPLS label, and an ordered list of segments
    is encoded as a stack of labels. On the SRv6 data plane, a segment is encoded
    as an IPv6 address (SRv6 SID) [RFC8986], and an ordered list of segments is encoded
    as an ordered list of SRv6 SIDs in the SR header (SRH) [RFC8754]. The ingress
    node steers packets into a specific path according to the ordered list of segments
    (SR Policy) as defined in [RFC9256]. Service Function Chaining (SFC) defines an
    ordered set of service functions and subsequent "steering" of traffic through
    them. The architecture of SFC is defined in [RFC7665]. This document describes
    the common failure scenarios and protection mechanisms of service function chains
    in SR networks. Then implementation recommendations for protection of service
    function chains are proposed.</p>
