    which ensures that a cryptographically secured communication channel is always
    established with Transport Layer Security (TLS) when delivering messages via Simple
    Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) between Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) of pre-registered
    participants. Mainly the participants exchange SMTP routing information about
    their MTA infrastructure for this purpose.</p>"
