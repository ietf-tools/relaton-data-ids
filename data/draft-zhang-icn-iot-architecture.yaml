abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to
    Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains, the
    current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented IoT platform so that objects
    can be made accessible to applications across organizations and domains. Towards
    this goal, quite a few proposals have been made to build a unified IoT platform
    as an overlay on top of today's Internet. Such overlay solutions, however, are
    inadequate to address the important challenges posed by a unified IoT system,
    especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and communication reliability, due
    to the inherent inefficiencies of the current Internet. To address this problem,
    we propose to build a unified IoT platform based on the Information Centric Network
    (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT [20]. ICN-IoT leverages the salient
    features of ICN, and thus provides seamless device-to-device (D2D) communication,
    mobility support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery leveraging
    in-network computing, caching and storage. This draft begins by motivating the
    need for an unified ICN-IoT platform to connect heterogenous IoT systems. We then
    propose an ICN-IoT system architecture and middleware components which includes
    device/network-service discovery, naming service, IoT service discovery, contextual
    processing, pub/sub management to support efficient naming, data discovery, data
    processing and data distribution.</p>"
