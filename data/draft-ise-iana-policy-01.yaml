abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries
    to track codepoints used by protocols such as those defined by the IETF and documented
    in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream. The Independent Submissions Stream is another
    source of documents that can be published as RFCs. This stream is under the care
    of the Independent Submissions Editor (ISE). This document complements RFC 4846
    by providing a description of how the ISE currently handles documents in the Independent
    Submissions Stream that request actions from the IANA. Nothing in this document
    changes existing IANA registries or their allocation policies, nor does it change
    any previously documented processes.</p>"
