abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft gives provides an example set of licensing terms for use
    in IPR disclosures that are compatible with the goals of the proposed video-codec
    working group for further discussion and refinement by participants at the IETF.
    Although usage of such a license is strictly voluntary, the hope is that getting
    agreement on a set of terms before the bulk of the work begins will allow contributors
    to use a common license and minimize the amount of legal analysis that must be
    performed in order to deploy the codec.</p>"
