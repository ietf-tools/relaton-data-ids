abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an IMAP protocol extension allowing clients
    to submit new messages using IMAP. This is the so-called 'IMAP Push' approach
    currently being considered by the lemonade working group as one solution to the
    'forward without download' problem (that is, as a means for clients to send new
    messages consisting of or containing all or parts of previously received messages
    without having to download and upload the data). This proposal relies on additional
    IMAP extensions, including CATENATE and Annotations. The IMAP extension described
    here requires that the message to be submitted be already composed and ready to
    go at the time of submission.</p>"
