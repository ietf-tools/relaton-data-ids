abstract:
- content: "<p>Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store information
    about users and other network entities. One of the many possible uses of a directory
    service is to store information about users' email accounts, such as their email
    addresses, and how messages addressed to them should be routed. In the interest
    of interoperability, it is desirable to have a common schema for such email-related
    information. This document defines an object class called 'mailRecipient' to support
    SMTP [3] message transfer agents (MTAs) in routing RFC 822- based email messages
    [4] within an organization. The intent is to suggest a model for MTA interoperability
    via the directory, to provide information about a solution that has been implemented
    and deployed, and to stimulate discussion about whether and how to standardize
    the functionality in question.</p>"
