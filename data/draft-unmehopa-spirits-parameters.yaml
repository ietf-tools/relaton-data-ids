abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Parlay parameters (appropriately encoded Parlay
    Events, generated by the PSTN) which the SPIRITS protocol can transport from the
    PSTN into the IP network, and vice versa. These parameters are PARLAY equivalents
    of INAP parameters described in [1]. The SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through
    which PSTN can request actions (services) to be carried out in the IP network
    in response to events (IN Triggers) occurring within the PSTN/IN. These services
    include, but are not limited to: Incoming Call Notification (Internet Call Waiting),
    Internet Caller-Id Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding ('Follow Me').</p>"
