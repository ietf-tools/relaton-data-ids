abstract:
- content: <p>Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and
    Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities required for are MPLS- TP OAM.
    Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path for any
    loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors the integrity of
    the routing of the path between sink and source for any connectivity issues. RDI
    enables an End Point to report, to its associated End Point, a fault or defect
    condition that it detects on a PW, LSP or Section. This document specifies methods
    for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections
    using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). Requirements Language The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC2119 [1].</p>
