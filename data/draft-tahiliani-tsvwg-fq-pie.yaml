abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents Flow Queue Proportional Integral controller
    Enhanced (FQ-PIE), a hybrid packet scheduler and Active Queue Management (AQM)
    algorithm to isolate flows and tackle the problem of bufferbloat. FQ-PIE uses
    hashing to classify incoming packets into different queues and provide flow isolation.
    Packets are dequeued by using a variant of the round robin scheduler. Each such
    flow is managed by the PIE algorithm to maintain high link utilization while controlling
    the queue delay to a target value.</p>"
