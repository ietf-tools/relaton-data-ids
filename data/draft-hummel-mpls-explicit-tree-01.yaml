abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes the TREE ROUTE TLV that encodes a tree structured
    route which can be used to carry explicit routing information. It also specifies
    the progression of the TLV from the root of the tree to the leaf nodes. Every
    node that the TLV traversed has to decode/process the TLV in such a way that the
    correct child link/ nodes are determined as well as the respective subtree route
    information. Individual Information targetted for any specific node can also be
    packed into this TREE ROUTE TLV. The draft also presents the benefits of using
    TREE ROUTE TLV in MPLS. The applications include constrain based routing, traffic
    engineering, VPN installations and static multicast tree. The capability of carrying
    targetted information for individual node in the tree is very powerful in MPLS.
    This allows different nodes in the tree route to use the same tree route for different
    FECs. The application of this TLV is not mpls-specific. Other Working Groups may
    consider the proposed TLV as well.</p>"
