abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests an extension to the Post Office Protocol version
    3 (RFC 1725) that adds an extra command to selective compress the maildrop before
    transferring the mail to the recipient. Given the extensive and explosive growth
    of mobile uses of the Internet especially the numbers of people who access their
    e-mail via dialup modems, it does not make sense to have to transfer e-mail to
    the client in uncompressed form. This draft discusses a new command that will
    make the pop3 server to intelligently compress the maildrop into a single file
    and then for it to be sent to the client. The client will then process the compressed
    mail accordingly.</p>"
