abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of node identifier, in practical terms an IP address, is
    crucial in ad hoc networks. Its use allows the setup of IP routing for ad hoc
    connectivity and the identification of several wireless devices as part of a unique
    ad hoc node. In this document, a new addressable object is defined: the ad hoc
    connector. It virtualizes several ad hoc network interfaces into a single addressable
    object. To locally address ad hoc connectors, a third IPv6 local-use unicast address
    (adhoc-local address) and the correlated use of the subnet multicast scope are
    defined.</p>"
