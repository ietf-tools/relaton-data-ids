- content: "<p>This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-based management
    of DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems. This memo
    specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2[5][6][7].
    The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
    This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group.</p>"
