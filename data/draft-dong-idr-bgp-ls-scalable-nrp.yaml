abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced characteristics,
    such as guaranteed resources, latency, jitter, etc., so as to support customers
    requirements on connectivity services with these enhanced characteristics. Enhanced
    VPN requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset
    of the network resources and associated policies on each of a connected set of
    links in the underlay network. An NRP could be used as the underlay to support
    one or a group of enhanced VPN services. The NRP-specific resource information
    and status needs to be collected from network nodes and reported to the network
    controller for NRP-specific management and path computation. This document specifies
    the BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) mechanisms with necessary extensions to advertise
    the information of NRPs to network controller in a scalable way. The NRP information
    is advertised using a separate type of BGP-LS NLRI, which allows flexible update
    of NRP information without impacting the based link state information.</p>"
