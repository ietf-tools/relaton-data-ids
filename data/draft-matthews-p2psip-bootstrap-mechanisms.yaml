abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms that a peer can use to locate and
    establish a Peer Protocol connection to an admitting peer in order to join an
    overlay network. In the first mechanism, the joining peer uses multicast to locate
    a bootstrap peer; in the second, the node uses one or more bootstrap servers to
    locate a bootstrap peer; in both cases, the bootstrap peer then proxies the request
    by the joining peer on to the admitting peer. Each mechanism has its advantages
    and disadvantages, and a node can utilize both.</p>"
