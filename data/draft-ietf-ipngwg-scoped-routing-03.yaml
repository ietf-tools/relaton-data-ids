abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a mechanism for generating forwarding tables
    that include scoped IPv6 addresses. It defines a set of rules for routers to implement
    in order to forward packets addressed to scoped unicast or multicast addresses
    regardless of the routing protocol. These rules apply to all scoped addresses.</p>"
