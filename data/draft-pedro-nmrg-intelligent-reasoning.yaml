abstract:
- content: "<p>The adoption of AI in network management solutions is becoming a reality.
    It is mainly supported by the need to resolve complex problems arisen from the
    acceptance of SDN/NFV technologies as well as network slicing. This allows current
    computer and network system infrastructures to constantly grow in complexity,
    in parallel to the demands of users. However, exploiting the possibilities of
    AI is not an easy task. There has been a lot of effort to make Machine Learning
    (ML) solutions reliable and acceptable but, at the same time, other mechanisms
    have been forgotten. It is the particular case of reasoning. Although it can provide
    enormous benefits to management solutions by, for example, inferring new knowledge
    and applying different kind of rules (e.g. logical) to choose from several actions,
    it has received little attention. While ML solutions work with data, so their
    only requirement from the network infrastructure is data retrieval, reasoning
    solutions work in collaboration to the network they are managing. This makes the
    challenges arisen from intelligent reasoning to be a key for the evolution of
    network management towards the full adoption of AI.</p>"
