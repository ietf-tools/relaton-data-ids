abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an LDAP [RFC4511] schema for implementing the
    Kerberos 5 [RFC4120] KDC Information Model [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kdc-model]. It also
    defines additional elements which are not covered by the Information Model, but
    are already in common use.1. Background and Motivation Both Kerberos and LDAP
    are frequently used separately for distributed authentication. They can also be
    used in combination, but typically their user databases remained separate. This
    distinction in databases causes unnecessary duplication of data and administration
    overhead. As such it is desirable for both systems to share a single database.
    Since the LDAP data model is more general it is most appropriate to store the
    Kerberos data in LDAP. A number of Kerberos implementations already have support
    for using LDAP as their KDC backing store. However, each implementation uses its
    own schema, and the multiple schemas are mutually incompatible. For the sake of
    interoperability and administrative ease, it is important to define a single standard
    schema that can be used uniformly by all Kerberos KDC implementations and interoperates
    with existing LDAP specifications.2. General Issues</p>"
