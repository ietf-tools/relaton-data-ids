abstract:
- content: <p>SATP Core defines an unidirectional transfer of assets in three stages,
    namely the Transfer Initiation stage (Stage-1), the Lock- Assertion stage (Stage-2)
    and the Commitment Establishment stage (Stage-3). This document defines the Setup
    Phase, often called "Stage-0", prior to the execution of SATP Core. During Setup,
    the two Gateways that would participate in the asset transfer are bound together
    via a "transfer context". The transfer context conveys information regarding the
    assets to be exchanged. Gateway can perform any kind of negotiation based on that
    transfer context, before entering into SATP Core.</p>
