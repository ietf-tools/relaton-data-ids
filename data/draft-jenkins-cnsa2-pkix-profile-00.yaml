abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile of X.509 v3 Certificates and X.509
    v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for applications that use Commercial National
    Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite published by the United States Government. The
    profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components
    of US National Security Systems that employ such X.509 certificates. US National
    Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also
    appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information.
    The profile is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of
    these and any other system deployments.</p>"
