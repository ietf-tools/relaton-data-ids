abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where
    network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion
    to the end-points. An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the
    sender. ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can
    be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx
    or DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case where more than
    one marking is received in one RTT. This documents specifies requirement for different
    ECN feedback scheme in the TCP header to provide more than one feedback signal
    per RTT.</p>"
