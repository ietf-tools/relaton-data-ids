abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents an experiment to review and classify Proposed Standards
    as not reflecting documented practice within the world today. The results identify
    three classes of documents marked as Proposed Standards that should be considered
    for retirement in some way or another. We propose four options to move forward
    with further work in this area ranging from doing nothing to accepting the results
    entirely.</p>"
