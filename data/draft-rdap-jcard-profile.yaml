abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional Internet
    Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to provide access to their
    resource registration information. RDAP uses jCard to convey information about
    individuals and other entities: for example, for the technical contact for a domain
    name. In practice, server operators are only using a small subset of jCard's functionality,
    so in an effort to simplify the requirements on the client side, this document
    defines a jCard profile for use with RDAP.</p>"
