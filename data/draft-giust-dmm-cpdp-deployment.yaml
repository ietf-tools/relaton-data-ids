abstract:
- content: "<p>The DMM working group is currently looking at solutions for mobility
    management based on control and data plane separation. In this context, the network
    entities in charge for the mobility control function are separated from the data
    plane nodes, responsible mainly for, but not limited to, data packet forwarding.
    This vision allows for the design of different interaction methods between the
    mobility control function and the data plane nodes. One of such mechanisms being
    currently discussed devises an SDN-based abstraction layer between control and
    data planes, embodied by an SDN Network Controller. This latter interfaces to
    the mobility control function through a north-bound interface (NBI), and programs
    the underneath infrastructure through a south-bound interface (SBI), e.g., OpenFlow.
    This draft describes multiple deployment scenarios for NBI and SBI interworking,
    given that multiple network controllers could be deployed in order to meet performance
    requirements e.g., related to latency.</p>"
