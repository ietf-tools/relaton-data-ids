abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a number of resource control requirements that
    enterprise network administrators face. It also discusses how RSVP is being used,
    or considered, in order to address these requirements. This document is offered
    as input to the IETF 77 RSVP mini-BOF. The authors recommend that the IETF continues
    supporting RSVP as a Standards Track protocol and continue facilitating development
    of necessary RSVP extensions in the Standards Track.</p>"
