abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile
    for compression of RTCP packets. The profile, called ROHC-RTCP, provides efficient
    and robust compression of RTCP packets, including frequently used RTCP features.
    ROHC-RTCP is intended to be used in conjunction with ROHC profiles for the compression
    of RTP headers such as RFC 3905 and ROHCv2, making use of context replication
    (RFC 4164) where appropriate. In particular, ROHC-RTCP is intended to remove the
    need for standardization of special-purpose variants of RTCP for applications
    just because these also need to work over low-speed links.</p>"
