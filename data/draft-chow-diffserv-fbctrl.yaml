abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a Feedback Control extension to Differentiated
    Services. Differentiated Services have been designed for scalability through handling
    aggregates of traffic instead of individual flows as in the Integrated Services.
    However, it has been observed that the DS mechanism in some situations can hardly
    achieve the desired quality of service and may result in unfair conditions. To
    remedy these problems, this draft describes a general feedback control paradigm
    that enables a network provider to impose a control mechanism upon their DS domain.
    As an instance of the general framework, a feedback control mechanism is proposed.
    Our simulation analysis demonstrates that the overall feedback controlled DS can
    offer a better resource utilisation and a fair resource sharing. Such control
    mechanism can also help enforce the desired service assurances. This document
    is intended to stimulate discussion in this direction. Further work is required
    to carefully define a set of primitive requirements that enables interoperability.
