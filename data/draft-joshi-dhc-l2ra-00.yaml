abstract:
- content: "<p>In some networks, DHCP servers rely on Relay Agent Information option
    appended by Relay Agents for IP address and other parameter assignment policies.
    This works fine when End Hosts are directly connected to Relay Agents. In some
    network configurations, one or more Layer 2 devices may reside between DHCP clients
    and Relay agent. In these network scenarios, it is difficult to use the Relay
    Agent Information option for IP address and other parameter assignment policies
    effectively. So there is a need for the closest Layer 2 device to append Relay
    Agent Information option in DHCP messages. These devices are typically known as
    Layer 2 Relay Agents. This document aims to describe the network scenarios where
    Layer 2 Relay Agent is in use and also how it handles DHCP messages.</p>"
