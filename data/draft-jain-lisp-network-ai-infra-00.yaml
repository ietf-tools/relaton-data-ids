abstract:
- content: "<p>The LISP control plane provides the mechanisms to support both Scale-
    Up and Scale-Out backend networks within AI infrastructure. This document outlines
    how LISP can enable a unified control plane architecture that accommodates both
    scaling technologies, offering flexibility in deployment. This approach allows
    AI/ML applications—whether focused on training or inference—to operate efficiently
    on a converged infrastructure, supporting diverse deployment scenarios using the
    same underlying network fabric.</p>"
