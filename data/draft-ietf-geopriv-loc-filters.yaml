abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes filters that limit asynchronous location notifications
    to compelling events. These filters are designed as an extension to RFC 4661,
    an XML-based format for event notification filtering, and based on RFC 3856, the
    SIP presence event package. The resulting location information is conveyed in
    existing location formats wrapped in the Presence Information Data Format Location
    Object (PIDF-LO). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
