abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding
    paradigm which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol and doesn't
    require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast state. A BFR cannot send
    a BIER packet to a given nexthop router unless that nexthop router has indicated
    that it can support the BIER forwarding procedure. This document defines a mechanism
    to signal that capability using OSPF. This mechanism is useful when the unicast
    route distribution is also done via OSPF.</p>"
