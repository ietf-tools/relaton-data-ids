abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of AI technology and digital twin technology
    to automate the management of computer network resources distributed across different
    locations. Digital twin technology involves creating a virtual model of real-world
    physical objects or processes, which is utilized to analyze and optimize complex
    systems. In a digital twin network, AI-based network management by automating
    distributed processing involves utilizing deep learning algorithms to analyze
    network traffic, identify potential issues, and take proactive measures to prevent
    or mitigate those issues. Network administrators can efficiently manage and optimize
    their networks, thereby improving network performance and reliability. AI-based
    network management, utilizing digital twin network technology, also aids in optimizing
    network performance by identifying bottlenecks in the network and automatically
    adjusting network settings to enhance throughput and reduce latency. By implementing
    AI-based network management through automated distributed processing, organizations
    can improve network performance, and reduce the need for manual network management
    tasks.</p>"
