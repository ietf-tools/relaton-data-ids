abstract:
- content: "<p>SPAN-A (pronounced 'spanner') is a candidate for the pre-midcom SPAN
    protocol. The scope of SPAN (Simple Protocol for Augmenting NATs) is to enable
    protocols involving multiple associated sessions to operate across NATs. Such
    protocols typically use transport addresses to identify associated sessions. This
    works well for environments where end-to-end addressing is in force, but is broken
    by the introduction of NATs. SPAN is intended to operate with symmetric NATs by
    using a relay outside the NAT. It complements STUN [STUN] which operates with
    various kinds of cone NAT.</p>"
