abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines and describes the use of U-turn alternates to
    provide local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in the event of a single
    failure, whether link, node or shared risk link group (SRLG). When a topology
    change occurs, a router S pre-computes for each prefix an alternate next-hop that
    can be used if the primary next-hop fails. An acceptable alternate can be either
    a loop-free alternate or a U-turn alternate. A U-turn alternate uses a neighbor,
    whose primary next-hop to the prefix is router S itself and which has itself a
    loop-free node-protecting alternate, which thus does not go through router S to
    reach the destination prefix.</p>"
