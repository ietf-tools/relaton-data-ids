abstract:
- content: "<p>The document 'LDAPv3: Grouping of Related Operations' [GROUPING] specifies
    a set of LDAPv3 operations and an LDAPv3 control that can be used to identify
    and manage sets of LDAP operations that are members of related groups. Collectively,
    these 'grouping' constructs provide a general framework for defining specific
    LDAPv3 grouping types with their associated processing semantics.</p>"
