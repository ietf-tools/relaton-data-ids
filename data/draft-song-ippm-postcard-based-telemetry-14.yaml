abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes a postcard-based telemetry method using packet-marking,
    referred to as PBT-M. PBT-M does not carry the telemetry data in user packets
    but sends the telemetry data through a dedicated packet. PBT-M does not require
    an extra instruction header but claims a bit as a trigger in existing header fields.
    PBT-M raises some unique issues that need to be considered. This document describes
    the high level scheme and covers the common requirements and issues when applying
    PBT-M in different networks. PBT-M is complementary to the other on-path telemetry
    schemes such as IOAM.</p>"
