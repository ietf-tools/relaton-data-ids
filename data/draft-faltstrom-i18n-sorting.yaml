abstract:
- content: "<p>Lookup, searching and sorting is somewhat defined when using a limited
    set of characters, and especially only one or a few scripts. When operating in
    a more complex environment, the algorithms get more complex, and in many cases
    need information about locale. This document describes some of the problems which
    one encounter in an international environment.</p>"
