abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks
    Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream
    CDN (dCDN). This document extends the Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement
    Interface (FCI) defined in RFC8008, to allow advertising of named footprint objects,
    that can be referenced in a consistent manner from Metadata Interface (MI), also
    defined in RFC8006, as well as from the FCI itself as well as additional interfaces
    in the Open Caching architecture. This document also supplements the CDNI Metadata
    Footprint Types defined in RFC8006 and modifies the CDNI operation as described
    in RFC7336.</p>"
