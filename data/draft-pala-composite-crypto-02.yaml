abstract:
- content: "<p>PKIs are used to provide scalability and ease key management. One type
    of PKIs that is predominant for securing communications and data is based on the
    X.509 standard. Since the security of PKIs, ultimately, depends on the security
    of the cryptographic building blocks that are used for authentication and encryption,
    the standards community made algorithm agility a priority. Algorithm agility,
    in particular, enables upgrading to newly available algorithms when needed. The
    CompositeCrypto (i.e., CompositeKey and CompositeSignature structures) described
    in this document provides an additional tool that enables the use of multiple
    algorithms to authenticate data without the need to use multiple certificates
    and more complex data structures. This document provide the description of the
    definition and encoding rules for CompositeKey and CompositeSignature. A description
    of how to use these structures in main PKIX objects (e.g., X.509 certificates,
    CRLs, OCSP responses, etc.) is also provided.</p>"
