abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism that enables an RPL node to measure
    the quality of an existing route to/from another RPL node in a low power and lossy
    network, thereby allowing the node to decide if it wants to initiate the discovery
    of a more optimal route.</p>"
