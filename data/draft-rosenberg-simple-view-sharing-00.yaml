abstract:
- content: "<p>Presence federation refers to the exchange of presence information
    between systems. One of the primary challenges in presence federation is scale.
    With a large number of watchers in one domain obtaining presence for many presentities
    in another, the amount of notification traffic is large. This document describes
    an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework, called
    view sharing. View sharing can substantially reduce the amount of traffic, but
    requires a certain level of trust between domains. View sharing allows the amount
    of presence traffic between domains to achieve the theoretical lower bound on
    information exchange in any presence system.</p>"
