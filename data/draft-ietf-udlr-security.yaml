abstract:
- content: "<p>Many operators may deploy network infrastructures that use unidirectional
    links such as broadcast satellite links or digital TV links (...), which are capable
    of carrying IP traffic. In order to transparently integrate these links in their
    infrastructure, they may use a link-layer tunnelling mechanism such as defined
    in [RFC3077]. The purpose of this document is to attempt to identify any potential
    security implications related to this mechanism in order to help operators set
    up adequate securing mechanisms.</p>"
