abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a technique for dynamically discovering the maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) of an arbitrary CLNP path. The mechanism described here
    is applicable to both 'pure-stack' OSI as well as TUBA/CLNP environments, i.e.,
    environments where Internet transport protocols (UDP and TCP) are operated over
    CLNP. This technique might not in all cases discover the optimum Path MTU, but
    it will always choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and in many cases more accurate
    than, the Path MTU that would be chosen by current practice.</p>"
