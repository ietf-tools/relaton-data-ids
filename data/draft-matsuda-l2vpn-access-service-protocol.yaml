abstract:
- content: "<p>Access Service Network is a Network Access Provider's network. In Access
    Service Network, subscribers can connect to various ISPs/VPNs by specifying appropriate
    authentication information. This draft describes a signaling protocol based on
    PWE3 control protocol [PWE3- SIG] for Access Service Network which uses IEEE 802.1x
    as a user authentication protocol. The protocol sets up a special kind of VPLS
    which does not forward broadcast/multicast Ethernet frames between subscribers
    for better security.</p>"
