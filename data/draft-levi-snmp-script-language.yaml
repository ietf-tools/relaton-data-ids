abstract:
- content: "<p>The development of sophisticated network management applications based
    on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) often requires automation of
    complex series of SNMP requests. Writing code for performing these requests can
    become a considerable burden. Programmers must write code for building VarBind
    lists, Pdu structures, and Authentication structures, and for parsing these structures.
    Programmers must deal with multiplexing multiple SNMP requests along with any
    other I/O that the application must handle.</p>"
