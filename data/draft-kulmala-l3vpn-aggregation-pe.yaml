abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes operation of aggregation PE and applications
    for it. Aggregation PE installs VPN-IPv4 routes into VRFs and acts as BGP next
    hop when it readvertises VPN-IPv4 routes with MP-BGP to other PE routers. This
    eliminates the need to LSP connectivity (or some other type of tunnels) between
    packet's ingress and egress PE.</p>"
