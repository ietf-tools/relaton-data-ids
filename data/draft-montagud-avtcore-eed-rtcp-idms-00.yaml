abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7272 defines two RTCP messages to enable Inter-Destination Media
    Synchronization (IDMS). However, if such RTCP messages are exchanged using the
    Regular RTCP reporting rules specified in RFC 3550, unacceptable delays can be
    originated when exchanging the synchronization information conveyed into RTCP
    packets. Accordingly, this document proposes Early Event-Driven (EED) RTCP reporting
    rules and messages to enable higher interactivity, dynamism, flexibility and accuracy
    when using RTP/RTCP for IDMS. Such IDMS extensions are targeted at providing faster
    reaction on dynamic situations, such as out-of-sync situations and channel change
    delays, as well as a finer granularity for synchronizing media-related events,
    while still adhering to the RTCP bandwidth bounds specified in RFC 3550. Besides,
    a new RTP/AVPF transport layer feedback message is proposed to allow the request
    of re-IDMS setting instructions (e.g., in case of RTCP packet loss) as well as
    rapid accommodation of latecomers in on-going sessions. Finally, this document
    also discusses various situations in which the reporting of Reduced-Size RTCP
    packets (RFC 3556) can be applicable and beneficial for IDMS.</p>"
