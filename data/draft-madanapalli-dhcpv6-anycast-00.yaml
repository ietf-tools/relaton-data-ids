abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new option in DHCPv6 for Anycast/Shared
    Unicast Address assignment for a particular type of service that DHCPv6 Client
    provides. This address assignment is much similar to other address types assignments,
    except that Anycast Address assignment requires the specification of Service Type
    of the Anycast or Shared Unicast Address.</p>"
