abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6296 introduces IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6).
    By deploying NPTv6, a site can achieve addressing independence without contributing
    to excessive routing table growth. Section 2.4 of RFC 6296 proposes an NPTv6 architecture
    for sites that are homed to multiple upstream providers. By deploying the proposed
    architecture, a multihomed site can achieve access redundancy and load balancing,
    in addition to addressing independence. This memo proposes an alternative NPTv6
    architecture for hosts that are homed to multiple upstream providers. The architecture
    described herein provides transport-layer survivability, in addition to the benefits
    mentioned above. In order to provide transport-layer survivability, the architecture
    described herein requires a small amount of additional configuration. This memo
    updates RFC 6296.</p>"
