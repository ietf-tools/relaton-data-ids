abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT) Workshop took
    place on December 4th and 5th of 2013. The focus of the workshop was on models
    to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols, with particular emphasis at the
    waist of the hourglass. This report summarizes contributions and discussions.
    As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set of recommendations for
    IETF participants to pursue at this time. Instead, in the classic sense of early
    research, we note areas that deserve further exploration.</p>"
