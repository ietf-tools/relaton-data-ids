abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to apply opportunistic security between
    adjacent nodes on an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or between end points of an
    LSP. It explains how keys may be agreed to enable encryption, and how key identifiers
    are exchanged in encrypted MPLS packets. Finally, this document describes the
    applicability of this approach to opportunistic security in MPLS networks with
    an indication of the level of improved security as well as the continued vulnerabilities.
    This document does not describe security for MPLS control plane protocols.</p>"
