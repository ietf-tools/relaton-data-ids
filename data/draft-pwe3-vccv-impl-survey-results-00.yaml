abstract:
- content: "<p>Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
    the use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate the services for which
    the encapsulations have been defined. However, some encapulations treat the Control
    Word as optional. As a result, implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for
    which it is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and service
    provider network. Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
    supports three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity Verification
    (CV) Types. This flexibility has led to reports of interoperability issues within
    deployed networks and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation. This
    survey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determine implementation
    trends. The survey and results is presented herein.</p>"
