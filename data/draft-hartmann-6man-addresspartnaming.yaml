abstract:
- content: <p>In the daily communication between technicians, engineers and other
    people who need to deal with computer networks, it is often necessary to refer
    to particular parts of IP addresses. In the world of IPv4, the term "octet" is
    well established, however as the use of IPv6 is spreading, it becomes apparent
    that there is no such commonly accepted term for IPv6 addresses. Discussing and
    explaining technical matters become difficult when different people use different
    terms for the same thing. Therefore, this document discusses several naming proposal
    for those 16bit pieces of IPv6 addreses.</p>
