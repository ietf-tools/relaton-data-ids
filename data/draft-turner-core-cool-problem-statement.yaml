abstract:
- content: "<p>A significant part of the next tens of billion of devices that will
    be connected to the Internet will be constrained devices, connecting over constrained
    networks. Managing these devices and the networks they form in a consistent, scalable,
    extensible, secure, energy- efficient manner with low computational and protocol
    complexity cannot be done in an ad-hoc manner. This document outlines the problem
    at hand and provides a roadmap of the possible solutions develped at the IETF.
    The description includes the basic constrained management problem, as well as
    properties of the solution. Details as to the Constrained Objecs Language (CoOL)
    protocol itself can be found in companion documents.</p>"
