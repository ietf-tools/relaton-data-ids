abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the format of an electronic signature that can
    remain valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to its validity even
    if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny (i.e., repudiates) the
    validity of the signature. The format can be considered as an extension to RFC
    3852 and RFC 2634, where, when appropriate, additional signed and unsigned attributes
    have been defined. The contents of this Informational RFC amount to a transposition
    of the ETSI Technical Specification (TS) 101 733 V.1.7.4 (CMS Advanced Electronic
    Signatures -- CAdES) and is technically equivalent to it. The technical contents
    of this specification are maintained by ETSI. The ETSI TS and further updates
    are available free of charge at: http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Standards/StandardsDownload.aspx
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
