abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides a number of operational modes that a manufacturer
    of devices that include IEEE 802.1AR IDevID certificates may choose from. Different
    ways of generating and signing the needed keypairs are detailed, and the security
    tradeoffs of each method are considered. This document provides a nomenclature
    for each mode. IDevID certificates are used in ANIMA's BRSKI Manufacturer Authorized
    Signing Authority (MASA) process.</p>"
