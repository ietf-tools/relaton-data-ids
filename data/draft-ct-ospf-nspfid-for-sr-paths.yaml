abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the advertisement of Non Shortest Path Forwarding
    IDentifier (NSPF ID) TLV and the computation procedures for the same in OSPFv2
    and OSPFv3 protocols. NSPF ID allows to simplify the data plane path description
    of data traffic in SR deployments. This helps to mitigate the MTU issues that
    are caused by additional SR overhead of the packet and allows traffic statistics.</p>"
