abstract:
- content: '<p>This draft describes the Data reAchaBility BasEd Routing (DABBER) protocol,
    which has been developed to extend the reached of Named Data Networking based
    routing approaches to opportunistic wireless networks. By "opportunistic wireless
    networks" it is meant multi-hop wireless networks where finding an end-to-end
    path between any pair of nodes at any moment in time may be a challenge. The goal
    is to assist in better defining opportunities for the transmission of Interest
    packets towards the most suitable data source, based on metrics that provide information
    about: i) the availability of different data sources; ii) the availability and
    centrality of neighbor nodes; iii) the time lapse between forwarding Interest
    packets and receiving the corresponding data packets. The document presents an
    architectural overview of DABBER followed by specification options related to
    the dissemination of name-prefix information to support the computation of next
    hops, and the ranking of forwarding options based on the best set of neighbors
    to ensure a short time-to-completion.</p>'
