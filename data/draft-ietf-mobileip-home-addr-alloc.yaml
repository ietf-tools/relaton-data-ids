abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC2002 defines a method for a Mobile Node to be assigned a Home Agent
    dynamically through the use of a limited broadcast message. However, most corporate
    networks do not allow such packets to traverse through their firewall, which renders
    this feature difficult to use. This draft introduces new entity named the Home
    Domain Allocation Agency (HDAA) that can dynamically assign a Home Address to
    the Mobile Node. This draft also proposes a method for the HDAA to assign a dynamic
    Home Agent to the Mobile Node.</p>"
