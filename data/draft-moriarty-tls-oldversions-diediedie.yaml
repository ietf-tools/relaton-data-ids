abstract:
- content: "<p>This document [if approved] formally deprecates Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1 [RFC4346] and moves these documents to the
    historic state. These versions lack support for current and recommended cipher
    suites, and various government and industry profiiles of applications using TLS
    now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLSv1.2 has been the recommended
    version for IETF protocols since 2008, providing sufficient time to transition
    away from older versions. Products having to support older versions increase the
    attack surface unnecessarily and increase opportunities for misconfigurations.
    Supporting these older versions also requires additional effort for library and
    product maintenance. This document updates the backward compatibility sections
    of TLS RFCs [[list TBD]] to prohibit fallback to TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. This document
    also updates RFC 7525.</p>"
