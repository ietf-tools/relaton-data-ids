abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that describes the times at
    which network links are available for use. The model is intended for use in networks
    where links can be predictably lost and re- established, and neighbors may change
    as a function of time. The intent is for this information to be used by a Time-Variant
    Routing (TVR) system which may route network traffic based on mobility, energy
    costs or expected user data volumes, and handle such predictable changes in a
    non-disruptive manner.</p>"
