abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the data model and the requirements for Media
    Policy, i.e. a set of rules associated with the media distribution of the conference.
    This document also presents the requirements for the media manipulations that
    can be done using these rules by conference participants or third parties using
    any kind of media/ conference policy control protocol. This document does not
    address the interface between the focus and the media policy.</p>"
