abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a set of requirements for a protocol between application
    level entities, acting as proxies, and packet processing and filtering devices
    that implement policies determined by the application. The packet filters apply
    header translation and police flow rates. These requirements are considered initially
    in the context of IP telephony but may be extended further.</p>"
