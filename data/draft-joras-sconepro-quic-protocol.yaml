abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new QUIC version. The proposed wire format
    and a set of procedures can be used to communicate network properties between
    a content endpoint and an on-path device. This is achieved by sending messages
    in this new QUIC version format adjacent to already established QUIC version 1
    or version 2 connections on the same UDP 4-tuple. The network properties are intended
    to enable self-adaptation of video media rates by content endpoints.</p>"
