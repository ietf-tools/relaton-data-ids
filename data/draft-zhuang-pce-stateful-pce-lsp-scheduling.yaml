abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a set of extensions needed to the stateful Path
    Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP), so as to enable Labeled
    Switched Path (LSP) scheduling for path computation and LSP setup/deletion based
    on the actual network resource usage duration of a traffic service in a centralized
    network environment as stated in [I.D.ietf-teas-scheduled-resources].</p>"
