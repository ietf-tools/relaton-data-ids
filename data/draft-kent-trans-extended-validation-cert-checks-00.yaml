abstract:
- content: <p>Certificate Transparency (CT) [RFC6962-bis] is a system for publicly
    logging the existence of X.509 certificates as they are issued or observed. The
    logging mechanism allows anyone to audit certification authority (CA) activity
    and detect the issuance of "suspect" certificates. Detecting mis-issuance of certificates
    is a primary goal of CT. A certificate is considered to be mis-issued if it fails
    to meet syntactic and/or semantic criteria associated with the type of certificate
    being issued. Mis-issuance can be detected by CT log servers, whose feedback to
    a CA could prompt the CA to not issue a suspect certificate. (Preventing the mis-issuance
    of such a certificate is preferable to issuing it and detecting it later.) Compliant
    CT log servers could offer these checks to a CA submitting a pre-certificate to
    be logged. These checks are intended to be used in an environment in which CAs
    optionally assert the version of the EV guidelines to which the submitted pre-certificate
    purportedly conforms. Log servers would then perform the checks of supported [CABF-EV]
    versions and include the CA's assertion and the log server's result in its Signed
    Certificate Timestamp (SCT). Monitors can also perform checks to detect suspect
    certificates on behalf of certificate Subjects. Checks performed by a Monitor
    also serve to double check log servers that claim to have checked a certificate,
    to identify those that are not doing the checks properly, e.g., because of errors,
    compromise, or conspiracy. This provides Monitors and CT clients with additional
    information when choosing which logs to use.</p>
