abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are typically characterized by high
    latency and lack of constant end to end connectivity, consistent with their use
    in deep space communications. This, however, is not the limit of application of
    Bundle Protocol (BP) and related DTN enabling technologies. Through a collection
    of Convergance Layer Adapters (CLAs), deployment overlaying the terrestrial Internet
    is a core component of DTN implementations. IPN is a integer based naming scheme
    for DTN networks. Notwithstanding cryptographic considerations, three basic components
    are necessary to enable a BP node to use the underlying Internet to communicate
    with another BP node: the IP address of the node, the CBHE Node Number (component
    of any ipn-scheme URI identifying a BP endpoint of which that node is a member),
    and the CLA which provides IP connectivity to that node. This document describes
    RRTYPE additions to DNS to enable terrestrial BP resource look-up.</p>"
