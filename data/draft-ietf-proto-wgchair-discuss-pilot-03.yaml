- content: "<p>As of this writing, many efforts aimed at streamlining various IETF
    processes are underway. One such effort is the Process and Tools, or PROTO Team.
    The PROTO Team is an IESG-driven activity focused on improving the work flow of
    approval of documents, and the tools that support this work flow. This document
    describes a pilot process designed by the PROTO Team to streamline document flow
    by allowing working group chairs to coordinate the resolution IESG DISCUSS comments.</p>"
