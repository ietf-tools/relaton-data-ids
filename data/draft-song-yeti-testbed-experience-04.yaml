abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is built upon the foundation
    provided by the Root Server System -- that is, the critical infrastructure that
    serves the DNS root zone. Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production testbed
    that aims to provide an environment where technical and operational experiments
    can safely be performed without risk to production infrastructure. This testbed
    has been used by a broad community of participants to perform experiments that
    aim to inform operations and future development of the production DNS. Yeti DNS
    is an independently- coordinated project and is not affiliated with ICANN, IANA
    or any Root Server Operator. The Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes various
    novel and experimental components including IPv6-only transport, independent,
    autonomous Zone Signing Key management, large cryptographic keys and a large number
    of component Yeti-Root Servers. These differences from the Root Server System
    have operational consequences such as large responses to priming queries and the
    coordination of a large pool of independent operators; by deploying such a system
    globally but outside the production DNS system, the Yeti DNS project provides
    an opportunity to gain insight into those consequences without threatening the
    stability of the DNS. This document neither addresses the relevant policies under
    which the Root Server System is operated nor makes any proposal for changing any
    aspect of its implementation or operation. This document aims solely to document
    technical and operational findings following the deployment of a system which
    is similar but different from the Root Server System.</p>"
