abstract:
- content: <p>A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when encryption
    is performed under a single key. This amount is called "key lifetime". This specification
    describes a variety of methods to increase the lifetime of symmetric keys. It
    provides external and internal re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and
    on block ciphers, that can be used with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM,
    CCM, CBC, CFB, OFB and OMAC.</p>
