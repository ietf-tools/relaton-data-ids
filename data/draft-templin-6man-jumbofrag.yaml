abstract:
- content: <p>Unlike Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4), Internet Protocol, version
    6 (IPv6) does not include an Identification field in the basic packet header.
    Instead, IPv6 includes a 32-bit Identification field in a Fragment Header extension
    since the architecture assumed that the sole purpose for the Identification is
    to support the fragmentation and reassembly process. This document asserts that
    per-packet Identifications may be useful for other purposes, e.g., to allow recipients
    to detect spurious packets that may have been injected into the network by an
    attacker. But, rather than defining a new extension header, this document recommends
    employing the existing Fragment Header for per-packet identification even if the
    packet itself appears as an "atomic fragment".</p>
