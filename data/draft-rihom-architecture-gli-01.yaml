    (GLI) system is described. It manages the latest geographical location information
    and identifier of mobile nodes on the Internet. Each node registers its geographical
    location information to this system, and users can look-up identifiers of nodes
    by specifying location as a key, and vice versa. This system was designed with
    consideration of privacy protection of mobile nodes and scalability.</p>"
