abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949) is
    a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version
    negotiation. In addition to the binary interchange format, CBOR from the outset
    (RFC 7049) defined a text-based "diagnostic notation" in order to be able to converse
    about CBOR data items without having to resort to binary data. RFC 8610 extended
    this into what is known as Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN). This document consolidates
    the definition of EDN, sets forth a further step of its evolution, and is intended
    to serve as a single reference target in specifications that use EDN. It updates
    RFC 8949, obsoleting its Section 8, and RFC 8610, obsoleting its Appendix G. It
    specifies an extension point for adding application-oriented extensions to the
    diagnostic notation. It then defines two such extensions that enhance EDN with
    text representations of epoch-based date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes
    (RFC 9164). A few further additions close some gaps in usability. The document
    modifies one extension originally specified in Appendix G.4 of RFC 8610 to enable
    further increasing usability. To facilitate tool interoperation, this document
    specifies a formal ABNF grammar, and it adds media types. // (This "cref" paragraph
    will be removed by the RFC editor:) The // present revision -14 is intended to
    reflect the feedback on -13 as // discussed during IETF 121.</p>
