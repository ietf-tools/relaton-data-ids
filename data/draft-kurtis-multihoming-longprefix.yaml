abstract:
- content: "<p>In the current IP version 4 Internet, many organizations that are not
    Internet Service Providers are still getting their Internet connectivity through
    multiple providers by having address space that are announced via multiple paths.
    This is commonly referred to as multihoming. For the IP version 6 Internet, there
    have long been a debate as to how to achieve the same effect. This document addresses
    these issues by highlighting some of the current policies and how these can be
    used to achive multihoming for IP version 6 connected networks.</p>"
