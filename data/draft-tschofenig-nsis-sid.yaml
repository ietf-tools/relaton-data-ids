abstract:
- content: "<p>As one result of the analysis activities in the NSIS group it was realized
    that mobility and the ability to change the flow identifier causes problems with
    existing QoS reservations. To be able to associate a signaling message with existing
    state an identifier other than the flow identifier had to be used. Such an abstraction
    is achieved with the session identifier which allows identification of established
    state independently of the flow characteristics.</p>"
