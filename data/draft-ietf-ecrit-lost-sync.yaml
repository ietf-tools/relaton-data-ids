abstract:
- content: "<p>The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is an XML-based
    protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic location information
    to service URIs and service boundaries. In particular, it can be used to determine
    the location-appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for emergency services.
    The &lt;mapping&gt; element in the LoST protocol specification encapsulates information
    about service boundaries and circumscribes the region within which all locations
    map to the same service Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or set of URIs for a
    given service. This document defines an XML protocol to exchange these mappings
    between two nodes. This mechanism is designed for the exchange of authoritative
    &lt;mapping&gt; elements between two entities. Exchanging cached &lt;mapping&gt;
    elements, i.e., non-authoritative elements, is possible but not envisioned. Even
    though the &lt;mapping&gt; element format is reused from the LoST specification,
    the mechanism in this document can be used without the LoST protocol. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
