abstract:
- content: "<p>The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the
    discovery and selection of network services. Using this protocol, computers using
    the Internet need little or no static configuration of network services for network
    based applications. This is especially important as computers become more portable,
    and users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system administration.
    This document updates SLPv2, adding clarifications and removing features which
    were neither widely implemented or deemed useful.</p>"
