abstract:
- content: "<p>The possibility of quantum computers pose a serious challenge to cryptography
    algorithms widely today. IKEv2 is one example of a cryptosystem that could be
    broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later
    time when a quantum computer is available. It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be
    extended to support quantum secure key exchange algorithms; however that is not
    likely to happen in the near term. To address this problem before then, this document
    describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a Quantum Computer,
    by using preshared keys.</p>"
