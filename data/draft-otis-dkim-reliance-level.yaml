abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism permitting the DKIM signing domain
    to indicate different levels of reliance be given to specific messages by the
    recipient. This reliance indication is a security and safety enhancement when
    messages are selectively screened or annotated based upon generally trusted DKIM
    signing domains. Using this reliance mechanism, the signing domain better protects
    recipients by indicating low reliance levels when messages are from poorly-vetted
    sources. A low reliance level warns the recipient to increase the scrutiny given
    to such messages and also to appropriately limit message annotations. Without
    a means for a DKIM signing domain to partition the handling of their messages,
    their least vetted source may diminish the trust that might otherwise be established
    for their signed messages.</p>"
