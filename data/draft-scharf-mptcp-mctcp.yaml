abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath transport over potentially different paths can be realized
    by several coupled Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections. Multi-Connection
    TCP (MCTCP) transport aggregates multiple TCP connections between potentially
    different addresses into a single session that can be accessed by an application
    like a single TCP connection. MCTCP encodes control information, as far as possible,
    in the payload of the TCP connections and therefore requires only minor changes
    in the TCP implementations, and it is transparent in the single-path case. MCTCP
    is therefore proposed as a simple, modular, and extensible mechanism for multipath
    transport.</p>"
