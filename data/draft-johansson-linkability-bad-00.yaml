abstract:
- content: "<p>Current debate on pervasive monitoring often focus on passive attacks
    on the protocol and transport layers but even if these issues were eliminated
    through the judicious use of encryption, roughly the same information would still
    be available to an attacker who is able to (legally or otherwize) obtain access
    to linked data sets which are being maintained by large content and service providers.</p>"
