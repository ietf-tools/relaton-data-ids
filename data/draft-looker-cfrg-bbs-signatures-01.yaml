abstract:
- content: "<p>BBS is a digital signature scheme categorized as a form of short group
    signature that supports several unique properties. Notably, the scheme supports
    signing multiple messages whilst producing a single output digital signature.
    Through this capability, the possessor of a signature is able to generate proofs
    that selectively disclose subsets of the originally signed set of messages, whilst
    preserving the verifiable authenticity and integrity of the messages. Furthermore,
    these proofs are said to be zero-knowledge in nature as they do not reveal the
    underlying signature; instead, what they reveal is a proof of knowledge of the
    undisclosed signature.</p>"
