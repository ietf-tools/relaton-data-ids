abstract:
- content: "<p>The Kerberos protocol does not allow ticket extensions. This make it
    harder to deploy features like PKCROSS. Since the Kerberos protocol did not specified
    extensibility for the Ticket structure and the current implementations are aware
    of the contents of tickets, the extension protocol cannot simply extend the Ticket
    ASN.1 structure. Instead, the extension data needs to be hidden inside the ticket.
    This protocol defines two methods to add extend the tickets. The first method
    requires updated clients and is more in line with the future development of Kerberos.
    The second way does not require update client. To take advantage of this protocol
    the server (KDC or application server) need to update a well. The two methods
    are equivalent and there is a 1-1 mapping between them.</p>"
