abstract:
- content: "<p>Real deployments of wireless sensor networks (WSN) are rare, and virtually
    all have considerable limitations when node mobility is concerned. On one hand,
    research in WSNs tends to favour complex multi-hop routing protocols and, on the
    other hand, IP and mobility are considered too demanding for these environments.
    In this document we contradict this general belief by proposing an adaptation
    model for Mobile IPv6 in 6lowPANs.</p>"
