abstract:
- content: "<p>IP mobility protocols have traditionally been designed to be independent
    of any L2 considerations. A critical factor in achieving good performance for
    IP mobility protocols is its closeness to an L2 handover. Handover occurs when
    a Mobile Node moves from one radio access Point to another. If the new radio access
    point is associated with a new subnet, the routing reachability change will have
    to reflect at the access routers. Better synchronization between L2 handover and
    L3 handover are still more important when supporting fast handoff between two
    wireless domains. This draft discusses the L2 handover steps and the possible
    coupling of L2 and L3 layers to support optimize layer 3 handover. This draft
    also explores the location information as a possible L2 trigger to support optimized
    L3 handover. Also an L2 trigger message format is defined which can be handled
    at L3 independent of other protocol considerations.</p>"
