abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent proposals have suggested several kinds of key extensions for
    Mobile IP registration messages. These keys may be used between the mobile node
    and mobility agents, or between the mobility agents themselves. This document
    specifies generalized extension formats that can be useful for several kinds of
    key distributions. Each generalized extension format will have subtypes which
    indicate the specific format for the key distribution data.</p>"
