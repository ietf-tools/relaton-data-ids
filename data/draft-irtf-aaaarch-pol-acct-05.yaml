abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes policy-based accounting which is an approach
    to provide flexibility to accounting architectures. Accounting policies describe
    the configuration of an accounting architecture in a standardized way. They are
    used to instrument the accounting architecture and can be exchanged between AAA
    entities in order to share configuration information. This document describes
    building blocks and message sequences for policy-based accounting in the generic
    AAA architecture [RFC2903]. Examples are given for the usage of accounting policies
    in different scenarios. Furthermore it is shown how accounting components can
    be integrated into the AAA authorization framework [RFC2904]. This document does
    not propose a language for the description of accounting policies. It is rather
    assumed that a suitable policy language can be chosen from existing or upcoming
    standards.</p>"
