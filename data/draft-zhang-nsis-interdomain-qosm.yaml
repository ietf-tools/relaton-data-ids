abstract:
- content: "<p>This document has three goals. First of all, it presents our analysis
    of how to use the NSIS signaling (inter-domain QOSM and intra-domain QOSM) to
    fulfill the QoS control in accord with the ITU-T RACF functional architecture.
    For this goal, we discuss how the ITU-T RACF entities in the ITU-T RACF functional
    architecture can be mapped to the NSIS entities and how the RACF reference points
    can be implemented by using the NSIS protocol suites and QOSMs. Secondly, we aim
    at specifying an NSIS Inter-domain QOSM for E2E QoS control across heterogeneous
    IP networks and applying this Inter-domain QOSM to the e2e QoS control in the
    ITU-T RACF functional architecture based on the above ITU-T RACF analysis. The
    detailed description of the NSIS Inter-domain QOSM are given and the e2e QoS control
    scenarios in the ITU-T RACF architecture (including RACF Push and Pull resource
    control modes), which will be covered by the NSIS Inter-domain QOSM are described
    and implemented. Thirdly, we specify and implement those QSPECs that will be used
    by the Inter-domain QOSM for the e2e QoS control in the ITU-T RACF architecture.</p>"
