abstract:
- content: "<p>Discovery of endpoints and resources in M2M applications over large
    networks is enabled by Resource Directories, but no special consideration has
    been given to how such directories can scale beyond what can be managed by a single
    device. This document explores different ways in which Resource Directories can
    be scaled up from single network to enterprise and global scale. It does not attempt
    to standardize any of those methods, but only to demonstrate the feasibility of
    such extensions and to provide terminology and exploratory groundwork for later
    documents.</p>"
