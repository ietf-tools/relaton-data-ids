abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF, an IGP widely deployed in IP networks today, requires each LSA
    to be refreshed by the originating router every 30 minutes. This method increases
    the protocol's robustness and solves potential problems that may be caused by
    software bugs, as well as some properties of the protocol itself. Though OSPF
    expects each LSA to be refreshed independently, ABRs and ASBRs tend to originate
    Type 3/4/5 LSAs within a short period of time, thus causing periodical network
    resource exhaustion by LSA refreshments. This document discusses the techniques
    that can be used to remedy this problem and provide smooth protocol operation.
    It must be noted that discussed methods can be applied to other link-state routing
    protocols, such as IS-IS.</p>"
