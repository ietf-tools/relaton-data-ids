abstract:
- content: "<p>The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] defines a mechanism
    for tunneling PPP sessions. This document proposes mechanisms by which the L2TP
    tunneling scheme can be used to provide circuit emulation support for layer 2
    circuits (i.e. Frame Relay or ATM), as well as TDM circuits (i.e. DS1 or DS3).
    L2TP is used to provide tunneling support and each circuit is encapsulated over
    a session inside the Tunnel. An Encapsulation Services Protocol [RefESP] is used
    on top of the individual L2TP sessions to support the circuit emulation of layer
    2 VCs or TDM circuits. The purpose of this document is to explain the L2TP modifications
    done to facilitate support of circuit emulation services, as well as to define
    the additional AVPs that can be used to provide the service.</p>"
