abstract:
- content: <p>aSSURE uses industry standards and best practice to provide a secure
    communications platform for device configuration and life cycle management across
    the entire range of smart devices, from the largest servers through to more constrained
    devices, with minimal human involvement. Based on extensions to current standard
    methods, aSSURE also provides secure end to end communication across any network
    type. A new approach allows key distribution and encrypted channels to be established
    between devices that support RSA, EC and/or simple shared secrets. For devices
    that only support shared secrets, key derivation algorithms ensure that forward
    and backward compatible secrecy is supported so that secure change of ownership
    can be obtained. Owners prove ownership via a "case ID" known by the manufacturer
    and the "Trusted Authority" ID Server but not known by the device. aSSURE defines
    end-to-end encryption links, called "channels", so that pairs of devices communicate
    with a unique set of encryption keys. These unique keys, coupled with the end-to-end
    encryption, mean communication is both secure and private. DTLS supports both
    certificates and pre-shared keys, but does not cover key distribution or management.
    DTLS does not support client-specific pre-shared keys because the client cannot
    identify itself during the handshake. Herein are all the APIs required to support
    key distribution and management as well as an extension to the DTLS handshake
    that allows the client identity to be provided. aSSURE cleanly integrates with
    the Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) architecture. Both use CBOR encoded data
    with CoAP over UDP and DTLS. aSSURE URIs do not collide with OIC URIs and aSSURE
    channels can be used as a secure transport for OIC requests.</p>
