abstract:
- content: "<p>Bundled session applications such as FTP, H.323, SIP and RTSP, which
    use a signaling/control connection to establish a data/media flow, are usually
    broken, en-route, by Middleboxes such as NAT. Midcom proposes to solve this problem
    by allowing the Middlebox to be controlled through a generalized control interface
    by an application-aware entity called Midcom Agent. Since ubiquitous deployment
    of Midcom is still a few years away, an interim solution is needed to allow applications
    traverse NAT and Firewalls seamlessly without the help of embedded Application
    Layer Gateways (ALG). In this draft, a pre-Midcom solution framework is developed.
    A solution for the problem of NAT/FW traversal is needed both for the signaling
    and media/data paths. Two key components of the proposed solution are: (1) a Signaling
    Proxy server on the signaling path, and (2) a Media Proxy server on the media
    path. The Signaling server interacts with the Media server through a control interface.
    Although the primary applicability of this framework is shown for real-time RTP/UDP-based
    SIP multimedia sessions, these concepts should be generally applicable to other
    types of data sessions established through a control connection.</p>"
