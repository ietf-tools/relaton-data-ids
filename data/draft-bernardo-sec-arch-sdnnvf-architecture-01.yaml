abstract:
- content: "<p>SDN and NFV have been creating paradigm shifts across major service
    providers, governments, and industries. In most recent months, these two novel
    frameworks created jitters and excitements across major academic institutions
    and communities of practice. While these are considered disruptive to major network
    infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN and NFV nonetheless bring network
    resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, most importantly, lower long-term
    operational expenditures. They create opportunities for innovation that engage
    key players from networks, security, and software to develop new software controllers,
    APIs, networks, and technologies. This document aims to propose a formal security
    architecture that overarches important aspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks. The
    architecture can be elaborated and modified as these two frameworks mature over
    time.</p>"
