abstract:
- content: "<p>To determine which domain is allowed to claim ownership of a certain
    telephone number is difficult. This may cause problems when to authenticate endpoints
    that use telephone number URIs and domain names in their From address. This document
    investigates a proposal that stores a public key below the corresponding ENUM
    tree in the DNS. The verifier can determine ownership by performing an ENUM lookup
    to retrieve the public key from the DNS and to use it for verifying the signature
    created as part of the SIP Identity mechanism. This document is a contribution
    to the ongoing discussion on RFC 4474 when used in combination with E.164 numbers.</p>"
