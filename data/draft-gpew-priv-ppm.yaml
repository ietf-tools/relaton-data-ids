abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many situations in which it is desirable to take measurements
    of data which people consider sensitive. In these cases, the entity taking the
    measurement is usually not interested in people's individual responses but rather
    in aggregated data. Conventional methods require collecting individual responses
    and then aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy and rendering
    many such measurements difficult and impractical. This document describes a multi-party
    privacy preserving measurement (PPM) protocol which can be used to collect aggregate
    data without revealing any individual user's data.</p>"
