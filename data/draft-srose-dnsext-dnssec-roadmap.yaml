abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security (DNSSEC)technology is comprised of extensions to the Domain
    Name System (DNS) protocol that provide data integrity and authentication to security
    aware resolvers and applications through the use of cryptographic digital signatures.
    Several documents exist to describe these extensions and the implementation specific
    details regarding specific digital signing schemes. The interrelationship between
    these different documents is discussed here. A brief overview of what to find
    in which document and author guidelines for what to include in new DNS Security
    documents, or revisions to existing documents, is described</p>"
