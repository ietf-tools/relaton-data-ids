abstract:
- content: "<p>Monee allows people to operate a currency under a domain name, using
    a monetary system that expresses value added, not debt. Currency is intentionally
    created where and when value is added, and destroyed where and when value is destroyed.
    Inflation is possible, but revealed as a temporary blot on a currency. New currencies
    are bootstrapped locally and may then expand in expanding circles.</p>"
