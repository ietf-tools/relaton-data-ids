abstract:
- content: <p>When RFC 6724 was published it defined an address selection algorithm
    along with a default policy table, and noted a number of examples where that policy
    table might benefit from adjustment for specific scenarios. It also noted that
    it is important for implementations to provide a way to change the default policies
    as more experience is gained. This update draws on several years of such operational
    experience to refine RFC 6724, with emphasis on preference for the use of ULA
    addresses over IPv4 addresses and the addition of mandatory support for Rule 5.5.
    It also defines the concept of "known-local" ULA prefixes and the means by which
    nodes can identify them and insert them into their policy table such that local
    ULA-to- ULA communications become preferred over GUA-to-GUA for local use. The
    update also demotes the preference for 6to4 addresses. These changes to default
    behavior improve supportability of common use cases, including automatic / unmanaged
    scenarios. It is recognized that some less common deployment scenarios may require
    explicit configuration or custom changes to achieve desired operational parameters.</p>
