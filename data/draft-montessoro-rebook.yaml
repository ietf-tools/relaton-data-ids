- content: "<p>This document describes REBOOK, a resource reservation algorithm for
    deterministic and fast dynamic resource allocation and release. Based on a stateful
    approach, it handles faults and network errors, and recovers from route changes
    and unexpected flows shutdown. The distributed scheme used to store flows information
    have guaranteed constant complexity.</p>"
