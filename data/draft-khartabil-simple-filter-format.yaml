abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of changes to a
    state of a resource. The document does not describe a mechanism of how filtering
    of event notification information can be achieved. In order to enable this, a
    format is needed to enable the subscriber to choose when notifications are to
    be sent to it and what they are to contain. This document presents a solution
    in the form of an XML document format.</p>"
