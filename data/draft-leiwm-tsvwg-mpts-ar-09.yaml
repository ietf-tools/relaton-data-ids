abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath transport is an important way to improve the efficiency of
    data delivery. This document defines a multipath transport system framework in
    which application-level relays are deployed to provide the conditions to enable
    multiple paths between source and destination. In the proposed framework, endpoints
    are allowed to use multiple paths, including the default IP path and relay paths,
    to transport data in a single session. A relay path may via one or more application-level
    relays which provide application-level relay services for endpoints. This framework
    defines three kinds of logical entities including user agent, relay server and
    relay controller. Relay server provides relay service for user agents based on
    a local path-table. Relay controller manages relay servers and relay paths. User
    agent maintains multiple end-to-end paths which include a default path and multiple
    relay paths. The framework also defines a relay service control protocol named
    OpenPath protocol in control plane to manage relay servers and relay paths, and
    a profile of multipath transport protocol suite in data plane to facilitate multipath
    data transport. The multipath transport system framework can support various applications
    including applications requiring timely delivery of real-time data such as streaming
    media, and applications requiring ordered reliable delivery of stream of data
    such as file transfer.</p>"
