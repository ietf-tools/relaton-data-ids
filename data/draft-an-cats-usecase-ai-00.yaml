abstract:
- content: "<p>AI models, especially AI large models have been fastly developed and
    widely deployed to serve the needs of users and multiple industries. Due to that
    AI large models involve mega-scale data and parameters, high consumption on computing
    and network resources, distributed computing becomes a natural choice to deploy
    AI large models. This document desribes the key concepts and depolyment scenarios
    of AI large model, to demonstrate the necessity of considering computing and network
    resources to meet the requirements of AI tasks.</p>"
