abstract:
- content: <p>Early Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) deployments feature a "fat"
    Access Point (AP), which serves as a \%stand-alone interface between the wired
    and wireless network segments. However, this model raises scaling, mobility, and
    manageability issues, and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points
    (CAPWAP) protocol is meant to address these issues. CAPWAP effectively splits
    the fat AP functionality into two network elements, and the communication channel
    between these components may traverse potentially hostile hops. This document
    analyzes the security exposure resulting from the introduction of CAPWAP and summarizes
    the associated security considerations for IEEE 802.11-based CAPWAP implementations
    and deployments. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
