abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is used
    to negotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style in the case
    of Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address mode registration. This mechanism
    allows the mobile node to negotiate which type of traffic to be delivered encapsulated
    to the foreign agent while delivering other types of IP packets using direct delivery
    style. In particular, this mechanism gives the flexibility to eliminate tunnel
    overhead in the (typically) wireless medium between the mobile node and the foreign
    agent. In addition to the reduced overhead, the new mechanism makes many multicast
    and broadcast services available to the mobile node in a much more deterministic
    and efficient way.</p>"
