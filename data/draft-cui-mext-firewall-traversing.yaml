- content: "<p>This document presents a new approach for the scenario where the correspondent
    node is in a network protected by stateful firewall. The approach extends the
    mobility management procedure and enables the Return Routability related messages
    to traverse the stateful firewall and Route Optimization may also be achieved
    well in such scenario.</p>"
