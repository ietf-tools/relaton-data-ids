abstract:
- content: "<p>Satellite networks present some interesting challenges for packet networking.
    The entire topology is continually in motion, with links far less reliable than
    what is common in terrestrial networks. Some changes to link connectivity can
    be anticipated due to orbital mechanics. This document proposes a scalable routing
    architecture for satellite networks based on existing routing protocols and mechanisms,
    enhanced with scheduled link connectivity change information. This document proposes
    no protocol changes. This document presents the author's view and is neither the
    product of the IETF nor a consensus view of the community.</p>"
