abstract:
- content: "<p>Managing energy consumption of devices presents new challenges and
    issues. The EMAN Requirements draft identifies essential capabilities needed to
    accomplish this. This draft describes how an energy management system can use
    EMAN to gather and interpret data from individual devices, and how some of the
    Requirements are implemented in the model. This document focuses on Energy Reporting,
    though acknowledges and fully includes the limited control functions specified
    in the Requirements draft. Topics addressed in detail include the topology of
    power distribution, reporting mechanisms, and the various roles of devices, power
    interfaces, and components.</p>"
