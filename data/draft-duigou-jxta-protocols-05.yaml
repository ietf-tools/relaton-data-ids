abstract:
- content: "<p>The JXTA protocols defines a suite of six XML-based protocols that
    standardize the manner in which peers self-organize into peergroups, publish and
    discover peer resources, communicate, and monitor each other. The Endpoint Routing
    Protocol (ERP) is the protocol by which a peer can discover a route (sequence
    of hops) to send a message to another peer potentially traversing firewalls and
    NATs. The Rendezvous Protocol (RVP) is used for propagating a message within a
    peergroup. The Peer Resolver Protocol (PRP) is the protocol used to send a generic
    query to one or more peers, and receive a response (or multiple responses) to
    the query. The Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP) is used to publish and discover resource
    advertisements. The Peer Information Protocol (PIP) is the protocol by a which
    a peer may obtain status information about another peers. The Pipe Binding Protocol
    (PBP) is the protocol by which a peer can establish a virtual communication channel
    or pipe between one or more peers. The JXTA protocols permit the establishment
    a virtual network overlay on top of physical networks allowing peers to directly
    interact and organize independently of their network location and connectivity.
    The JXTA protocols have been designed to be easily implemented on unidirectional
    links and asymmetric transports.</p>"
