abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many scenarios in which extensions to Resource ReserVation
    Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) are required for error notication in Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-Network Interface (UNI). This document
    outlines these scenarios and specifies the required extensions to RSVP-TE. Although
    the GMPLS-UNI reference model is used to describe requirements and solutions in
    the document, the proposed extensions are equally applicable to other deployment
    scenarios such as inter-domain RSVP- TE.</p>"
