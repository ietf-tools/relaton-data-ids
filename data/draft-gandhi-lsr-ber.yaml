abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to IS-IS, OSPF, and BGP-LS Traffic
    Engineering to distribute the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Packet Error Rate (PER)
    metrics for the links that can be used for flexible algorithm and path selection
    purpose. Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network-performance
    information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring network performance or
    acting on that information, once distributed, are outside the scope of this document.</p>"
