abstract:
- content: <p>This memo defines an extension to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
    service whereby messages are sent with a priority to achieve a certain order in
    which the messages are transferred by an MTA (Message Transfer Agent). This priority
    or precedence order is used instead of the first-come-first-serve rule. This extension
    is not to be confused with "Importance of a Message" which is widely deployed
    using an email header such as Importance or even Priority or Precedence with common
    values of HIGH, NORMAL and LOW. Importance of a Message does not affect the priority
    of the transport itself in any way. Nevertheless, there may be policy defined
    relations between priorities and importance indicators. This extension uses the
    term priority in the meaning of expedited treatment of a message by the server
    according to its priority.</p>
