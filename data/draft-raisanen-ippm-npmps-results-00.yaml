abstract:
- content: "<p>Actual measurement results obtained with npmps-like [2] measurement
    setup are described and their relation to the npmps draft are discussed. The presented
    results use a subset of the npmps metric, and are presented to give an example
    of the use of the metric for reporting real results. An example of derivative
    use of measurement results is provided. A full text of the draft, including figures,
    can be downloaded in PDF format from http://www-nrc.nokia.com/netperf/results.pdf.</p>"
