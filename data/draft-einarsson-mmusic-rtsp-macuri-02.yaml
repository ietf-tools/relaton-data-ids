abstract:
- content: "<p>RTSP defines the setup and control for on demand and live streaming
    media sessions, which are delivered via an external media transport protocol such
    as RTP/UDP. RTSP does not define a mechanism to change the content during an on-going
    streaming session. Such a mechanism improves the streaming experience when a user
    browses through multiple offerings on a single streaming site. This document describes
    several methods to improve content switching. The basic principle is to re-use
    already established transport sessions (e.g. RTP/UDP sessions) and negotiate new
    content to be delivered on the existing sessions. If additional transport sessions
    are necessary, those sessions are established separately. This principle of re-using
    the RTSP control and transport sessions decreases the content switch delay to
    a large extent and improves the end-user experience. The present document defines
    a mechanism for switching to new content, both when the client already has the
    content description available and when it does not. This document additionally
    considers switching of a single media stream in a session, when several alternative
    media components are available. For instance, the content may provide several
    alternate audio tracks in different languages to be played with a single video
    stream. The principle of Fast Content Switching and Start-up is also defined in
    3GPP TS 26.234 [3GPP.26.234] for RTSP 1.0 [RFC2326].</p>"
