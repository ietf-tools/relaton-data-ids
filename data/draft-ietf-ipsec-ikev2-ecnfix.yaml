abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec (IP Security) tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation were specified
    prior to the addition of ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) to IP, with the
    potential result that ECN congestion indications could be discarded by IPsec tunnel
    decapsulators. The current ECN specification includes two ECN operating modes
    for IPsec tunnels to avoid this situation, and IKEv1/ISAKMP (Internet Key Exchange/Internet
    Security Association and Key Management Protocol) negotiation extensions to enable
    ECN to be used correctly with IPsec tunnels. To simplify this situation, IKEv2
    requires changes to tunnel decapsulation that prevent discarding of ECN congestion
    indication, obviating the need for multiple ECN operating modes and associated
    negotiation support.</p>"
