abstract:
- content: "<p>Pipelining was added to HTTP/1.1 as a means of improving the performance
    of persistent connections in common cases. While it is deployed in some limited
    circumstances, it is not widely used by clients on the open Internet. This memo
    suggests some measures designed to make it more possible for clients to reliably
    and safely use HTTP pipelining in these situations.</p>"
