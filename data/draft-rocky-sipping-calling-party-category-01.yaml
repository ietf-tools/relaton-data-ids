abstract:

    characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other important
    state that can describe the originating party. Based on the CPC parameter from
    the calling network, the called network can do some special processes related
    to the calling party category, just like override the calee's DND and some other
    barring services. This document specifies a way to deliver the calling party category
    to implement some supplementary services derived from the PSTN network.</p>"
