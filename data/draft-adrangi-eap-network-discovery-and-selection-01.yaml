abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for Service Network discovery and
    selection that could be implemented within the existing EAP specification framework.
    The purpose of Service Network discovery and selection here is to help a WLAN
    client using EAP for authentication to decide whether or not to connect to a WLAN
    Access Network, and help it select the most appropriate Mediating Network as a
    next hop for routing AAA packets in roaming situations where the WLAN Access Network
    has agreements with more than one Mediating Network affiliated with the client’s
    Home Service Network. The proposed solution has 3 components: a delivery mechanism
    for conveying Access Network and Service Network Information to a WLAN client,
    a data model/syntax for structuring the information in a generic manner, and a
    method by which the WLAN client can indicate its selection to the WLAN Access
    Network.</p>"
