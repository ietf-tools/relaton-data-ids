abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes private extensions to the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to identify the asserter
    of private user identity defined in RFC 3325. The use of these extensions is only
    applicable inside a set of administrative domains with previously agreed-upon
    policies for generation, transport and usage of such information. This document
    does NOT offer a general identity model suitable for use between different trust
    domains, or use in the Internet at large.</p>"
