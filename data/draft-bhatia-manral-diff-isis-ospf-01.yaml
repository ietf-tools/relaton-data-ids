abstract:
- content: "<p>The increasing popularity of IS-IS [IS-IS] and OSPF [OSPF] over the
    years has drawn significant attention to the relative merits and de-merits of
    one with respect to the other. This draft presents an elaborate comparison between
    the two routing protocols to explain how the features and functionalities of one
    differs from the other. Wherever applicable the differences between OSPFv2 and
    OSPFv3[OSPFv3] have also been pointed out.</p>"
