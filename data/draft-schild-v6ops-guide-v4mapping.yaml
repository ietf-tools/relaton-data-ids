abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to be a guide for network administrators
    of enterprise sized sites that employ the Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and
    who would like to introduce the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) dual-stack.
    It applies to scenarios where IPv4 subnets must be mapped to IPv6 subnets for
    management purposes while keeping the option to create IPv6 subnets in parallel
    and independently in the future with almost no restrictions; it is not meant to
    be applied to scenarios where a native IPv6 address plan can be created easily
    and without the need to map IPv4 subnets.</p>"
