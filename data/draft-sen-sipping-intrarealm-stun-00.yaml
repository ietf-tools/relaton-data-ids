abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes the use of STUN to determine whether two communicating
    endpoints are in the same realm. This draft describes the use of STUN in a peer-to-peer
    fashion between endpoints during call set-up. The call set-up may proceed in parallel
    with the STUN messaging, allowing the peers to initially exchange media using
    their public IP addresses. If the peers are in the same realm, then the media
    is switched to the private IP addresses using a SIP UPDATE or a SIP reINVITE SDP
    offer-answer exchange. With this proposal, media flows are kept within the same
    addressing realm whenever possible, thus avoiding certain network intermediaries
    and reducing bandwidth requirements on external links into the realm.</p>"
