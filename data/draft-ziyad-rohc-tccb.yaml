abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an efficient, robust, and scalable scheme for
    the compression of text-based protocols. Such protocols (e.g. SIP, SDP) when sent
    uncompressed over limited bandwidth networks (such as Cellular or the upstream
    of Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)) causes inadvertent delays in call set up. TCCB addresses
    these problems and proposes a simple mechanism to reduce the size of the messages
    and hence the recurrent delay</p>"
