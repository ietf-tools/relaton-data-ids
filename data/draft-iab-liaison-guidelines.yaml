abstract:
- content: "<p>Whenever the IETF decides to enter into a liaison relationship with
    another organization, such as a Standards Development Organization (SDO), a consortium,
    or an industrial forum, a liaison manager is appointed. The procedures used by
    the IAB to establish and maintain liaison relationships between the IETF and other
    organizations are described in RFC 4052. This document expands on the role of
    liaison managers and liaison representatives, giving guidelines on their mandate
    and the expectations, tasks, and responsibilities placed on them. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
