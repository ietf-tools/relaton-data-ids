abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a simplified method to advertise SRv6 SIDs in
    IS-IS. The SRv6 SID Block is composed of a number of continuous SIDs within the
    address range of a Locator. When a SID is assigned from the SID Block, it is described
    by an index based on the SID Block, instead of the whole 128-bit IPv6 address.</p>"
