abstract:
- content: "<p>ICP (see [RFC2186]) is a protocol allowing standardized communication
    management between caches. This document describes an extension to the ICP protocol
    whose aim is to reach the following three goals : - locating requested data more
    efficiently among a cache hierarchy, - reducing network traffic between caches
    by exchanging compressed data over different protocols, - offering a suitable
    protocol for the forthcoming techniques of push and intelligent prefetching.</p>"
