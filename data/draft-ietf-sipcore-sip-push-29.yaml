abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be
    used to wake a suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) with
    push notifications, and it also describes how the UA can send binding-refresh
    REGISTER requests and receive incoming SIP requests in an environment in which
    the UA may be suspended. The document defines new SIP URI parameters to exchange
    PNS information between the UA and the SIP entity that will then request that
    push notifications be sent to the UA. It also defines the parameters to trigger
    such push notification requests. The document also defines new feature-capability
    indicators that can be used to indicate support of this mechanism.</p>"
