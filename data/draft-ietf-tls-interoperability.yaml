- content: "<p>This document presents a number of problems encountered when implementing
    TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS Extensions for clients, and their consequences. The problems
    include servers that refuse to connect with clients supporting newer versions
    of the protocol, or that do not handle such negotiation properly. Another problem
    encountered is the incorrect use of values in the protocol messages.</p>"
