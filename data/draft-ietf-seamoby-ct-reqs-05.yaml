abstract:
- content: "<p>The success of time sensitive services like VoIP telephony, video,
    etc., in a mobile environment depends heavily on the ability to minimize the impact
    of the traffic redirection during a change of packet forwarding path. In the process
    of establishing the new forwarding path, the nodes along the new path must be
    prepared to provide similar forwarding treatment to the IP packets. The transfer
    of context information may be advantageous in minimizing the impact of host mobility
    on IP services. This document captures the set of requirements for a context transfer
    framework and the requirements for a generic context transfer protocol to carry
    the context between the context transfer peers.</p>"
