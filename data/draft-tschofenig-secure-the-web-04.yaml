abstract:
- content: "<p>The year 2011 has been quite exciting from a Web security point of
    view: a number of high-profile security incidents have gotten a lot of press attention
    but also new initiatives, such as the National Strategy for Trusted Identities
    in Cyberspace (NSTIC), had been launched to improve the Web identity eco-system.
    The NSTIC strategy paper, for example, observes problems with Internet security
    due to the widespread usage of low-entropy passwords and the lack of widely deployed
    authentication and attribute assurance services. With this memorandum we try to
    develop a shared vision for how to deal with the most pressing Web security problems.</p>"
