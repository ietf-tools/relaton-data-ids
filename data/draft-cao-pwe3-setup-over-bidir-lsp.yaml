abstract:
- content: <p>In MPLS and MPLS-TE environments pseudo wires use two unidirectional
    LSPs as PSN tunnels, the two PEs select LSP tunnels independently. In contrast
    the MPLS-TP environment supports both bidirectional and unidirectional LSPs and
    PWE may, therefore, use bidirectional LSPs as PSN tunnels. In order to use MPLS-TP
    bidirectional LSPs as a PSN tunnels for pseudo wires some modification of the
    pseudowire signaling procedures is required. This draft specifies an extension
    to LDP that ensures pseudo-wires are correctly constructed over bi-directional
    LSPs. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.</p>
