abstract:
- content: "<p>For a given OSPF (or ISIS) router within the CLOS topology, it would
    receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSA (or LSP) from multiple OSPF (or
    ISIS) neighbors. In addition, two OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors may send each other
    the same LSA (or LSP) simultaneously. The unnecessary link-state information flooding
    wastes the precious process resource of OSPF (or ISIS) routers. This document
    proposes extensions to OSPF (or ISIS) so as to reduce the OSPF (or ISIS) flooding
    within such CLOS networks. The reduction of the OSPF (or ISIS) flooding is much
    beneficial to improve the scalability of CLOS networks.</p>"
