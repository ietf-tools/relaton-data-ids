abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines an extensible method to return additional information
    about the cause of DNS errors. The primary use case is to extend SERVFAIL to provide
    additional information about the cause of DNS and DNSSEC failures. [ Open question:
    The document currently defines a registry for errors. It has also been suggested
    that the option also carry human readable (text) messages, to allow the server
    admin to provide additional debugging information (e.g: "example.com pointed their
    NS at us. No idea why...", "We don''t provide recursive DNS to 192.0.2.0. Please
    stop asking...", "Have you tried Acme Anvil and DNS? We do DNS right..." (!).
    Please let us know if you think text is needed, or if a 16bit FCFS registry is
    expressive enough. ] [ Open question: This document discusses extended *errors*,
    but it has been suggested that this could be used to also annotate *non- error*
    messages. The authors do not think that this is a good idea, but could be persuaded
    otherwise. ]</p>'
