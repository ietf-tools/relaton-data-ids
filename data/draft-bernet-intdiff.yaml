abstract:
- content: "<p>In the past several years, work on QoS enabled networks led to the
    development of the Integrated Services (Intserv) architecture [12] and the RSVP
    signaling protocol [1]. RSVP addresses the needs of applications that require
    QoS, promising per-flow service. As the RSVP/Intserv (from here on abbreviated
    to intserv) work has proceeded, we have recognized barriers to the deployment
    of intserv. The reliance of intserv on per-flow state and per-flow processing
    is an impediment to its deployment in the Internet at large, and in particular
    in large carrier networks. Additionally, RSVP signaling is supposed to originate
    from hosts, which as of yet are not RSVP enabled in large numbers. Recently, attention
    has shifted to Differentiated services (diff-serv). Diff-serv promises to expedite
    the realization of QoS enabled networks by offering a significantly simpler alternative
    to intserv, which eliminates scalability concerns and which can be implemented
    and managed in large networks, without requiring end-to-end deployment. However,
    unlike intserv, diff-serv focuses on the needs of the large network. This draft
    proposes a framework for end-to-end QoS, in which intserv and diff-serv are used
    together to meet the needs of large ISPs who manage the transit networks of the
    Internet, and the users of QoS applications and hosts, who are the ISPs' ultimate
    customers. This focus is important as we believe that in the coming years, there
    will be a proliferation of applications that depend on QoS and of hosts which
    are capable of QoS signaling. We envision the deployment of diff-serv capable
    core networks and intserv capable stub networks at the periphery. Our framework
    allows each to proceed at its own pace, providing immediate incremental benefits
    in areas of the network in which one or the other is deployed and additional benefits
    where both are deployed.</p>"
