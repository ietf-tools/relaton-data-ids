abstract:
- content: "<p>Multilinear Galois Mode (MGM) is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated
    Data (AEAD) block cipher mode based on the Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) principle. MGM
    is defined for use with 64-bit and 128-bit block ciphers. MGM has been standardized
    in Russia. It is used as an AEAD mode for the GOST block cipher algorithms in
    many protocols, e.g., TLS 1.3 and IPsec. This document provides a reference for
    MGM to enable review of the mechanisms in use and to make MGM available for use
    with any block cipher.</p>"
