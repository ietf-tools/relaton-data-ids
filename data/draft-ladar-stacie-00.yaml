abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for Safely Turning Authentication
    Credentials Into Entropy (STACIE) using an efficient Zero Knowledge Password Proof
    (ZKPP), and is provided as a standalone component suitable for use as a building
    block in other protocol development efforts. The scheme was created to fill the
    emerging need for a standard which allows a single low entropy password to be
    used for user authentication and the derivation of strong encryption keys. The
    design is modular, and is conservative in its use of an arbitrary one-way cryptographic
    hash function. The security of the scheme depends on the difficulty associated
    with reversing the hash function output back into the plaintext input. STACIE
    attempts to make discovering the plaintext input through the use of brute force
    more difficult by linking the amount of processing to the length of a user's plaintext
    password. The shorter the plaintext password the more processing time per attempt
    with the amount of additional, artificially required, work scaling exponentially
    for each character.</p>"
