abstract:
- content: <p>Many popular topologies for large-scale networks have highly regular
    structure with distinctive design pattern. Examples of such topologies include
    hub-and-spoke (also known as "star") common in enterprise WAN networks, fat-tree
    and Clos topologies common in datacenters. For number of reasons in such large-scale
    networks distance-vector protocols perform better than OSPF. On the other hand
    network backbones have no highly regular topology pattern and there OSPF outperforms
    distance-vector protocols. As a result large- scale networks frequently employ
    different routing protocols in different regions of the network, complicating
    network operations. This document proposes OSPF extensions to improve scalability
    of routing for large-scale networks.</p>
