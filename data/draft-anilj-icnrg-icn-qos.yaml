abstract:
- content: "<p>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is shaping up as an alternative
    networking mechanism for the TCP/IP based host-centric networking paradigm. Content
    delivery or streaming is one of important use cases where the real value and potential
    of ICN architecture is being investigated. While a number of studies on an optimal
    and efficient routing of Interest requests have been published, more discussion
    is needed on the mechanisms for implementation and enforcement of the quality
    of service (QoS) in the ICN based data delivery path. In this document, we focus
    on two most popular ICN architectures, CCN (Content Centric Networking) and NDN
    (Named Data Networking) and describe how we can achieve the QoS aware data delivery
    in the ICN network. We propose to use the differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS
    model based on DSCP codes, which is also used in the IP based Internet design.
    We further present how QoS parameter syntax can be added to the current CCNx messages.</p>"
