abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the Sonet/SDH traffic engineering extensions
    required for existing IGP protocols in support of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signalling
    as defined in [RFC-3471] and [GMPLS-SONET-SDH]. Using [GMPLS-RTG] as guideline,
    this memo specifies the GMPLS routing traffic engineering extensions to OSPF for
    Sonet/SDH networks. Based on the Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions defined in
    [OSPF- TE], the proposed approach is aligned with link bundling as defined in
    [MPLS-BDL] and extends the set of Link sub-TLVs proposed in [GMPLS-OSPF] to Sonet/SDH
    networks. The proposed extensions do not preclude any further integration with
    the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor specified in [GMPLS-OSPF].</p>"
