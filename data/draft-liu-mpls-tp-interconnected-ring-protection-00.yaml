abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the ring protection Requirements in RFC 5654, Requirement
    93 : When a network is constructed from interconnected rings, MPLS-TP MUST support
    recovery mechanisms that protect user data that traverses more than one ring.
    This includes the possibility of failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and links,so
    this document will describle all kinds of interconnected rings Scenario and a
    few possible solutions for recovery the failure of the ring-interconnect nodes
    and Links. . This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /
    International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
