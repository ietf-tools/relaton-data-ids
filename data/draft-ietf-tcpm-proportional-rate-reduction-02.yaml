abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental algorithm, Proportional Rate
    Reduction (PPR) to improve the accuracy of the amount of data sent by TCP during
    loss recovery. Standard Congestion Control requires that TCP and other protocols
    reduce their congestion window in response to losses. This window reduction naturally
    occurs in the same round trip as the data retransmissions to repair the losses,
    and is implemented by choosing not to transmit any data in response to some ACKs
    arriving from the receiver. Two widely deployed algorithms are used to implement
    this window reduction: Fast Recovery and Rate Halving. Both algorithms are needlessly
    fragile under a number of conditions, particularly when there is a burst of losses
    such that the number of ACKs returning to the sender is small. Proportional Rate
    Reduction minimizes these excess window reductions such that at the end of recovery
    the actual window size will be as close as possible to ssthresh, the window size
    determined by the congestion control algorithm. It is patterned after Rate Halving,
    but using the fraction that is appropriate for target window chosen by the congestion
    control algorithm.</p>"
