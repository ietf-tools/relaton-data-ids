abstract:
- content: "<p>By default, The Border Gateway Protocol, BGP only installs the best-
    path to the IP Routing Table. BGP multi-path is a well known feature that enables
    installation of multiple paths to the IP Routing Table. This is done to achieve
    load balancing while forwarding traffic. For a path to be eligible as a multi-path,
    certain criteria need to be fulfilled. Inter-AS VPNs are commonly deployed to
    span organizations across Service Provider boundaries. In this draft, we describe
    an issue relating to multi-path load balancing that can arise in an Option B Inter-AS
    Deployment. With the help of a representative topology, we illustrate the problem
    and then present two simple schemes as the solution to the problem. We also note
    as a matter of independent interest that the same underlying issue is applicable
    to deployments that employ next-hop-self behavior (implicit or explicit) downstream
    and the multi-path feature upstream.</p>"
