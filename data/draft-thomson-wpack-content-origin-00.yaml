abstract:
- content: "<p>Making content available to clients that are unable or unwilling to
    contact a web origin enables new means of acquiring content. This document describes
    a method for taking application state accumulated by an offline user agent in
    relation to a piece of content and making that state available in a fully online
    context. This enables continuous use of content, starting from a state where the
    user agent does not contact an origin and ending with This document proposes an
    update to the definition of Origin in RFC 6454. It also proposes changes that
    would affect HTML, which is outside of the remit of the IETF.</p>"
