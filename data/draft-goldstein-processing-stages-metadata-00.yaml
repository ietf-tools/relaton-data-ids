abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a set of objects extending the Content Delivery
    Network Interconnection (CDNI) metadata model to allow for metadata to be applied
    conditionally and at various points in a dCDNs processing of requests. The concept
    of Processing Stages are introduced, where each stage in a CDN's processing pipeline
    presents an opportunity to examine requests and responses and make alterations
    as needed. Metadata, such as caching rules, can be applied conditionally (based
    on aspects of an HTTP request header), and HTTP responses from a source can be
    altered dynamically (such as adding or dropping an HTTP header). This standard
    leverages the expression language documented in the Metadata Expression Language
    (MEL) Specification.</p>"
