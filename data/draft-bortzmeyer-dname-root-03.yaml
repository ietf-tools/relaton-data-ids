abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents asks IANA to add DNAME records in the DNS root zone
    for TLDs which are in the Special-Use Domain Names registry, in order to ensure
    they receive an appropriate reply (NXDOMAIN) and that the root nameservers are
    not too bothered by them. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: there is no obvious place
    to discuss this document. May be the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through
    its mailing list (the author reads it). Or may AS112 operators mailing lists?
    The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently kept
    at Github [1].</p>"
