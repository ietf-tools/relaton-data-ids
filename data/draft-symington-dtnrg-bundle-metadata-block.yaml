abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension block that may be used with the
    Bundle Protocol [2] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture
    [4]. This Metadata Extension Block is designed to be used to carry metadata that
    forwarding nodes can use to make routing and other decisions regarding the bundle.
    This block is defined to enable the actual metadata that is inserted into the
    block to have any content and format, providing the format has been documented
    as a metadata ontology. Specific metadata ontologies may be defined in additional
    documents.</p>"
