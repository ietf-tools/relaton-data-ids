abstract:
- content: "<p>Being the widely used transport protocol in Internet, TCP might be
    influenced by the congestion occurred in those nodes (i.e., routers, IP/ATM access
    nodes, and ATM switches) along the travelling path. Since TCP relies on the end-to-end
    window-based mechanism to explain the congestion, there is limited room for intermediate
    network elements to explicitly contribute to the TCP control. However, in huge
    pipe networks, TCP might be ineffective because it starts decreasing its rate
    just after it senses packet's loss, implying that the network has already been
    congested somewhere. A general mechanism of delaying ACKs in congested nodes is
    presented in this draft to connect the traffic control of TCP with that of network
    elements. This mechanism can be considered as an enhancement to the currently
    prevalent TCP and referred to Fast-TCP. The basic idea of Fast-TCP arises from
    the fact that controlling ACK flows can indirectly affect the dynamics of TCP's
    behavior. ACK delay mechanism can be easily implemented in various network nodes
    where information of link utilization or buffer occupancy may be employed to notify
    the congestion. By using ACK delay policy at IP routers in a complex network,
    we present the simulation results to show that this policy achieves good TCP throughput
    and reduces the buffer requirement.</p>"
