abstract:
- content: <p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is widely deployed at TLD and other
    important domain names currently. DNSSEC is an effective method to provide security
    protection for end users in the network. DNSSEC needs a lot of operations to maintain
    the chain of trust, like DNSKEY rollover operations periodically. But the chain
    of trust could be broken if the operator of domain replaces the old key immediately
    in a emergency rollover operation when the key is compromised. The break will
    make the domain and his sub-domains invisible in a short time if the data in the
    cache of resolver is right, on the contrary, the fake RR in the cache of resolver
    may be "valid" if the resolver is under the attack from hackers. This document
    introduces the compromised-key digest signature (CKDS) resource record to mitigate
    the impact of invalidation which is due to emergency rollover from the authoritative
    name server.</p>
