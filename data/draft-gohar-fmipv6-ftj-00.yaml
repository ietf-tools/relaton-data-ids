abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a fast handover mechanism to provide seamless
    multicast services in the wireless/mobile networks based on the Fast Mobile IPv6
    (FMIPv6). When a mobile node (MN) moves from one access router to another, it
    may encounter data loss. In the tree joining case of the existing scheme, there
    is a problem of buffer overflow during the packet forwarding from Previous Access
    Router (PAR) to New Access Router (NAR), in which many packet losses may occur
    due to the buffer overflow. In order to reduce this buffer overflow and the concerned
    packet losses, we propose a new scheme of a fast tree join for seamless multicast
    handover, which allows the NAR to join the multicast tree before the FMIPv6 handover
    is completed. In the proposed scheme, we consider the two specific cases: 1) the
    short tree joining time, in which no packet forwarding will be required and thus
    NAR can receive the multicast data from an upstream multicast router before the
    FMIPv6 handover is completed, 2) the long tree joining time, in which the packet
    forwarding will be required and thus NAR will receive the multicast data after
    the FMIPv6 handover.</p>"
