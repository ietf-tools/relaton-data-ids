abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of network technology, the satellite network are
    gradually integrating with the terrestrial network. This draft illustrates a satellite
    ground routing architecture based on access satellite prediction to solve the
    end-to-end communication issue in the satellite ground integration scenario where
    the connection between terrestrial nodes and satellites switches frequently. This
    architecture includes registration nodes which are responsible for maintaining
    access node information. Each access node preserve satellite orbit information,
    performs access satellite prediction, and generates encapsulation addresses. The
    access satellite undertakes data encapsulation, data forwarding, and data unencapsulation
    based on encapsulation addresses.</p>"
