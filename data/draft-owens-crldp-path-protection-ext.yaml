abstract:
- content: "<p>To deliver reliable service, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS)
    requires a set of procedures to enable protection of the traffic carried on label
    switched paths (LSPs). Thus existing signaling mechanisms must be extended appropriately
    to support such functionality. Recently, CR-LDP [1] has introduced extensions
    to LDP to support the establishment of LSP tunnels. This draft extends CR- LDP
    to support path protection [2]in MPLS. Specifically, we provide signaling support
    for establishing working and backup LSPs.</p>"
