abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the registration of the Short Message Service (SMS)
    as a registered IANA service selector for Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN)
    numbers. SMS is not available for all GSTN subscribers, but it has proven very
    popular with users of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), and has
    also been adapted to other telephone network technologies such as the Integrated
    Services Digital Network (ISDN).</p>"
