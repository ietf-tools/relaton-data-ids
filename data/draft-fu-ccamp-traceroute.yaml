abstract:
- content: "<p>We identify some issues for generic traceroute for tunnels (tunnel-
    trace): (1) it is possible that some IP hops do not support tunneltrace, (2) for
    each tunnel wishing to be traced, at least the two end points should support the
    tunneltrace, (3) tracing message should be able to by-pass firewalls and NATs.
    One possible solution, based on the CASP signaling protocol (stateless mode),
    is proposed to support generic routetracing over tunnels.</p>"
