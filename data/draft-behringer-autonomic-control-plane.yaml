abstract:
- content: <p>In certain scenarios, for example when bootstrapping a network, it is
    desirable to automatically bring up a secure, routed control plane, which is independent
    of device configurations and global routing table. This document describes an
    approach for an "Autonomic Control Plane", which can be used as a "virtual out
    of band channel" - a self-managing overlay network, which is independent of configuration,
    addressing and routing on the data plane.</p>
