abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a means to identify component links that are
    bundled within an unnumbered interface. This feature is required during Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
    that utilize such component links. Similarly, it is useful in error reporting
    for such LSPs.</p>"
