abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to achieve further slicing or traffic engineering
    interoperability between vendors without the use of SRH. Slicing or traffic engineering
    information is encapsulated as part of the SRv6 SID. Use of IP longest prefix
    match approach to identify the further slicing via sub- slice identifier. The
    traffic engineering from one end to another end is seen as segment by segment
    approach. This approach could solve the scalability of traffic engineering tunnels
    required in a huge network, which order of N^2 has be considered.</p>"
