abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Internet Draft to
    include the reception and transmission of Any Source Multicast traffic at the
    Mobile Node. It introduces handover mechanisms for IPv6 mobile multicast listeners
    and mobile multicast senders. Operations are based on a Mobile IPv6 environment
    with local mobility anchor points. These local anchor points are conformal with
    a Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 proxy infrastructure. Handover latencies in the proposed
    scheme remain bound to link switching delays with respect to these local proxy
    points. Thus the M-HMIPv6 achieves seamless mobility, even though no bicasting
    of multicast streams is used. Multicast listeners in addition encounter the option
    to optimize multicast routing by turning to a direct data reception. The mechanisms
    described in this document do not rely on assumptions of any specific multicast
    routing protocol in use. The M-HMIPv6 protocol operations utilize the existing
    HMIPv6, MIPv6 and MLDv2 messages under minor extensions.</p>"
