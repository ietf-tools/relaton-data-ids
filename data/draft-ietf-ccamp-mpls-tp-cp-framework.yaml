abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning of
    transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS) and dynamic provisioning
    of transport paths via a control plane. This document provides the framework for
    MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning and covers control-plane addressing, routing, path
    computation, signaling, traffic engineering, and path recovery. MPLS-TP uses GMPLS
    as the control plane for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs). MPLS-TP also uses
    the pseudowire (PW) control plane for pseudowires. Management-plane functions
    are out of scope of this document. This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within
    the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support
    the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined
    by the ITU-T. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
