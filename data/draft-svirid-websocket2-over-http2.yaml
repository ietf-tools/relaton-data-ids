abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new protocol called WebSocket2 ontop of HTTP/2.
    The WebSocket2 protocol enables two-way binary communication between a client
    running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in
    to communications from that code. This protocol has little incommon with the WebSocket
    protocol [RFC6455] other than client side API compatibility. Please send feedback
    to the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list.</p>"
