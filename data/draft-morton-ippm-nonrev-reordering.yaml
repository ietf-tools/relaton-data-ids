abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a simple metric to determine if a network has maintained
    packet sequence. It provides motivations for the new metric, suggests a metric
    definition, and discusses the issues associated with measuring packet sequence.
    The memo includes secondary metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several
    useful dimensions. Some examples of evaluation using the non- reversing sequence
    criterion are included.</p>"
