abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a directory server that implements the SCIM
    protocol and schema [, its capabilities and access control model], and optional
    support for LDAPv3 protocol. This specification extends SCIM from provisioning
    to a general purpose access protocol in support of data management applications
    (e.g. self-service systems) and RESTful clients that need read/write access to
    a directory on the Internet, between domains, or within a cloud.</p>"
