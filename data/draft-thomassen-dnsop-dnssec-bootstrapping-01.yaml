abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an authenticated in-band method for automatic
    signaling of a Child DNS zone's delegation signer information from the zone's
    DNS operator(s). The zone's registrar or registry may subsequently use this signal
    for automatic DS record provisioning in the parent zone. The protocol is particularly
    useful in case of managed DNS providers hosting registrant's domains, where DS
    provisioning has so far been cumbersome. The signaling channel is not specific
    to the DS bootstrapping use case, but equally suitable for announcing other zone-specific
    information from the DNS Operator in an authenticated fashion. Further potential
    applications thus include, for example, key exchange between parties in an [RFC8901]
    multisigner setup. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background
    information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc. They
    will be removed before publication. This document is being collaborated on at

    open issues, etc. should all be available there. The authors gratefully accept
