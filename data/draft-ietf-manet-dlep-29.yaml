abstract:
- content: "<p>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless
    links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link
    (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions. In mobile or other environments
    where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference
    of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make
    the best decisions. This document introduces a new protocol called the Dynamic
    Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP), which provides a bidirectional, event-driven communication
    channel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication of changing
    link characteristics.</p>"
