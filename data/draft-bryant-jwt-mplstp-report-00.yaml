abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC archives the report of the IETF - ITU-T Jooint Working Team
    (JWT) on the application of MPLS to Transport Networks. The JWT recommended of
    Option 1: The IETF and the ITU-T jointly agree to work together and bring transport
    requirements into the IETF and extend IETF MPLS forwarding, OAM, survivability,
    network management and control plane protocols to meet those requirements through
    the IETF Standards Process. There are two versions of this RFC. An ASCII version
    that contains a summary of the slides and a pdf version that contains the summary
    and a copy of the slides.</p>"
