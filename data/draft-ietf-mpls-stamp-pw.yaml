abstract:
- content: "<p>Pseudowires (PWs) and Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are used in MPLS
    networks for various services including carrying layer 2 and layer 3 data packets.
    This document describes the procedure for encapsulation of the Simple Two-Way
    Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined in RFC 8762 and its optional extensions
    defined in RFC 8972 for PWs and LSPs in MPLS networks. The procedure uses Generic
    Associated Channel (G-ACh) to encapsulate the STAMP test packets with or without
    adding an IP/UDP header.</p>"
