abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment routing is a source routed forwarding method that allows packets
    to be steered through a network on paths other than the shortest path derived
    from the routing protocol. The approach uses information encoded in the packet
    header to partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through the
    network, and does not make use of a signaling protocol to pre-install paths in
    the network. Two different encapsulations have been defined to enable segment
    routing in an MPLS network or in an IPv6 network. While acknowledging that there
    is a strong need to support segment routing in both environments, this document
    defines a mechanism to carry MPLS segment routing packets encapsulated in UDP.
    The resulting approach is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks without the
    need for any changes to the IP or segment routing specifications. This document
    makes no changes to the segment routing architecture and builds on existing protocol
    mechanisms such as the encapsulation of MPLS within UDP defined in RFC 7510. No
    new procedures are introduced, but existing mechanisms are combined to achieve
    the desired result.</p>"
