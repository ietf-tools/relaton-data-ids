abstract:
- content: "<p>Overload occurs in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) when SIP servers
    have insufficient resources to process all SIP messages they receive. The SIP
    protocol specified in RFC 3261 provides the 503 (Service Unavailable) response
    code as a remedy for servers under overload. However, the current definition of
    503 (Service Unavailable) has problems and can in fact amplify an overload condition.
    This document proposes an essential correction to RFC 3261 that avoids these problems
    and helps SIP servers to better cope with overload.</p>"
