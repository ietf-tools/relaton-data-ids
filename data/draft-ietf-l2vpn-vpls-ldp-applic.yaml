abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a layer 2 VPN service that provides
    multipoint connectivity in the form of an Ethernet emulated LAN, while usual L2
    VPN services are typically point-to-point. Such emulated LANs can span across
    metropolitan area networks as well as wide area networks. [VPLS-LDP] defines a
    method for signaling MPLS connections between member PEs of a VPN and a method
    for forwarding Ethernet frames over such connections. This document describes
    the applicability of such procedures to provide VPLS services. This document also
    compares the characteristics of this solution against the requirements specified
    in [L2VPN-REQ]. In summary, there are no architectural limitations to prevent
    the requirements from being met. But meeting certain requirements (e.g. QoS) is
    beyond the specification of [VPLS-LDP], and requires careful planning and precise
    implementation of the Service Provider (SP) networks. This document attempts to
    capture such issues, presents the potential solutions to these issues, and discusses
    the pros and cons of each alternative. This document does not cover the applicability
    of [VPLS-BGP].</p>"
