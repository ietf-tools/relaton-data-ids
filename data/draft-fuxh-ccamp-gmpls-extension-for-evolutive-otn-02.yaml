abstract:
- content: <p>This document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) signaling documents. It describes the technology- specific information
    needed to extend GMPLS signaling to control Optical Transport Networks (OTN) based
    on ITU-T G.709 Amendment 3 reccomandation. References also to G.sup43 are provided.
