abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how an HTTP GET request to an HTTP-Enabled
    Location Delivery (HELD) resource is handled by the server responsible for that
    resource. This ensures that requests generated by user agents that are unaware
    of the special status of a URI do not result in unhelpful responses and enables
    the use of HTTP GET for location configuration and dereference.</p>"
