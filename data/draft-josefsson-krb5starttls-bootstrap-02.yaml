abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how clients can use the Kerberos V5 over TLS
    protocol together with its long term key to 1) avoid having to validate the server
    certificate, 2) securely learn a KDC's server certificate, and 3) learn the trust
    anchors used by the KDC. We also describe how the Kerberos V5 over TLS protocol
    can be used to 4) avoid the need for a long term shared key between the client
    and the KDC by instead using TLS client authentication. These goals are achieved
    by introducing a new Kerberos V5 pre- authentication type that modify how the
    Kerberos V5 reply key is derived.</p>"
