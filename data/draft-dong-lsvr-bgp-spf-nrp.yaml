abstract:
- content: "<p>A VTN is a virtual underlay network which has customized network topology
    and a set of dedicated or shared network resources. Network Resource Partition
    (NRP) refers to a set of network resources that are available to carry traffic
    and meet the SLOs and SLEs. Multiple NRPs can be created in a network to provide
    different Virtual Transport Networks (VTN) to meet the requirements of different
    services or different service groups. In the context of network slicing, a VTN
    can be instantiated as a Network Resource Partition (NRP). As the number of NRP
    increases, there can be scalability concerns about using Interial Gateway Protocols
    (IGP) to distribute the NRP information in the network. In networks where BGP
    Shortest Path First (SPF) can used as the underlay routing mechanism to distribute
    the link-state information among network nodes, the information of NRPs needs
    to be distributed along with the basic network information. This document specifies
    the BGP SPF mechanisms with necessary extensions to distribute the NRP information
    and perform NRP-specific path computation.</p>"
