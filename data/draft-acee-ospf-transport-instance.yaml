abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism to disseminate
    routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) information within a routing domain.
    Given the effectiveness of these mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using
    the same mechanism for dissemination of other types of information within the
    domain. However, burdening OSPF with this additional information will impact intra-domain
    routing convergence and possibly jeopardize the stability of the OSPF routing
    domain. This document presents mechanism to relegate this ancillary information
    to a separate OSPF instance and minimize the impact.</p>"
