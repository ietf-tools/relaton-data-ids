abstract:
- content: "<p>In a mobile ad hoc network, difficulties exist in supporting address
    autoconfiguration and naming resolution due to the lack of centralized servers.
    This document presents a novel approach, called Name-Based Autoconfiguration (NBA),
    which uses host names to determine IP addresses and provides address autoconfiguration
    and name resolution as a single protocol.</p>"
