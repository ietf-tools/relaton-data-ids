abstract:
- content: "<p>In multihomed mobile networks, multiple Mobile Routers can be deployed
    to provide fault recovery or load sharing. Also, each Mobile Router (MR) can have
    a bi-directional tunnel with its own Home Agent (HA). In this multihomed mobile
    network scenario, the neighbor root MR can replace or share the operation of another
    MR. Therefore, MRs should cooperate with each other to provide session continuity
    or load sharing. We present an authentication and registration mechanism without
    introducing extra signaling messages. Using the Return Routability procedure of
    Mobile IPv6 and the Binding Update message with the neighbor MR registration option,
    the MR can authenticate and register the neighbor MR to its own HA. And the HA
    can use this registered neighbor MR information to provide fault recovery or load
    sharing.</p>"
