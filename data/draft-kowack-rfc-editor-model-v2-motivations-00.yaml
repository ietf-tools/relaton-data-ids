abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides the background and motivations for the recommendations
    made in draft-kowack-rfc-editor-model-v2-overview-00. It represents the perspectives
    resulting from an individual managerial and analytical effort of nearly one year's
    duration. It contains a summary of the factors considered to be essential to the
    job of RFC Series Editor (RSE). This includes a summary of the work done as part
    of the RFC Editor, the differences between [RFC5620]and the [I-D.v2-overview]
    recommendations, a discussion of development work that should be done, and an
    assessment of the time needed to perform the RSE job. There is also a section
    listing and responding to questions surrounding the recommendations.</p>"
