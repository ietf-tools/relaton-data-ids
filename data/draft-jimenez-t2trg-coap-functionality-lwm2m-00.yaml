abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a strawman summary of information that should
    be used for the LWM2M specification [LWM2M]. LWM2M is based on CoAP, on top of
    which it describes certain management interfaces and data models that go beyond
    the CoAP specifications itself. However LWM2M does not describe all behavior that
    should be expected from implementations of the CoAP specifications. This document
    attempts to clarify what should be present in a LWM2M system beyond what is specified
    in the LWM2M documents. Additionally, this document also adds information about
    IPSO Objects [IPSO] and their usage with LWM2M as application protocol.</p>"
