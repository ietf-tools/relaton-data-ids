abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents different scenarios of applicability for an
    MLD proxy running more than one upstream interface. Since those scenarios impose
    different requirements on the MLD proxy with multiple upstream interfaces, it
    is important to ensure that the proxy functionality addresses all of them for
    compatibility. The purpose of this document is to define the requirements in an
    MLD proxy with multiple interfaces covering a variety of applicability scenarios,
    and to specify the proxy functionality to satisfy all of them.</p>"
