abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the SIP protocol to allow it
    be used in adhoc networks or Pico Networks. It leverages the direct, client to
    client session initiation capabilities of SIP, although there may be applications
    where the redirect and proxying abilities will be important also. Note the intention
    is not to imply that SIP is inherently the best protocol for such networks, but
    to recognize that there will likely be many SIP based applications in existence
    and that it would be good to allow these applications work with as little change
    as possible in this different type of network.</p>"
