abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the translation mechanism mapping IPv6 address
    with 128 bits to the Adaptation Identifier (AID) with 16 bits. When a device in
    IEEE 802.15.4 domain needs to communicate with other nodes in IPv6 domain, it
    should acquire source AID and destination AID corresponding to source IPv6 address
    and destination IPv6 address, respectively from an IPv6 translation-capable gateway.
    The node will send packets using these AIDs to the gateway, and then the gateway
    will translate them to normal IPv6 addresses using the mapping table already associated.</p>"
