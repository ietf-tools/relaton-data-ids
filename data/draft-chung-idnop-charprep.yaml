abstract:
- content: "<p>Charprep intends to take up where Nameprep [NAMEPREP] left off to provide
    additional preventive measures to bridge the users conceptual perception of a
    multilingual domain name with the domain matching process. The critical development
    from Nameprep is that common user perception is taken into account. That is, Charprep
    strives to take the 'case-insensitivity' concept of user-friendliness to another
    level for IDNs because of the inherent complexity and potential confusion that
    could arise from the use of multilingual characters in domain names. Charprep
    is designed to be a framework for Zone Administrators (e.g. domain registries)
    to employ relevant equivalency tables to compute and generate variants from the
    original string to variants that could possibly create confusion with users. The
    actual management of Reserved Variants (RV), Zone Variants (ZV) with the original
    string (Primary Domain) will be discussed in Zoneprep [ZONEPREP]. Furthermore,
    Charprep and Zoneprep are designed to be a recommended feature to be offered to
    users by a Zone Administrator (e.g. Domain Registries) in the management of Internationalized
    domain names (IDN). A key concept is that these are done without affecting the
    IDN protocol specified in [RFC3490], [RFC3491] and [RFC3492].</p>"
