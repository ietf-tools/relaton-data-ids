abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next Steps in Signaling working group is developing a protocol
    suite for signaling information about a data flow along its path in the network.
    The lower layer in the protocol suite, the NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP)
    is intended to provide a generally useful transport service for such signaling
    messages. There is a long-running open question about how much (if at all) the
    NTLP should provide reliable message transport. There is a large amount of confusion
    about what this question even means, let alone how to answer it. This document
    identifies the possible reliability requirements for signaling protocols in general,
    based on past evaluations of RSVP and research in soft-state protocol performance.
    It makes a proposal for what kind of reliable transport functionality should be
    supported in the NTLP, and discusses some of the resulting impacts and constraints
    on the NTLP design.</p>"
