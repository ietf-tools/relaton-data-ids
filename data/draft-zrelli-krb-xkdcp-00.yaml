abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes protocol extensions to the Kerberos protocol specification.
    The extension (hereafter called XKDCP) offers a new cross-realm protocol for Kerberos.
    The XKDCP extension defines a protocol between Kerberos Key Distribution Centers
    (KDCs) that allows a KDC to build credentials even when the client or the requested
    service is not registered in the KDC's database (but registered in another KDC's
    database). The XKDCP extension defines two protocols: XTGSP (Inter Ticket Granting
    Service Protocol) and XASP (Inter Authentication Service Protocol). The XTGSP
    protocol can be used in remote access scenarios to allow the local KDC to deliver
    credentials for services located in remote realms. On the other hand, the XASP
    protocol can be used in case of cross-realm roaming scenarios to allow the visited
    KDC to deliver credentials for roaming users.</p>"
