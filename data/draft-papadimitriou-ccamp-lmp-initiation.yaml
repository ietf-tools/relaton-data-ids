abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a companion document to Link Management Protocol (LMP),
    for which it details the Forwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) Initiation and Bundling
    process. [LMP] protocol is being developed as part of the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    protocol suite to control and manage Traffic Engineering (TE) Links. The current
    document extends the LMP capabilities to FA-LSPs enabling among other to dynamically
    configure TE Links (in particular the LSP it can serve) between non-adjacent LSRs.</p>"
