abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to use stateful hash-based signature schemes
    (SHBSS) with the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). The schemes include the Hierarchical
    Signature System (HSS) variant of Leighton-Micali Hash-Based Signatures (HSS/LMS),
    the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), and XMSS Multi-Tree (XMSS^MT). In
    addition, DNSKEY and RRSIG record formats for the signature algorithms are defined
    and new algorithm identifiers are described.</p>"
