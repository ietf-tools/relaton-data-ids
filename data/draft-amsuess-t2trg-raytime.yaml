abstract:
- content: "<p>When devices are deployed in locations with no real-time access to
    the Internet, obtaining a trusted time for validation of time limited tokens and
    certificates is sometimes not possible. This document explores the options for
    deployments in which the trade-off between availability and security needs to
    be made in favor of availability. While considerations are general, terminology
    and examples primarily focus on the ACE framework.</p>"
