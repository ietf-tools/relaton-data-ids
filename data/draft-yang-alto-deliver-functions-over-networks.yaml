abstract:
- content: "<p>As the rapid development of internet, massive data are produced. Service
    providers typically need to deploy services near the edge networks to better satisfy
    user_s demand. In order to obtain better quality of the networks, computing functions
    and user traffic need to be scheduled properly. However, it is challenging to
    efficiently schedule resources among the distributed edge servers because of the
    lack of network information, such as network topology, traffic distribution, link
    delay/bandwidth and utilization/capability of computing servers. In this standard,
    we employed the ALTO protocol to help deliver functions and schedule traffic at
    the edge computing platform. This protocol supplied information of multiple resources
    for the distributed edge computing platform, thus enhancing the efficiency of
    function delivery in edge computing platform.</p>"
