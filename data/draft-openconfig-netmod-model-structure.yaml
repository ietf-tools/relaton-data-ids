- content: "<p>This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a
    comprehensive structure that defines how individual models may be composed to
    configure and operate network infrastructure and services. The structure is itself
    represented as a YANG model rooted at a device, with all of the related component
    models logically organized in a way that is operationally intuitive.</p>"
