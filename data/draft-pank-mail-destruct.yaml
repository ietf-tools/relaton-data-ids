abstract:
- content: "<p>As e-mail use is becoming more prevalent and the applications of its
    use more diverse it is increasingly becoming a burden to users and system administration
    staff to maintain message stores and 'weed-out' obsolete messages. The problem
    also manifests itself as a direct cost to organisations trying to maintain storage
    space for user e- mail messages where a considerable proportion of messages are
    simply forgotten and lay dormant. RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol
    specifying details about US-ASCII message headers. As an extension to this protocol
    this memo proposes the introduction of an additional header to enable e-mail messages
    to 'self-destruct' after a specified period depending on a number of conditions
    that may have been specified by the originator or can subsequently be (re-)specified
    by the recipient. This memo also proposes possible client and server implementations
    with a view of soliciting feedback and further refining of the extensions.</p>"
