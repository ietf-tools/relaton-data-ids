abstract:
- content: "<p>It has become common for Internet mail users to receive and compose
    mail in the capacity of different roles or identities (for example, personal and
    work), to receive and compose mail at different machines, and to use multiple
    programs which require mail composition configuration information. These different
    roles or identities have become known as email personalities. The Application
    Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an ideal mechanism for storage of
    email personality data. This specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class
    for email personalities, and a common option for indicating a default. An SMTP
    URL scheme is also defined.</p>"
