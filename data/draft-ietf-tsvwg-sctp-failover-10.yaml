abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the major advantages of SCTP is the support of multi-homed communication.
    A multi-homed SCTP end-point has the ability to withstand network failures by
    migrating the traffic from an inactive network to an active one. However, if the
    failover operation as specified in RFC4960 is followed, there can be a significant
    delay in the migration to the active destination addresses, thus severely reducing
    the effectiveness of the SCTP failover operation. This document complements RFC4960
    by the introduction of a new path state, the Potentially Failed (PF) path state,
    and an associated new failover operation to apply during a network failure. The
    algorithm defined is called SCTP Potentially Failed Algorithm, SCTP-PF for short.
    In addition, the document complements RFC4960 by introducing alternative switchover
    operation modes for the data transfer path management after the recovery of a
    failed primary path. These modes can allow improvements in the performance of
    the operation in some network environments. The implementation of the additional
    switchover operation modes is an optional part of SCTP-PF. The procedures defined
    in the document require only minimal modifications to the current specification.
    The procedures are sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.</p>"
