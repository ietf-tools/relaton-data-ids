abstract:
- content: <p>COSE (STD96) is not an end-to-end system with guaranteed interoperability.
    It is designed to serve a range of use cases and therefore it has a lot of options.
    In general, two COSE implementations that want to interoperate require an agreement
    on which subset of COSE features they will use. This document provides a set of
    rules for specifying such agreements as "COSE profiles" and registers a new COSE
    header parameter for in-band signalling of profile information.</p>
