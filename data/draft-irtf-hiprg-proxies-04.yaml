abstract:
- content: "<p>HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from the current
    Internet architecture to the HIP architecture. A core objective of a HIP proxy
    is to facilitate the communication between legacy (or Non- HIP) hosts and HIP
    hosts while not modifying the host protocol stacks. In this document, the legacy
    hosts served by proxies are referred to as Legacy Hosts (LHs). Currently, various
    design solutions of HIP proxies have been proposed. These solutions may be applicable
    in different working circumstances. In this document, these solutions are investigated
    in detail to compare their effectiveness in different scenarios.</p>"
