abstract:
- content: "<p>Commercial grade IP telephony requires linkage between call setup,
    end-to-end QoS setup, interdomain authorization and accounting. This draft considers
    the network model for inter-domain QoS for access and transit networks, the service
    models and policy implementation options. Also, interdomain authorization and
    accounting may require the trust services of a clearinghouse, to which the local
    policy server may outsource authorization for support for inter-domain accounting.
    The draft defines two options for QoS support for telephony: PSTN- style 'QoS
    Assured' or Internet-style 'QoS Enabled' service. Implementing the local policy
    or QoS deployment can also have two options: The more usual policy 'Pull Model'
    and the policy 'Push Model' that may be advantageous for large IP telephony gateway
    deployments. The draft illustrates the various combinations of QoS service and
    policy implementation for interdomain QoS with authorization and accounting. The
    inter-process communications between the SIP, SDP, RSVP and OSP protocol engines
    is illustrated. Future work for SIP/SDP and other extensions, QoS metric and policy
    is outlined to make interdomain QoS for IP telephony possible.</p>"
