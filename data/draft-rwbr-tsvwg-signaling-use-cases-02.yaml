abstract:
- content: "<p>Host-to-network (and vice versa) signaling can improve the user experience
    by informing the network which flows are more important and which packets within
    a flow are more important without having to disclose the content of the packets
    being delivered. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g.,
    packet discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission or session
    migration), or through cooperation of both the host and the network. This document
    lists use cases demonstrating the need for a mechanism to share metadata about
    flows between a receiving host and its networks to enable differentiated traffic
    treatment for packets sent to the host. Such a mechanism is typically implemented
    using a signaling protocol between the host and a set of network elements.</p>"
