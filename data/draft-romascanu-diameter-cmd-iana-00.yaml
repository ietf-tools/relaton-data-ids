abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter Base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides a
    number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands, i.e. messages used
    by Diameter applications, and applications as the most extensive enhancements.
    RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions that lead to the need to define a new Diameter
    application or a new command code. Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension
    IETF actions are necessary. Although defining new Diameter applications does not
    require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands requires IETF consensus
    per RFC 3588. This has lead to questionable design decisions by other Standards
    Development Organizations which chose to define new applications on existing commands
    rather than asking for assignment of new command codes for the pure purpose of
    avoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF. In some cases interoperability
    problems were causes as an effect of the poor design caused by overloading existing
    commands. This document aligns the extensibility rules of Diameter application
    with the Diameter commands offering ways to delegate work on Diameter to other
    SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does not lead to poor design choices.</p>"
