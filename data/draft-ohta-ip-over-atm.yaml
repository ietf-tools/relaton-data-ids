abstract:
- content: "<p>The possibility to construct a conventional model to transfer IP over
    ATM is studied. The model contains concepts of subnet, bridges, routers, broadcast
    and so on, all of which are familiar with the model of IP over Ethernet. Still,
    the model allows QoS assured seamless internetwork level (not link level) ATM
    connection which can be directly supported by existing ATM hardware. That is,
    new communication model with resource reservation such as RSVP or STII can be
    supported efficiently.</p>"
