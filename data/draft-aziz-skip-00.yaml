abstract:
- content: "<p>There are occasions where it is advantageous to put authenticity and
    privacy features at the network layer. The vast majority of the privacy and authentication
    protocols in the literature deal with session oriented key-management schemes.
    However, many of the commonly used network layer protocols (e.g. IP and IPv6)
    are session-less datagram oriented protocols. We describe a key-management scheme
    that is particularly well suited for use in conjunction with a session-less datagram
    protocol like IP or IPv6. We also describe a simple extension of this protocol
    to provide scalable group key-management for Internet multicasting protocols.
    In this revision of the draft we describe how the basic certified key infrastructure
    proposed can be used to negotiate keys for traditional session oriented key-management.
    This provides perfect forward secrecy, for situations where forward secrecy is
    essential. We describe a particularly efficient ephemeral key-negotiation mechanism
    using the basic certified key infrastructure described above, which also addresses
    some basic privacy related concerns. SKIPP is designed to be plugged into the
    IP Security Protocol (IPSP) or IPv6. This draft describes how to use SKIPP</p>"
