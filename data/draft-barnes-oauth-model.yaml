abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the security model for the OAuth authorization
    system, which allows a party that holds some authorization to delegate a subset
    of that authorization to another party, without requiring either party to disclose
    its credentials to the other. In this document, we describe a set of design constraints,
    a high-level work flow for establishing authorizations subject to those constraints,
    and set of security requirements for protocols that implement this model.</p>"
