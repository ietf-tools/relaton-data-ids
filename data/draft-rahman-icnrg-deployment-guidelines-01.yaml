abstract:
- content: "<p>Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological
    maturity after many years of fundamental research and experimentation. This document
    provides a number of deployment considerations in the interest of helping the
    ICN community move forward to the next step of live deployments. The major deployment
    configurations for ICN are first described including the main overlay and underlay
    approaches. Then proposed deployment migration paths are outlined to address major
    practical issues such as network and application migration. Next, selected ICN
    trial experiences are summarized. Finally, protocol areas that require further
    standardization are identified to facilitate future interoperable ICN deployments.</p>"
