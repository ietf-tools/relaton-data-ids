abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for hiding customer MAC addresses
    on a PE-rs in an H-VPLS environment. In the H-VPLS hierarchy, a PE-rs is exposed
    to the MAC addresses for customers on its directly attached MTU-s and the remote
    MAC addresses for all of its configured VPLS instances. This can result in the
    requirement to store a large number of a MAC addresses. This document introduces
    the concept of an MTU-id per MTU-s which is included with the customer frame sent
    by an MTU-s. The PE-rs is then able to switch based on the MTU-id rather than
    the customer MAC addresses, thereby reducing the address storage requirements
    on the PE-rs to be of the order of the number of MTU-s.</p>"
