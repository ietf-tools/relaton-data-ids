abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a report from the IRTF Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
    research group documenting the collective experiences and lessons learned from
    studies, related experimentation, and designs completed by the research group.
    The document summarizes implications of adding HIP to host protocol stacks, Internet
    infrastructure, and applications. The perspective of a network operator, as well
    as a list of HIP experiments, are presented as well. Portions of this report may
    be relevant also to other network overlay-based architectures or to attempts to
    deploy alternative networking architectures. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
