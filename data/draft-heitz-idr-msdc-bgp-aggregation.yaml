abstract:
- content: "<p>A design for a fabric of switches to connect up to one million servers
    in a data center is described. At that scale, it is impractical for every switch
    to maintain knowledge about every other switch and every other link in the fabric.
    Aggregation of routes is an excellent way to scale such a fabric. However, aggregation
    presents some problems under link failures or switch failures. This design solves
    those problems.</p>"
