abstract:
- content: "<p>The statistical properties of packet delays for transmission across
    the Internet are investigated, based on analysis of three datasets obtained using
    CQOS cNodes, each measured over several days of continuous transmission.Two of
    these sets comprise high and low bandwidth measurement data for vectors (defined
    here as a cNode to cNode link) from CQOS headquarters to the Irvine Data Center,
    while the third is a low-bandwidth dataset obtained from a CQOS-Irvine to London
    vector.</p>"
