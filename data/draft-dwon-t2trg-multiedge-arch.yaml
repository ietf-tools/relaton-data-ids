abstract:
- content: "<p>Artificial intelligence based IoT applications demand more massive
    computing resource through networks for the process of AI tasks. To support these
    applications, some new technologies based an edge computing and fog computing
    are emerging. Especially, the computation-intensive and latency-sensitive IoT
    applications such as augmented reality, virtual reality and AI based inference
    application is deployed with an edge computing and fog computing which are connected
    with cloud computing. Recently, cluster-based edge system is deployed to extend
    computation capacity of an edge server. The cluster-based edge system has the
    advantage that can enhace the resource scalability and availability in edge computing
    and fog computing. In this draft, we present cluster-based edge system architecture
    and multi-cluster edge network topology that consists of multi-cluster edge system
    and core cloud. Also, we define the network functions and network node to configurate
    and operate multi- cluster edge network collaboratively.</p>"
