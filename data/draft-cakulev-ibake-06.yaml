abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryptographic protocols based on public-key methods have been traditionally
    based on certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to support certificate
    management. The emerging field of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) protocols allows
    simplification of infrastructure requirements via a Private-Key Generator (PKG)
    while providing the same flexibility. However, one significant limitation of IBE
    methods is that the PKG can end up being a de facto key escrow server, with undesirable
    consequences. Another observed deficiency is a lack of mutual authentication of
    communicating parties. This document specifies the Identity-Based Authenticated
    Key Exchange (IBAKE) protocol. IBAKE does not suffer from the key escrow problem
    and in addition provides mutual authentication as well as perfect forward and
    backward secrecy. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
