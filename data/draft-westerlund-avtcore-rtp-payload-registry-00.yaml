abstract:
- content: <p>It has been observed that specifications of new RTP payload formats
    often forget to register themselves in the IANA regsitry "RTP Payload Formats
    Media Types". In practice this has no real impact. One reason is that the Media
    Types registry is the crucial regsistry to register any Media Type to establish
    the media type used to identified the format in various signalling usage. To resolve
    this sitaution this document performs the following. First it updates the registry
    to include known RTP payload formats at the time of writing. Then it closes the
    IANA Registry for RTP Payload formats Media Types for future registration. Beyond
    instructing IANA to close this registry the instructions to authors in RFC 8088
    are updated that registration is no longer required in the closed registry.</p>
