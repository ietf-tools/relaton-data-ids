abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a novel architecture for providing reliable multicast transport
    service over the existing Internet protocol stack. This protocol stack ordinarily
    supports reliable unicast transport layer (TCP) connections over a network layer
    (IP) which is capable of providing an unreliable multicasting service. We propose
    the addition of a new Single Connection Emulation (SCE) sublayer between TCP and
    multicast IP. This added layer mimics the single destination network layer interface
    to TCP and interfaces with multicast IP to provide the necessary multicast functionality.
    The new architecture also enables interactions between applications and the SCE,
    thus allowing the applications to control the semantics of the reliable multicast
    connection. We discuss the design issues that need to be considered when such
    a sublayer is to be introduced. A set of specifications for implementing the SCE
    is presented. We also describe an implementation of this new approach on a BSD-based
    system.</p>"
