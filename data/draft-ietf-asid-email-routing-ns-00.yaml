abstract:
- content: "<p>Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store information
    about users and other network entities. One of the many possible uses of a directory
    service is to store information about users' email accounts, such as their email
    addresses, and how messages addressed to them should be routed. In the interest
    of interoperability, it is desirable to have a common schema for such email-related
    information. This document discusses some of the fundamental questions to be considered
    in the development of a common schema for LDAP-based routing of SMTP [3] messages,
    presents an approach that has been implemented and deployed, and discusses possible
    extensions to that approach that may serve to make it more complete and general.
    The intent is to provide information about an existing implementation, and to
    stimulate discussion about whether and how to standardize the relevant aspects
    of LDAP-based messaging management.</p>"
