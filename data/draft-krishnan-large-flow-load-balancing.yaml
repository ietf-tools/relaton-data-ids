abstract:
- content: "<p>The demands on the networking infrastructure are growing exponentially;
    the drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter data center communications
    etc. In this context, it is important to optimally use the bandwidth in the service
    provider backbone networks which extensively use LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth
    scaling. This internet draft describes the issues faced in the service provider
    backbone in the context of LAG/ECMP and formulates best practice recommendations
    for managing the bandwidth efficiently in the service provider backbone. Internet-Draft
