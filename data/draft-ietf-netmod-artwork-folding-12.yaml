abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded
    text content. One strategy, called the "single backslash" strategy, is based on
    the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding
    has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is
    not a space character (' ') on the next line. The second strategy, called the
    "double backslash" strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash
    character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle
    cases not supported by the first strategy. Both strategies use a self-describing
    header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content.</p>
