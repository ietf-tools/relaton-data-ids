abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension
    which allows endpoints to negotiate the use of encryption with forward secrecy
    at the beginning of the handshake. Two levels of functionality are defined. Implementations
    are free to support one or both levels, with the first level incurring no additional
    computational or round-trip overhead. The TLS cryptographic calculations are unchanged.</p>"
