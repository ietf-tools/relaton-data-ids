abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to satisfy the requirements in section 11.2.5
    of the Megaco/H.248 requirements document. It defines five packages: - the base
    NAS package contains properties and events supported by all NAS terminations;
    - the NAS Incoming package contains properties and events supported by NAS terminations
    involved in calls initiated by the circuit network; - the NAS Outgoing package
    contains properties supported by NAS terminations involved in calls outgoing to
    the circuit network; - the NAS Control package contains an event supported by
    a NAS Control termination, which allows the MG to indicate a request to initiate
    a data connection to a terminal served by the switched circuit network; - the
    NAS ROOT package contains properties supported by an MG which is also capable
    of supporting at least the NAS and NAS Incoming packages.</p>"
