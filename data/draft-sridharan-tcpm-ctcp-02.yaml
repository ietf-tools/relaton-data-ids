abstract:
- content: "<p>Compound TCP (CTCP) is a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism
    for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. This document describes
    the Compound TCP algorithm in detail, and solicits experimentation and feedback
    from the wider community. The key idea behind CTCP is to add a scalable delay-based
    component to the standard TCP's loss-based congestion control. The sending rate
    of CTCP is controlled by both loss and delay components. The delay-based component
    has a scalable window increasing rule that not only efficiently uses the link
    capacity, but on sensing queue build up, proactively reduces the sending rate.</p>"
