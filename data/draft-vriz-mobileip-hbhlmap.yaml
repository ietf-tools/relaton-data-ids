abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an extension to Mobile IPv6 to provide support
    for Localized Mobility Management. This proposed Hop-by-Hop Local Mobility Agents
    Probing scheme specifies the Local Mobility Agents Discovery, Selection and Failure
    Detection architecture and procedures for deploying the localized mobility management,
    whereby the Local Mobility Agents are distributed. It reduces the amount of signalling
    to the home agent and correspondent nodes when mobile node moves among the subnets
    of the visited domain</p>"
