abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a functional model for forwarding elements (FEs)
    used in the Forwarding and Control Plane Separation (ForCES) protocol. This model
    is used to describe the capabilities, capacities, state and configuration of ForCES
    forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol, so that ForCES
    control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly. The model is to specify
    what logical functions are present in the FEs, what capabilities these functions
    support, and how these functions are or can be interconnected. The forwarding
    element model defined herein is intended to satisfy the requirements specified
    in the ForCES requirements draft [FORCES-REQ]. Using this model, predefined or
    vendor specific logical functions can be expressed and configured. However, the
    definition of these individual functions are not described and defined in this
    document.</p>"
