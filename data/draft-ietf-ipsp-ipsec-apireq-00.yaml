abstract:
- content: "<p>Given the open nature of the Internet today, application protocols
    require strong security. IPsec's wire protocols appear to meet the requirements
    of many protocols. The lack of a common model for application-layer interfaces
    has complicated use of IPsec by upper- layer protocols. This document provides
    an overview of facilities which a host IPsec implementation should provide to
    applications to allow them to both observe and influence how IPsec protects their
    communications.</p>"
