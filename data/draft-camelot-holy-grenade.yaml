abstract:
- content: <p>The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140 may be usefully
    supplemented by other renowned figures of Internet and more general lore. This
    document extends the menagerie to the seminal fable of the "Holy Hand Grenade
    of Antioch", as depicted in the Monty Python film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail",
    as well as "Spamalot", the musical inspired by the movie. Spamalot The relevance
    of the musical "Spamalot" to Internet lore should be obvious to the reader; but
    in case of doubt, see also Section 1 ("What is Spam*?") of RFC2635.</p>
