abstract:
- content: "<p>According to Route-Leak Problem Definition [RFC7908], Route leaks refer
    to the case that the delivery range of route advertisements is beyond the expected
    range. For many current security protection solutions, the ISPs (Internet Service
    Providers) are focusing on finding ways to prevent the happening of BGP [RFC4271]
    route leaks. However, the real-time route leak detection if any occurs is important
    as well, and serves as the basis for leak mitigation. This document extends the
    BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] to provide a routing security scheme suitable
    for ISPs to detect BGP route leaks at the prefix level.</p>"
