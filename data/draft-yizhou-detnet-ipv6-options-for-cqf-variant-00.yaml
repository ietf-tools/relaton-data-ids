abstract:
- content: "<p>The fundamental Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) defined by Time-
    Sensitive Networking (TSN) requires no per-stream per-hop state maintenance and
    at the same time its end-to-end bounded latency and jitter can be easily computed.
    Such features are attractive and therefore CQF is being considered in wider deployments.
    To accommodate the different deployments, there are variants of CQF enhancement.
    This document introduces a new IPv6 option to include the cycle identification
    to help leverage CQF variants in DetNet network to facilitate the deployments.</p>"
