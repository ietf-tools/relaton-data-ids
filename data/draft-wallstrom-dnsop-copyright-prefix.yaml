abstract:
- content: "<p>The content of a typical zone file is lacking information on the copyright
    and license from which the content of the zone file is available. The typical
    use is to make a zone file available after an agreement on use (license) has been
    made. When the zone file is publicly available through DNS, there is no way of
    signalling the copyright ownership or any end user license of the content. This
    document describes two prefixes for handling this using the TXT RR type, _copyright
    and _license.</p>"
