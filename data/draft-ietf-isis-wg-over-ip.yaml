abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an optional implementation technique within IS-IS
    [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] used today by several ISPs for routing within their clouds.
    IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocol developed originally by OSI and
    used with IP extensions as IGP. This draft describes how to encapsulate IS-IS
    packets in IPv4 [Pos81] format. Such an encapsulation has many advantages, one
    of those being the possibility to run integrated IS-IS on anything that understands
    IPv4, including avian carriers [Wai90]. Encapsulation of IS-IS PDUs in IPv6 is
    outside the scope of this document.</p>"
