abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes three types of extensions of SOCKS Version
    5 protocol [RFC1928]. A new address type and a new command for Requests and Replies
    are introduced. These extensions supplement the insufficient generic functions
    of the SOCKSv5 protocol. These extensions enable a SOCKS server to be used as
    a translator for IPv4 and IPv6 mixed heteregenous communications with ease. In
    addition, they make each homogeneous IPv4 and IPv6 communication efficient.</p>"
