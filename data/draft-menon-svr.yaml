abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Secure Vector Routing (SVR). SVR is an overlay
    inter-networking protocol that operates at the session layer. SVR provides end-to-end
    communication of network requirements not possible or practical using network
    header layers. SVR uses application layer cookies that eliminate the need to create
    and maintain non-overlapping address spaces necessary to manage network routing
    requirements. SVR is an overlay networking protocol that works through middleboxes
    and address translators including those existing between private networks, the
    IPv4 public internet, and the IPv6 public internet. SVR enables SD-WAN and multi-cloud
    use cases and improve security at the networking routing plane. SVR eliminates
    the need for encapsulation and decapsulation often used to create non-overlapping
    address spaces.</p>"
