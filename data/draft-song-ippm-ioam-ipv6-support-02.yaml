abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been proposed to encapsulate IOAM tracing option data fields
    in IPv6 HbH options header. However, due to size of the trace data and the extension
    header location in the IPv6 packets, the proposal creates practical challenges
    for implementation, especially when other extension headers, such as a routing
    header, also exist and require in-network processing. We propose several alternative
    approaches to address this challenge, including separating the IOAM trace data
    to a different extension header, using the postcard-based telemetry (e.g., IOAM
    DEX) instead, and applying the segment IOAM trace export scheme, based on the
    network scenario and application requirements. We discuss the pros and cons of
    each approach and hope to foster standard convergence and industry adoption.</p>"
