abstract:
- content: "<p>As users' traffic faces more unpredictable attacks during transmission,
    there are more and more end-users now need high security data transmission guarantee,
    they need ISPs to provide security protection capabilities on the data forwarding
    path, but it is very difficult for operators to manage the security attributes
    of nodes through control surfaces. ISPs need to have real-time awareness of the
    security capabilities available in the network, then form a security capability
    map, finally provide security protection for users at the routing level. The goal
    of this draft is to collect the security capabilities of nodes, which will be
    one of the factors to form the routing topology, and use the routing programming
    capabilities to form a secure routing path. The security capability includes healthy
    information(such as the device software is up-to-date), security service information,
    device information(such as the manufacturer information of the equipment). The
    BGP-LS protocol is extended to carry the security capabilities of the node. The
    controller collects topology information, forms a topology path with security
    capabilities according to security requirements, and supports SRv6 path sending
    to execute node forwarding through programming.</p>"
