abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Service Orchestration Protocol (SOP) message
    flows for some important service orchestration scenarios. The flows contain complete
    packet information including both SOP and Service Description Framework (SDF)
    payloads. The message flows in this document are by no means exhaustive, but they
    carry sufficient information using which other flows can be easily constructed.
    The deployment scenarios for services are varied, and it is not possible to cover
    every possible scenario. Nevertheless, those flows will follow closely the information
    given in this document.</p>"
