abstract:
- content: "<p>TKEY [RFC2930] provides methods of setting up shared secret keys for
    TSIG [RFC2845] other than manual exchange. But TKEY itself cannot control timing
    of key renewal very well though it can add or delete shared keys. Since continuing
    to sign messages with old keys permanently is not safe, hosts which make use of
    TSIG should pay attention to the time limit of secret usage.</p>"
