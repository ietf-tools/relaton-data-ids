abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of protocols and applications that rely on
    digital certificates to authenticate either the communication channel (TLS) or
    the data itself (PKIX), the need for providing an efficient revocation system
    is paramount. Although the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) allows for
    efficient lookup of the revocation status of a certificate, the distribution of
    this information via HTTP (or very rarely) HTTPS is not particularly efficient
    for high volume websites without incurring in high distribution costs (e.g., CDN).
    In particular, this specification defines a new set of messages (i.e., OCSPv2
    Request and OCSPv2 Response) that address the inefficiencies of OCSPv1 by (a)
    providing range-based responses to optimize (reduce) the number of pre-computed
    responses required by a CA, and (b) allowing the inclusion of other (certificate
    chain) responses in the same response for round-trip and caching optimization.
    The deployment of OCSPv2 to validate the status of a certificate is meant to lower
    the costs of providing revocation services and increase the efficiency of the
    service, thus allowing for short-lived responses (i.e., hours instead of days).</p>"
