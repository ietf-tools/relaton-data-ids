abstract:
- content: '<p>Two main models for providing DSL Internet Access are currently available:
    one is based on PPP protocol and provides flexible AAA (Authentication, Authorization
    and Accounting) mechanism, dynamic IP address assignment and is generally used
    by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for temporary or semi-permanent Broadband
    connections which may be billed on a time-basis. The other is based on DHCP or
    static IP addressing, generally lacks flexible AAA mechanism and is most of the
    time associated to flat-rate broadband connections. The evolution of services
    and access techniques may quickly lead to a wide deployment of non-PPP based access
    model associated with flat rates charge, providing "always-on" Internet connections.
    However, even in this scenario, ISPs may still require that some services are
    billed on a time basis. This Internet Draft describes the problem typically faced
    by ISPs when a time-basis billing model is required for non-PPP Broadband Connections.
    It also introduces requirements that a possible solution should satisfy in order
    to address the problem. Moreover the document covers a brief analysis of the Status
    of Art.</p>'
