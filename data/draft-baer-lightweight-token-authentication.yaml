abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a specification for a token authentication mechanism
    that is sufficiently resource-friendly to use it on small embedded or mobile devices.
    The three involved parties are a service consumer (CON) a service provider (SP)
    and an authentication provider (AP). The authentication provider decouples authentication
    and the actual service that is consumed. It also serves as anonymizer. The consumer
    authenticates at the authentication provider, requests one or more authorization
    tokens and redeems those tokens when accessing the service provider's offered
    services.</p>"
