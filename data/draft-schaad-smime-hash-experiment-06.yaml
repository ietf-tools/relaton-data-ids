abstract:
- content: "<p>New hash algorithms are being developed that may include parameters.
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has not currently defined any hash algorithms
    with parameters, but anecdotal evidence suggests that defining one could cause
    major problems. This document defines just such an algorithm and describes how
    to use it so that experiments can be run to find out how bad including hash parameters
    will be. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
