abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new control. The client can use it to tell
    the server the number of responses it expects for a series of requests that were
    sent in asynchronous mode. This enables the server to better pack usually small
    LDAP result messages into send buffers that better match the TCP maximum transfer
    unit. From this a substantial improvement in network ressource utilization, response
    time and throughput is expected.</p>"
