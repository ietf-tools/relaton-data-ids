abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking IGP Route Convergence.
    The motivation and applicability for this benchmarking is provided in [1]. The
    methodology to be used for this benchmarking is described in [2]. The methodology
    and terminology to be used for benchmarking route convergence can be applied to
    any link-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4]. The data plane is measured to
    obtain the convergence benchmarking metrics. The purpose of this document is to
    introduce new terms required to complete execution of the IGP Route Convergence
    Methodology [2].</p>"
