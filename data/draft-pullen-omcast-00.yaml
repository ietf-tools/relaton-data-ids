abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines formats and procedures for middleware that operates
    at the application layer to provide for transmission of IP multicast over IP networks
    that do not have network layer multicasting enabled, by means of tunneling IP
    multicast over IP unicast. This capability is called overlay multicast (OMCAST).
    While it cannot be as efficient as network layer multicasting, OMCAST allows for
    transparent support of IP multicast applications. Because the relay agents can
    cooperate to forward multicast messages in a way modeled after network layer multicast
    trees, significant reductions in network traffic are possible as compared to parallel
    transmission by each host to all other participating hosts. However, this protocol
    only provides mechanisms for the agents to cooperate; it does not prescribe a
    mechanism for routing messages among the agents.</p>"
