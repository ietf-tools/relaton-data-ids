abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) are used to protect data exchanged over a wide range of application protocols,
    and can also form the basis for secure transport protocols. Over the years, the
    industry has witnessed several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks
    on the most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document
    provides the latest recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services
    that use TLS and DTLS. These recommendations are applicable to the majority of
    use cases. An earlier version of this document was published as RFC 7525 when
    the industry was in the midst of its transition to TLS 1.2. Years later this transition
    is largely complete and TLS 1.3 is widely available. This document updates the
    guidance given the new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, the document
    updates RFC 5288 and RFC 6066 in view of recent attacks.</p>"
