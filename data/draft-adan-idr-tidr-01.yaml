abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we propose a new hierarchical method to enhance the current
    routing and forwarding paradigm for the Internet called Tunneled Inter-Domain
    Routing (TIDR). We will present the way in which TIDR permits to establish tunnels
    to the edge of the network, and how they will be used to forward traffic to stub
    networks. These tunnels will be explicitly signaled by using a new transitive
    BGP attribute called LOCATOR. This new routing and forwarding paradigm provides,
    among others, the following benefits: global routing table reduction, inter-domain
    routing infrastructure protection, improved multi-homing of edge networks, numerous
    forwarding decisions for a particular address prefix, it stops the AS number consumption,
    and it can be smoothly deployed.</p>"
