abstract:
- content: "<p>Rings are the most common topology in access and aggregation networks.
    However, the use of MPLS as the transport protocol for rings is very limited today.
    draft-ietf-mpls-rmr-02 describes a mechanism to handle rings efficiently using
    MPLS. This document describes the extensions to the RSVP protocol for signaling
    MPLS label switched paths in rings.</p>"
