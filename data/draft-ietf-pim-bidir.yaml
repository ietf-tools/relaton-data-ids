abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of
    PIM Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources
    and receivers. Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder
    (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology. With the
    assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the
    Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring
    source-specific state. The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides
    the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol
    events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
