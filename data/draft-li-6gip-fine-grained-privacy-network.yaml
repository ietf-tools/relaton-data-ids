abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes some potential new privacy requirements for the
    future network. We start from the data lifecycle and propose that the privacy
    needs to be considered during the data is processing. We also introduce some new
    academic research results. Some use cases are proposed. The goal is to attract
    IETF working or interest groups in researching to these new requirements in protocol
    level for the future network.</p>"
