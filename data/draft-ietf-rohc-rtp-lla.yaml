abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile for
    compression of IP/UDP/RTP (Internet Protocol/User Datagram Protocol/Real-Time
    Transport Protocol) packets, utilizing functionality provided by the lower layers
    to increase compression efficiency by completely eliminating the header for most
    packets during optimal operation. The profile is built as an extension to the
    ROHC RTP profile. It defines additional mechanisms needed in ROHC, states requirements
    on the assisting layer to guarantee transparency, and specifies general logic
    for compression and decompression making use of this header-free packet. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
