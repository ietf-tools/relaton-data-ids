abstract:
- content: <p>This document is intended to seed discussion about the Extensible Supply-chain
    Discovery Service (ESDS), an application layer protocol for the distributed sharing
    and discovery of notification events between associated partners within a supply
    chain. Specified initially as a web service interface, the protocol defines event
    tracking and tracing operations as well as core object management operations.
    This document obsoletes "Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service Concepts draft-young-esds-concepts-03".
    Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at esds@ietf.org
