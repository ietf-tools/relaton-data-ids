abstract:
- content: "<p>To support the utility of Brand Indicators for Message Identification
    (BIMI), domains publishing BIMI records may find it useful to know when their
    logos are failing to be displayed as expected. When an entity, for example a mailbox
    operator, determines whether or not to display the logo identified in the BIMI
    record, they may encounter errors trying to retrieve the image file. Similarly,
    the associated evidence document used to validate the logo may fail evaluation.
    In other cases, the evaluator may decide that despite everything validating, they
    may rely on local policies that determine validated logos should still not be
    displayed. This specification defines how BIMI evaluators should report their
    evaluation outcome back to the publisher within the context of existing Domain-based
    Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) reports.</p>"
