abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an echo function for the connection-less network
    layer protocol. Two mechanisms are introduced that may be used to implement the
    echo function. The first mechanism is recommended as an interim solution for the
    Internet community. The second mechanism will be progressed to the ANSI X3S3.3
    working group for consideration as a work item. When an ISO standard is adopted
    that provides functionality similar to that described by this memo, then this
    memo will become obsolete and superceded by the ISO standard. This memo is not
    intended to compete with an ISO standard. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
