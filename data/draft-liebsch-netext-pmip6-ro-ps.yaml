abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is the IETF standard for network-based localized
    mobility management. In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are topologically anchored
    at a Local Mobility Anchor, which forwards all data for registered mobile nodes.
    The set up and maintenance of localized routing, which allows forwarding of data
    packets between mobile nodes and correspondent nodes directly without involvement
    of the Local Mobility Anchor in forwarding, is not considered. This document describes
    the problem space of localized routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6.</p>"
