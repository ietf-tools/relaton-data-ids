abstract:
- content: <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario where traffic is tunneled between
    edge routers. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1, PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix
    P/m via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm. If the edge router PEi crashes
    or becomes totally disconnected from the core, it desirable for a core router
    "P" that is carrying traffic to the failed edge router PEi to immediately restore
    traffic by re- routing packets originally tunneled to PEi and destined to the
    prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers that advertised P/m, say PEj, until
    BGP re-converges. If the packets originally flowing to the failed edge router
    PEi are labeled, then the repairing core router P router must swap the label advertised
    by the failed edge router PEi for the prefix P/m with the label advertised for
    the same prefix by the edge router PEj before re-routing the packet through an
    LSP terminating PEj. The document proposes an extension to IS-IS protocol to inform
    core routers about the repair edge router PEj and, for labeled packets, the label
    that needs to be pushed/swapped before sending the packet into the tunnel terminating
    on PEj</p>
