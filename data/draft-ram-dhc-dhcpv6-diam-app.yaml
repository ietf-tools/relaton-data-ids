abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) authentication,
    as described in RFC3315, makes use of a model described in RFC3118. The DHCP threat
    model is described in RFC3118. But RFC3315 does not discuss the dynamic establishment
    of the security association between client and the DHCPv6 server. Also it assumes
    that the establishment of the security association is done out of band. This draft
    proposes to make use of the security association between DHCPv6 client and the
    home authentication, authorization and accounting (AAAH) to establish the security
    association dynamically and in band. This draft defines an AAA interface between
    DHCPv6 server and AAAH which enables the authentication of the DHCPv6 client with
    AAAH.</p>"
