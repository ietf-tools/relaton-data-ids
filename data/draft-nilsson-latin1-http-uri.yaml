abstract:
- content: "<p>The recent gain of internet users in non-US countries has increased
    the demand for 8 bit characters in URIs. The lack of recommended character map
    has lead to several incompatible implementations. This document suggests the use
    of ISO-8859-1 to represent all the characters present in that character table.</p>"
