abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a Push Notification Gateway (PNG) network
    element can be used to allow SIP User Agents (UA) to run on devices where background
    processing and monitoring is limited. In these circumstances, it cannot be assumed
    that the SIP UA can regularly REGISTER with the network or be able to detect inbound
    messages. A PNG stores details provided to it by the UA during registration to
    prompt a Push Notification Service (PNS) to generate a real-time notification
    for the UA to REGISTER with the network and therefore be available for inbound
    SIP messages.</p>"
