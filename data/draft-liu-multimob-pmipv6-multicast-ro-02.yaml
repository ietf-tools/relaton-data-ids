abstract:
- content: "<p>To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, MULTIMOB WG has issued
    several proposals including the base solution, dedicated schemes and direct routing
    which requires all communications to go through the local mobility anchor(LMA),
    the dedicated server and the native multicasting infrastructure, respectively.
    As this can be suboptimal, this document describes multicast routes optimazition
    mechanisms for multicast sender. Multicast sender attached to the same or different
    mobile access gateways(MAG) with multicast listener sends multicast data via the
    tunnel between the gateways without any dedicated devices or dependence of the
    native multicasting infrastructure. The MAG and the LMA are the mobility entities
    defined in the PMIPv6 protocol and act as PIM-SM routers.</p>"
