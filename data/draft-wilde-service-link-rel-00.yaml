abstract:
- content: <p>Many resources provided on the Web are part of a sets of resources that
    are provided in a context that is defined and managed by one particular service
    provider. Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or
    "Web APIs". This specification defines two link relations that allow to represent
    relationships from those resources to ones that provide documentation or descriptions
    of the Web services. The difference between these concepts is that documentation
    is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily
    intended for automated consumers.</p>
