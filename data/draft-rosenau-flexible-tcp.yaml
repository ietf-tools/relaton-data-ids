abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol that may be used as replacement
    for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The protocol allows changing the
    lower-layer address (such as IP address) or even a change or the lower-layer protocol
    (e.g. from IPv4 to IPv6) in the middle of the connection. Use cases are private
    peer-to-peer applications (such as computer games) or mobile communication.</p>"
