abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file
    transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host.
    One of its primary uses is the booting of diskless nodes on a Local Area Network.
    TFTP is used because it is very simple to implement in a small node's limited
    ROM space. However, the choice of a lock-step schema is not the most efficient
    for use on a LAN. This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client
    and server to negotiate a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send as an alternative
    for replacing the lock-step single block schema. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism
    is described in [2].</p>"
