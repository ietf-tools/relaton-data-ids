abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extensions
    for use with RADIUS/TLS and RADIUS/DTLS. These extensions permit the negotiation
    of an additional application protocol for RADIUS over (D)TLS. No changes are made
    to RADIUS/UDP or RADIUS/TCP. The extensions allow the negotiation of a transport
    profile where the RADIUS shared secret is no longer used, and all MD5-based packet
    signing and attribute obfuscation methods are removed. When this extension is
    used, the previous Authenticator field is repurposed to contain an explicit request
    / response identifier, called a Token. The Token also allows more than 256 packets
    to be outstanding on one connection. This extension can be seen as a transport
    profile for RADIUS, as it is not an entirely new protocol. It uses the existing
    RADIUS packet layout and attribute format without change. As such, it can carry
    all present and future RADIUS attributes. Implementation of this extension requires
    only minor changes to the protocol encoder and decoder functionality. The protocol
    defined by this extension is named "RADIUS version 1.1", or "radius/1.1".</p>
