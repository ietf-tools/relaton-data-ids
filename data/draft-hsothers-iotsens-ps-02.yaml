abstract:
- content: "<p>The document attempts to establish the need for new authentication
    methods in the Internet of Things (IoT) as a future networking area beyond 5G
    going into 6G for standardization. Several scenarios are described where the current
    authentication protocols do not work or are insufficient. Wireless LAN/6G sensing
    is established as an admission method that can be used within the framework of
    Device Provisioning Protocol and LED light and others as out-of band channel based
    authentication which can be further explored.</p>"
