abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Binary Low-Overhead Block (BLOB) protocol for
    on-the-wire presentation of data in the context of higher-level protocols. BLOB
    is designed to encode and decode data with low overhead on most CPUs, to be reasonably
    space-efficient, and for its representation to be sufficiently precise that it
    is suitable as a canonical format for digital signatures</p>"
