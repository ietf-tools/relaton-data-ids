abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a marking scheme for tagging low-latency flows
    (for example: interactive voice and video, gaming, machine to machine applications)
    that is safe to use by the mobile network for matching such flows to suitable
    per-hop behaviors (EPS bearers defined by 3GPP) in its core and radio segments.
    The suggested scheme re-uses NQB, a DiffServ-based signalling scheme with compatible
    rate-delay trade-off semantics that has been recently introduced in the context
    of fixed access to allow differential treatment of non-queue building vs queue
    building flows.</p>"
