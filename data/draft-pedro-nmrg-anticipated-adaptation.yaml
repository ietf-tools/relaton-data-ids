abstract:
- content: "<p>The adoption of SDN/NFV technologies by current computer and network
    system infrastructures is constantly increasing, becoming essential for the the
    particular case of edge/branch network systems. The systems supported by these
    infrastructures require to be adapted to environment changes within a short period
    of time. Thus, the complexity of new systems and the speed at which management
    and control operations must be performed go beyond human limits. Thus, management
    systems must be automated. However, in several situations current automation techniques
    are not enough to respond to requirement changes. Here we propose to anticipate
    changes in the operation environments of SDN/NFV systems in response to external
    events and reflect it in the anticipation of the amount of resources required
    by those systems for their ulterior adaptaion. The final objective is to avoid
    service degradation or disruption while keeping close-to-optimum resource allocation
    to reduce monetary and operative cost as much as possible. Here we discuss how
    to achieve such capabilities by the integration of the Autonomic Resource Control
    Architecture (ARCA) to the management and operation (MANO) of NFV systems. We
    showcase it by building a multi-domain SDN/NFV infrastructure based on OpenStack
    and deploying ARCA to adapt a virtual system based on the edge/branch network
    concept to the operational conditions of an emergency support service, which is
    rarely used but that cannot leave any user unattended.</p>"
