abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a fully-qualified domain name in the Domain
    Name System (DNS) that can be relied upon never to exist. The availability of
    a name in the DNS which is guaranteed not to exist has useful operational applications.
    This document also provides a procedural framework for other names that have special
    characteristics to be reserved, and for those special characteristics to be codified
    as modifications to the normal ARPA administration process.</p>"
