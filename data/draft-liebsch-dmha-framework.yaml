abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses and describes an architecture and protocol
    framework for the design and specification of a generic IP based architecture
    and protocol for Dormant Mode Host Alerting, aka IP paging. It focuses on the
    location and operation related interworking of the different functional entities
    as required to allow for a flexible and scalable deployment of the protocol. Furthermore,
    protocol transport and security mechanisms are evaluated and proposed to meet
    respective requirements on a DMHA protocol. This document intends to be a comprehensive
    guideline for the design of a generic IP paging architecture and protocol.</p>"
