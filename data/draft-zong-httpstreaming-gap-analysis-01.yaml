abstract:
- content: "<p>With the explosive growth of the Internet usage and increasing demand
    for multimedia information on the web, media delivery over Internet attract substantial
    attention from media industry. To meet above requirements, HTTP Streaming technology
    is designed and gradually plays an important role in recent years. Several leading
    Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) have been producing a series of technical
    specifications to define streaming over HTTP. Moreover, several companies have
    devoted to developing private HTTP-based media delivery platform to provide high
    quality, adaptive viewing experience to customers. Following a brief survey of
    existing HTTP streaming standards and implementations, this document gives a brief
    summary on these related work, analyzes the potential challenges especially from
    the network point of view, and lists the gap between existing work and possible
    working scope on the topic of HTTP streaming in IETF.</p>"
