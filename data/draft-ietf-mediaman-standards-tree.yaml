abstract:
- content: "<p>Over time, it has become clear that there are media types which have
    the character of belonging in the standards tree (because they are not associated
    with any one vendor or person), but are not published by a standards body. This
    draft suggests an update to [RFC6838] to allow their registration.</p>"
