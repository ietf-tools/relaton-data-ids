abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent starts up, it registers
    to the network and initiates numerous subscriptions in order to learn about various
    network events. This results in a chatty startup procedure which substantially
    impacts recovery times under avalanche restart. This specification proposes a
    mechanism whereby the subscriptions can be established as a side effect of the
    registration, alleviating this problem.</p>"
