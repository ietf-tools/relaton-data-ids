abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite the growing availability of good measurement platforms, it
    is still impossible to generalize IPPM metrics measurement among heterogeneous
    points of measure. To do so, the extra information inserted in the IP packets
    to perform the measurement has to be standardized. This document defines an IPPM
    measurement signature suitable for performing the measure of the current IPPM
    metrics, for integrating those used by manufacturers and for allowing the IPPM
    WG to define other measurement signature in the future.</p>"
