abstract:
- content: <p>Ultra-Low Latency is a highly desired property for many types of services,
    such as 5G MTC (Machine Type Communication) requiring E2E connection for V2V to
    be less than 2ms, AR/VR requiring delay less than 5ms, V2X less than 20ms, etc.
    This draft examines the E2E latency from architectural perspective, from studying
    how different OSI layers contribute to E2E latency, how different domains, which
    can be different operators' domains or administrative domains, contribute to E2E
    latency, to analyzing the gaps of recent technology advancement in reducing latency.
    By studying the contributing factors to E2E latency from various angles, the draft
    identifies some gaps of recent technology advancement for E2E services traversing
    multiple domains and involving multiple layers, which can be the basis for IAB
    to organize more in-depth discussion, like workshop or cross Area (or industry
    wide) BOF, as the scope of the discussion will be too wide for one IETF WG. The
    discussion might touch upon multiple IETF areas. The goal of those further "deep-dive"
    workshop or cross area BOF is to establish more comprehensive foundation to IESG
    and the IETF community in identifying potential new work initiatives for reducing
    E2E latency of services over the Internet.</p>
