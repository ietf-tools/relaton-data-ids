abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides an interoperable specification for Merkle tree
    ladder (MTL) mode, a technique for using an underlying signature scheme to authenticate
    an evolving series of messages. MTL mode can reduce the signature scheme's operational
    impact. Rather than signing messages individually, the MTL mode of operation signs
    structures called "Merkle tree ladders" that are derived from the messages to
    be authenticated. Individual messages are then authenticated relative to the ladder
    using a Merkle tree authentication path and the ladder is authenticated using
    the public key of the underlying signature scheme. The size and computational
    cost of the underlying signatures are thereby amortized across multiple messages,
    reducing the scheme's operational impact. The reduction can be particularly beneficial
    when MTL mode is applied to a post-quantum signature scheme that has a large signature
    size or computational cost. As an example, the document shows how to use MTL mode
    with SPHINCS+ (and the SLH-DSA subset specified in the draft FIPS 205), the stateless
    hash-based signature scheme selected by NIST for standardization. Like other Merkle
    tree techniques, MTL mode's security is based only on cryptographic hash functions,
    so the mode is quantum-safe based on the quantum-resistance of its cryptographic
    hash functions.</p>
