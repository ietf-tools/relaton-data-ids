abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational draft describes the DPAC (Data Packet Access Control)
    framework, potentially under PANA, to efficiently control 'data packets' to access
    the network. Instead of using potentially more expensive crypto-based mechanisms
    such as IPSec (layer 3) or IEEE 802.11i (layer 2), DPAC introduces the possibility
    of using and negotiating a range of light-weight per-data-packet source authentication
    methods to control the data packets from PANA Clients (PaC). In DPAC, each data
    packet sent from PaCs to Enhanced Point (EP) can be classified, with high probability,
    as either valid or invalid. Furthermore, under this framework, it is possible
    for EP and PAA to account reliably on the network usage of each PaC.</p>"
