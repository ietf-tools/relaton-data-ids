abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes several new SDP "proto" and "attribute-name"
    attribute values in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" IANA registry
    that can be used to describe QUIC transport for RTP and RTCP packets, and describes
    how SDP Offer/Answer can be used to set up an RTP connection using QUIC as a transport
    protocol. These new values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an underlying
    transport protocol for RTP applications that commonly use SDP as a session signaling
    protocol to set up RTP connections, such as SIP and WebRTC. This document also
    contains non-normative guidance for implementers.</p>
