abstract:
- content: "<p>As noted in Roaming Requirements, there is a need for end-to-end secu-
    rity in roaming, including end-to-end integrity protection, and confi- dentiality.
    In roaming implementations based on proxy chaining, pack- ets are routed between
    the NAS and home server through a series of proxies. Current roaming implementations
    provide only hop-by-hop security, guarding only against modification of packets
    in transit between hops. This makes it possible for untrusted proxies to modify
    packets sent between a NAS and a home server without detection, as well as to
    decrypt PAP passwords, Tunnel passwords, and other hidden attributes which are
    available to it in cleartext. This document provides a framework for end-to-end
    security in roaming, making it possible to provide end-to-end message integrity
    and attribute hiding through addition of three new attributes.</p>"
