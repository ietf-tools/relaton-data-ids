abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN and PBB-EVPN introduce a family of solutions for multipoint Ethernet
    services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced features among which their multi-homing
    capabilities. These solutions introduce Single-Active and All-Active for an Ethernet
    Segment (ES), itself defined as a set of physical links between the multi-homed
    device/network and a set of PE devices that they are connected to. This document
    extends the Ethernet Segment concept so that an ES can be associated to a set
    of EVCs (e.g., VLANs) or other objects such as MPLS Label Switch Paths (LSPs)
    or Pseudowires (PWs), referred to as Virtual Ethernet Segments (vES). This draft
    describes the requirements and the extensions needed to support vES in EVPN and
    PBB-EVPN.</p>"
