abstract:
- content: "<p>Server-to-server event pipelines are required in situations where an
    event source generates events for a number of end-users (or simply generates events
    without an idea of who the end recipients might be), and sends these events to
    an event or notification aggregator service. These kinds of event source servers
    are common in messaging (for example, voice messaging servers and calendar servers
    might send events to a user's main messaging server or to a single-purpose notification
    server). A general set of requirements is outlined here for the server-to-server
    aspect of these kinds of scenarios.</p>"
