abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6 enables
    mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without
    changing the IP address. PMIPv6 also provides limited multi-homing support to
    multi-mode mobile devices. While the basic scenario addressed by PMIPv6 considers
    MNs with just one interface, PMIPv6 also allows an MN to connect to the same PMIPv6
    domain through different interfaces. This limited support of multi- interfaced
    MNs is not fully specified, since the MAG needs to obtain/ guess additional information
    from the MN, in order to decide whether to treat an MN's interface attachment
    as a handover or as new interface attachment (i.e. meaning the creation of a new
    mobility session and, therefore, the allocation of new home network prefixes to
    the MN). The use of the Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services as defined in
    the IEEE 802.21-2008 specification [IEEE80221] may help in obtaining this additional
    information. This I-D describes how PMIPv6 would work in an 802.21-enabled scenario,
    and in particular, analyzes how MIH primitives can be used to help the MAG deal
    with multi-technology scenarios. The main objective of the IEEE 802.21- 2008 standard
    is to provide link layer intelligence to upper layers. Hence, a more intelligent
    decision making capability leading to more reliable and efficient handovers between
    heterogeneous networks can be enabled.</p>"
