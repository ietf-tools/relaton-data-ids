abstract:
- content: "<p>In general, BGP autonomous system (AS) relationships are either customer-transit
    or peer-peer. If an AS sends a route received from a transit or a peer to another
    transit or to another peer, it is considered a route leak. AS relationships are
    sometimes different for different routes or in different regions. A method of
    detecting route leaks is proposed that does not require participation by the leaking
    AS or by IXPs. Only the ASes that perform leak detection need to adopt the proposal.
    ASes that request leak protection need to send a community to make the request.
    The proposal works even if the leaking AS or other ASes modify or discard path
    attributes in the route or create more specific routes.</p>"
