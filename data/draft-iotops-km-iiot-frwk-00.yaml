abstract:
- content: "<p>Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet protocols
    supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections. The integration between
    traditional information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) so far
    has centered around collection of real-time data from devices in OT environment
    for consumption within the enterprise IT networks. However, improvements in process
    control and automation require a far better interworking between the OT and IT
    applications. This document provides a reference framework for integrated industry
    networks (IIN). It highlights interfaces and their characteristics required for
    interconnecting components of OT and IT that maybe moved to the cloud or edges.
    It suggests the use of IIN to bridge the differences between OT and IETF technologies.</p>"
