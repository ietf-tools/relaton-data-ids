abstract:
- content: "<p>Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is widely deployed today for discovery
    of information across network elements like routers, switches, and hosts. This
    document extends LLDP to allow hosts to advertise their IP prefixes to their attached
    routers which can then propagate the reachability of these host prefixes into
    routing protocols for enabling network-wide connectivity.</p>"
