abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Cloud Mesh is a server federation protocol that is used to notify
    a Receiving Party that they have been granted access to some Resource. It has
    similarities with authorization flows such as OAuth, as well as with social internet
    protocols such as ActivityPub and email. Open Cloud Mesh only handles the necessary
    interactions up to the point where the Receiving Party is informed that they were
    granted access to the Resource. The actual resource access is then left to protocols
    such as WebDAV and others.</p>"
