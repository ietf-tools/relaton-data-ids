abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution framework for IP Multicast VPNs.
    It describes procedures for establishing optimal virtual private IP multicast
    networks over a provider network. The simple multicast tunnel operation mechanism
    within a core network provides easy and flexible IP multicast VPN service operation
    for the service provider. And because the solution can minimize PIM neighbor maintenance
    over remote PEs, the solution enhances the scalability performance of the multicast
    VPN service network. This document also describes a P2MP TE LSP based multicast
    tunnel mechanism which could enhance TE capability and reliability of IP multicast
    VPNs.</p>"
