abstract:
- content: "<p>The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is standardized in ISO-3779
    and ISO-3780. The VIN is made of 17 alphanumeric characters code that uniquely
    identifies a vehicle worldwide. Some public information related to a vehicle can
    be obtained knowing its VIN code. This code may also be used to enable novel vehicular
    networking communications. RFC 4193 introduces a globally unique IPv6 unicast
    address format intended for local communications, usually inside of a site. These
    addresses (ULA) are not expected to be routable on the global Internet. This document
    introduces a method to build a VIN-based IPv6 Prefix that is intended for local
    communications involving more than one hop (VULA). The VIN-based generated prefix
    is assured to be unique among other VIN-based generated prefixes. Typically, in
    a scenario involving several vehicles, each single vehicle (in which one Mobile
    Router is in charge) is capable of generating its own unique infrastructure-independent
    globally-scoped VIN-based IPv6 prefix. This document also describes some use cases
    where VULA could be exploited.</p>"
