abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a solution for extended network mobility support,
    that is a mechanism to enable optimal routing between mobile network nodes and
    its correspondent nodes. The proposed scheme not only provides optimal routing
    for the mobility aware nodes but also maintains the benefits of mobility transparency.
    Our solution achieves route optimization by expecting the Mobile Router to take
    the role of an Access Router thereby reducing the number of external signaling
    messages a node behind the Mobile Router needs to perform. In order to further
    reduce the number of signaling messages beyond the scope of the mobile network
    we further propose the Mobile Router to play the role of an Home Agent for NEMO-enabled
    nodes.</p>"
