abstract:
- content: "<p>Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use by performing
    computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment. Especially in virtualization
    environments, confidential computing could protect data and applications from
    access or tampering by hypervisor or other privileged users. In Computing-Aware
    network, computing resource is an essential element to provide computing services
    for network users' applications. Introducing confidential computing in Computing-Aware
    network could mitigate the distrust of computing resource efficiently. This document
    provides the architecture of confidential computing in Computing-Aware network
    management plane to provide confidentiality and integrity for applications.</p>"
