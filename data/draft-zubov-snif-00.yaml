abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution, referred as SNIF, that provides
    the means for any Internet connected device to: * allocate a globally unique anonymous
    hostname * obtain and maintain a publicly trusted X.509 certificate [RFC5280]
    issued for the allocated hostname * accept incoming TLS connections on specific
    TCP ports of the allocated hostname from any TLS clients that are capable of sending
    Server Name Indication [RFC6066] The private key associated with the X.509 certificate
    is securely stored on the TLS terminating device, and is never exposed to any
    other party at any step of the process. About This Document This note is to be
    removed before publishing as an RFC. Status information for this document may
    be found at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zubov-snif-00. Information
    can be found at https://snif.host. Source for this draft and an issue tracker
