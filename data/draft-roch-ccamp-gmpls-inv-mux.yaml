abstract:
- content: "<p>A set of requirements and a proposed implementation for the control
    of the SONET/SDH inverse multiplexing capabilities known as VCAT/LCAS is given
    in [CCAMP-VCAT]. However, implementations based on OIF implementation agreements
    and their prototype extensions have identified gaps in [CCAMP-VCAT]. This draft
    proposes a wider scoped alternative implementation approach that addresses the
    requirements of [CCAMP-VCAT] and additional requirements of independent setup
    of the VCAT group and its members.</p>"
