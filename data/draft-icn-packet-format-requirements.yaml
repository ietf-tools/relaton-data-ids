abstract:
- content: "<p>It is a great challenge to design the right packet format for the Information-Centric
    Networking (ICN), because this new architecture is still in its research stage.
    We do not have good prediction regarding either the technology advances or the
    application needs may involve in next 10 years and beyond. To minimize the danger
    of premature constraints in the packet format design, we believe it is important
    to first clearly identify the design requirements, so that we can use the requirements
    to guide the design effort. In this document we describe our understanding of
    the design requirements and their tradeoffs.</p>"
