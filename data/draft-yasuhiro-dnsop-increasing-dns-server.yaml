abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, it is thought that the maximum number of DNS servers for
    a zone is 13. In fact, current root and some TLD zones have 13 DNS servers. But
    this is not enough for DNS stability and robustness especially root and/or TLD
    server, therefore, IP anycast [Hardie, 2002] is introduced on some root servers.
    This draft proposes an another approach for increasing of DNS server hosts without
    changing DNS protocol by using 'multiple-addresses per host' method. And this
    draft also considers what is the most suitable number of the IP addresses for
    one DNS server name.</p>"
