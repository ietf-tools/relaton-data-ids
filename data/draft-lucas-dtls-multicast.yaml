abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal to provide a secure multicast 1-to-N or M-to-N device
    capability, with the same level of reliability as the underlying multicast network,
    also aims to be light-weight and supported by a very constrained device. Guaranteed
    reliability would be provided by an additional protocol working in co-operation
    with it. The aim is to support end to end secure communications in the edge device
    world of IoT where the transport methods will vary or at least change once the
    IP realm is left. Hence there is no dependence on Ipv6 or IP or CoAP and no restrictions
    that might be introduced if too specific an end node application was implied.
    It is network independent, it just must be possible to transmit and receive frames
    in multicast. This can be achieved with simply a minimal change to the DTLS behavior
    and using current DTLS libraries. DTLS headers are not changed, additional headers
    are used in the packets before the DTLS traffic. DTLS Multicast keeps the layer
    concept pure and independent, hence it can be used for routing something that
    is not CoAP.</p>"
