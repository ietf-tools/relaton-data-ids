abstract:
- content: "<p>The RDMA transport for ONC RPC supports direct data placement for NFS
    data. Direct data placement not only reduces the amount of data that needs to
    be copied in an NFS call, but allows much of the data movement over the network
    to be implemented in RDMA hardware. This draft describes the use of direct data
    placement by means of server- initiated RDMA Writes into client-supplied buffers
    in a Write list for implementations of NFS versions 2, 3, and 4 over an RDMA transport.</p>"
