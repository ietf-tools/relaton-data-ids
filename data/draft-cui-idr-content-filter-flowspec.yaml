abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Flow Specification enables the distribution of traffic filter
    policies (traffic filters and actions) via BGP, facilitating DDoS traffic filtering.
    However, the traffic filter in FSv1 and FSv2 predominantly focuses on IP header
    fields, which may not adequately address volumetric DDoS attack traffic characterized
    by fixed patterns within the packet content. This document introduces a new flow
    specification filter type designed for packet content filtering. The match field
    includes ptype, otype, offset, content-length, content, and mask encoded in the
    Flowspec NLRI. This new filter aims to leverage network devices such as routers
    and switches to defend against simple volumetric DDoS attacks, reducing the overall
    defence cost of carrier network.</p>"
