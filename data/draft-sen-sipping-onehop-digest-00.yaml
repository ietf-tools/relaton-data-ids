abstract:
- content: "<p>To date, the HTTP access authentication framework, as described in
    [RFC2617] and as used in [SIPbis05], has permitted limited SIP message authentication
    from UAC to Proxy/UAS, Proxy to Proxy, and Proxy to UAS. This draft addresses
    some of the shortcomings of SIP usage of Digest for message authentication between
    a SIP User Agent and a Proxy one hop away (e.g., an outbound Proxy). For the messages
    exchanged between the UA and a Proxy one hop away, the Service Provider may want
    to provide a different level of protection than that possible for the same messages
    end-to-end.</p>"
