abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency
    for critical flows. This document defines how to leverage Segment Routing (SR)
    to implement bounded latency. Specifically, the SR Identifier (SID) is used to
    specify transmission time (cycles) of a packet. When forwarding devices along
    the path follow the instructions carried in the packet, the bounded latency is
    achieved. This is called Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF) in this
    document. Since SR is a source routing technology, no per-flow state is maintained
    at intermediate and egress nodes, SR-based CSQF naturally supports flow aggregation
    that is deemed to be a key capability to allow DetNet to scale to large networks.</p>"
