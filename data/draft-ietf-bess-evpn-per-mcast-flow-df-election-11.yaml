abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an enhancement to the Designated Forwarder (DF)
    election process in Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) environments. While
    traditional DF election operates at a per Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) or
    per group of VLANs (in case of VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle service) level,
    such granularity may not be sufficient for applications requiring optimized or
    isolated multicast forwarding. This specification introduces a refined DF election
    mechanism that extends existing hash-based methods to operate at a more granular
    level specifically at the tuple of Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI), VLAN, and
    multicast flow. This approach enables improved traffic distribution, enhanced
    load balancing, and greater deployment flexibility for multicast delivery in EVPN
    based networks. The proposed method is designed to remain compatible with existing
    DF election procedures while offering targeted improvements for multicast scenarios.</p>"
