abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a method of using DNS to determine the network
    that contains a specified IP address, the netmask of that network, and the address(es)
    of first-hop routers(s) on that network. This method supports variable-length
    subnet masks, delegation of subnets on non-octet boundaries, and multiple routers
    per subnet. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
