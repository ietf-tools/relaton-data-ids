abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP was designed to be an extremely lightweight stateless protocol
    based on TCP. However actual implementation experience suggests that the overhead
    inherent in establishing a separate TCP connection for every request represents
    a significant performance problem. This proposal suggests an optional facility
    for HTTP version 1.1 which allows a client to create persistent connections with
    a server. This facility is also designed to work with proxy servers.</p>"
