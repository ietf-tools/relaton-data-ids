abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 unicast addressing format includes a separation between the
    prefix used to route packets to a subnet and the interface identifier used to
    specify a given interface connected to that subnet. Currently, the interface identifier
    is defined as 64 bits long for almost every case, leaving 64 bits for the subnet
    prefix. This document describes the advantages of this fixed boundary and analyzes
    the issues that would be involved in treating it as a variable boundary.</p>"
