abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a solution for Basic Network Support. It proposes
    Mobile IPv6 extensions as advocated by the NEMO working group. Our solution differs
    from Prefix Scope Binding Update (PSBU) which was originally proposed before the
    NEMO working group was set up. Our draft however uses mechanisms similar to those
    of PSBU, such as 'Prefix binding' and 'Searching mechanism of prefix binding'.
    The main difference relies on the management of the permanent address of the MR,
    which is assigned to the ingress interface, and not to the egress interface.</p>"
