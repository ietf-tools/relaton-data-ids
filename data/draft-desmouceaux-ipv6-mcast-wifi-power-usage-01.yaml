abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 networks make a consequent use of multicast for several purposes,
    including mandatory functions such as Neighbor Discovery. Although this use of
    multicast does not create real difficulties on wired networks, it can become painful
    on wireless ones, notably in terms of power consumption. There might be little
    effect on home networks, however, such effects become more important on large-scale
    networks. This memo provides statistics about the multicast traffic rate in a
    large IPv6 wireless network and the induced device power consumption, in response
    to a call emitted at IETF 89.</p>"
