abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines use cases and requirements for the exchange
    of VCONs (Virtual Conversation) within contact centers. A VCON is a standardized
    format for the exchange of call recordings and call metadata. Today, call recordings
    are exchanged between different systems within the contact center. Often, these
    are done using proprietary file formats and proprietary APIs. By using VCONs,
    integration complexity can be reduced.</p>"
