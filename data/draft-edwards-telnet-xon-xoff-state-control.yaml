abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new values for use with the telnet com port control
    option's SET-CONTROL sub-command defined in RFC2217. These new values provide
    a mechanism for the telnet client to control and query the outbound Xon/Xoff flow
    control state of the telnet server's physical serial port. This capability is
    exposed in the serial port API on some operating systems and is needed by telnet
    clients that implement a port-redirector service which provides applications local
    to the redirector/telnet-client with transparent access to the remote serial port
    on the telnet server.</p>"
