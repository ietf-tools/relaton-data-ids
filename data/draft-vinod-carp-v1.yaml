abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) v1.0 for
    dividing URL-space among an array of loosely coupled proxy servers. An HTTP client
    agent (either a proxy server or a client browser) which implements CARP v1.0 can
    allocate and intelligently route requests for the correct URLs to any member of
    the Proxy Array. Due to the resulting sorting of requests through these proxies,
    duplication of cache contents is eliminated and global cache hit rates are improved.</p>"
