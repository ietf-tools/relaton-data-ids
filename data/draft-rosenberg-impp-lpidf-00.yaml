abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a data format, the Lightweight Presence Information
    Data Format (LPIDF) for conveying presence information. The format is based on
    RFC822 encoding of presence data. In fact, this encoding is exactly identical
    to the encoding used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in its registration
    messages. This simplifies the process of parsing and processing presence data
    in clients which use SIP for presence or communications services. LPIDF is one
    instantiation of an abstract presence data model also described here.</p>"
