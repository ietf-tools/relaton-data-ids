abstract:
- content: "<p>Concurrent changes in a Multi-Master directory are a partially ordered
    tree. 'LDUP Update Reconciliation Procedures' (URP) uses timestamps to impose
    a strict linear order on this tree, and merges changes to fit that imposed order.
    Merged changes violate the semantics of the LDAP/X.500 data model. No specific
    'modifierName' can be assigned to a merged change and requirements to support
    audit trails and access controls and not to break applications or impede future
    work on transactions cannot be met. The current LDUP requirements draft avoids
    dealing with these critical issues.</p>"
