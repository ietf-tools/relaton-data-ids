abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework defined
    by RFC 2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing. It
    updates the definition of standard-formed packets to include IPv6 packets, deprecates
    the definition of minimal IP packet, and augments distinguishing aspects, referred
    to as Type-P, for test packets in RFC 2330. This memo identifies that IPv4-IPv6
    coexistence can challenge measurements within the scope of the IPPM framework.
    Example use cases include, but are not limited to, IPv4-IPv6 translation, NAT,
    and protocol encapsulation. IPv6 header compression and use of IPv6 over Low-Power
    Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) are considered and excluded from the standard-formed
    packet evaluation.</p>"
