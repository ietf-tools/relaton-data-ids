abstract:
- content: "<p>The high link speed (100Gb/s) in Data Centers (DC) are making network
    transfers complete faster and in fewer RTTs. The short data bursts requires low
    latency while longer data transfer require high throughput. This document describes
    the current state of flow control and congestion handling in the DC using RoCEv2
    and suggests new directions for faster congestion control.</p>"
