abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes multihoming from the perspective of the Internet
    edge: i.e. hosts and other edge networks. We built on top of the previous work
    that describes goals and benefits of multihoming, and identify problems for the
    provisioning of multihoming at the edge level. In this memo, we first look at
    the problem of multihoming for a generic IPv6 node, followed by narrowing the
    analysis down to mobile hosts and networks.</p>"
