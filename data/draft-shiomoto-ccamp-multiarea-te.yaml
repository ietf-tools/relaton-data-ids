abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a traffic engineering framework for multi-layer
    path networks using dynamic virtual topology configuration capability of GMPLS
    protocols. The electrical label switched path is routed over the virtual topology
    built on a set of optical label switched path in multi- layer path networks. The
    virtual topology is dynamically altered by setting up or tearing down optical
    label switched paths. Virtual topol- ogy is configured in response to traffic
    demand change so that conges- tion of the network is mitigated. Utilization of
    label switched path is measured at ingress node and disseminated with routing
    protocol extensions for the individual node to decide whether the virtual topol-
    ogy should be altered or not without centralized coordination.</p>"
