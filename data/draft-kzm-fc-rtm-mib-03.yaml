abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects for information related to routing within a Fibre
    Channel fabric which is independent of the usage of a particular routing protocol.
    At present, this memo is in development as part of the SM-RTM project of T11.5
    (http://www.t11.org). The plan is that it will later become a work item of IETF's
    IMSS working group.</p>"
