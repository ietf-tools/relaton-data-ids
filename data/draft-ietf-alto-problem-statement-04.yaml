abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed applications -- such as file sharing, real-time communication,
    and live and on-demand media streaming -- prevalent on the Internet use a significant
    amount of network resources. Such applications often transfer large amounts of
    data through connections established between nodes distributed across the Internet
    with little knowledge of the underlying network topology. Some applications are
    so designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which
    to exchange data. Absent any topology information guiding such choices, or acting
    on suboptimal or local information obtained from measurements and statistics,
    these applications often make less than desirable choices. This document discusses
    issues related to an information-sharing service that enables applications to
    perform better-than-random peer selection. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
