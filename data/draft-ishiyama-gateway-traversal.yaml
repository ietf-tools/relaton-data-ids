abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an approach of security support for Mobile IP protocol.
    IPSEC and Mobile IP modules are combined and implemented on gateways of all networks
    and mobile nodes. Each component performs IPSEC packet encryption/authentication,
    and Mobile IP processing. Using Next-hop negotiation between security gateways,
    the packet from a mobile node in the visiting network can be delivered to the
    home network through the security gateways in an authenticated way. This mechanism
    allows minimal overhead for traversing security gateways, and minimal information
    to be held on each mobile node.</p>"
