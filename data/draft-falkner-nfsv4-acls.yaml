abstract:
- content: "<p>NFS version 4 (specified in RFC 3530) Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide
    more fine grained control than previous file permission models, but before the
    full benefit of the model can be exploited, some changes and clarifications must
    be made. This document will describe the details that implementors should consider
    in order to allow implementations to function and interoperate better.</p>"
