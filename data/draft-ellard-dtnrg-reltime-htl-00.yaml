abstract:
- content: <p>This draft presents two extensions to the DTN bundle protocol. The first
    extension is the use of relative time rather than absolute time to address situations
    where the DTN nodes cannot achieve loosely synchronized clocks, as required by
    the current DTN bundle protocol. The second extension is the addition of a "hops-to-live"
    field to the bundle header, which specifies how many node-to-node hops each instance
    of a bundle is permitted to make before it expires. These two extensions are separable;
    either may be used independently of the other. Used together, however, they provide
    a powerful way to constrain resources consumed by the handling of a DTN bundle
    despite the absence of synchronized clocks or the presence of incomplete knowledge
    of the network topology (which may lead to the presence of hazards such as routing
    loops).</p>
