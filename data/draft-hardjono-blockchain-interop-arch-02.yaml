abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increasing interest in the potential use of blockchain systems
    for virtual assets, there is a need for these assets to have mobility across blockchain
    systems. An interoperability architecture for blockchain systems is needed in
    order to permit the secure flow of virtual assets between blockchain systems,
    satisfying the properties of transfer atomicity, consistency and durability. The
    architecture must recognize that there are different blockchain systems, and that
    the interior constructs in these blockchains maybe incompatible with one another.
    Gateway nodes perform the transfer of virtual assets between blockchain systems
    while masking the complexity of the interior constructs of the blockchain that
    they represent.</p>"
