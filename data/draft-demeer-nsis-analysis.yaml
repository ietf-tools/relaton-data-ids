abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a brief analysis of existing IP quality of service
    (QoS) solutions and the implied signalling issues. This analysis is intended to
    point out open issues in QoS signalling. Moreover, this analysis is done in order
    to understand whether the strict QoS requirements imposed by future fixed and
    mobile applications are satisfied by the existing IP QoS solutions. The existing
    IP QoS solutions can be categorized as follows: * End-to-end per-flow resource
    reservation protocols * Integrated Services over Differentiated Services * Statically
    assigned trunk reservations based on Differentiated Services * Dynamic trunk reservations
    with Aggregated RSVP</p>"
