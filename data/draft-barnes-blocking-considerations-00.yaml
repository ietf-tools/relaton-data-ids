abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium. This
    openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can allow
    bad communications as well as good. Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms
    to limit the extent and impact of abusive or illegal communications. Recently,
    there has been an increasing emphasis on "blocking", the active prevention of
    abusive or illegal communications. This document examines several technical approaches
    to Internet service blocking in terms of their fit with the overall Internet architecture.
    In general, the approach to service blocking that is most coherent with the Internet
    architecture is to inform endpoints about bad services, so that the communicants
    can avoid engaging in abusive or illegal communications.</p>
