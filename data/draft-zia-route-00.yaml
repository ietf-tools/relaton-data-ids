abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport
    protocol (ROUTE Protocol) is specified for robust delivery of application objects,
    including application objects with real-time delivery constraints, to receivers
    over a unidirectional transport. Application objects consist of data that has
    meaning to applications that use the ROUTE Protocol for delivery of data to receivers,
    for example, it can be a file, or a DASH or HLS segment, a WAV audio clip, etc.
    The ROUTE Protocol also supports low-latency streaming applications. The ROUTE
    Protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast, and multicast transport. Therefore,
    it can be run over IP/UDP including multicast IP. ROUTE Protocol can leverage
    the features of the underlying protocol layer, e.g. to provide security it can
    leverage IP security protocols such as IPSec.</p>"
