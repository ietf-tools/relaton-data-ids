abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY]
    draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems Slice and Service
    Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths in IP and Layer 2 Transport
    networks.The focus of that work is limited to the 3GPP domain (i.e., eNB &lt;-&gt;
    UPFs) and doesn't go beyond the UPF to the IP Data Network. To maintain the end-to-end
    transport network characteristics between UEs and their application servers, the
    framework needs to be extended to the data centers where the services are hosted.
    This document describes a framework for extending the mobility aware transport
    network characteristics from the UPF through the IP Data Networks.</p>"
