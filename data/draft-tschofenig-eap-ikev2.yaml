abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies EAP-IKEv2, an Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) method that is based on the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol. EAP-IKEv2
    provides mutual authentication and session key establishment between an EAP peer
    and an EAP server. It supports authentication techniques that are based on passwords,
    high-entropy shared keys, and public key certificates. EAP-IKEv2 further provides
    support for cryptographic ciphersuite negotiation, hash function agility, identity
    confidentiality (in certain modes of operation), fragmentation, and an optional
    "fast reconnect" mode. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>
