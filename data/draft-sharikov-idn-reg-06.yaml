    internationalized domain names (IDNs) based on (in alphabetical order) Bosnian,
    Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Kildin Sami, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian,
    and Ukrainian languages in a DNS zone. It describes appropriate characters for
    registration and variant considerations for characters from Greek and Latin scripts
    with similar appearances and/or derivations. This document is not an Internet
