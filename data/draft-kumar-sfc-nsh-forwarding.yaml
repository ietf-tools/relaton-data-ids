abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the separation of service forwarding function
    and service delivery function abstractions, along with the mechanics of NSH encapsulated
    packet forwarding with such separation, in SFC deployments. This separation frees
    the service functions from making forwarding decisions and the necessary control
    plane integration, thereby keeping the service functions simple and focused on
    service delivery. Further, this separation fully contains the forwarding decisions
    in forwarding functions, thereby allowing implementations to enforce integrity
    of the forwarding state carried in NSH which in turn is required for correctly
    forwarding NSH encapsulated packets.</p>"
