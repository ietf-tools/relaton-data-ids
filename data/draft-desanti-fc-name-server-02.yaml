abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects for information related to the Fibre Channel network's
    Name Server function. At present, this memo is a work item of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org).
    The plan is that it will later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.</p>"
