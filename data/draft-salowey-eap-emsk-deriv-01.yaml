abstract:
- content: "<p>An Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) is a cryptographic key generated
    from an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) exchange reserved solely for
    the purpose of deriving master keys for one or more purposes identified as usage
    definitions. This document specifies a mechanism for deriving cryptographically
    separate root keys from the EMSK, called usage specific root Keys (USRK). The
    document provides a set of requirements for avoiding conflicts between usage definitions
    to ensure this cryptographic separation. The USRK is used according to the usage
    definition defined for a specific purpose.</p>"
