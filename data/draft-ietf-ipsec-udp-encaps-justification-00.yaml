abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft explains the design justification and alternatives for two
    IPsec over NAT drafts, UDP Encapsulation of IPsec Packets, [Hutt01] and [Kiv00].
    This draft sets the requirements for a solution in terms of scenarios in which
    NAT is used, and NAT operations. This draft is specifies the requirements for
    IPsec NAT traversal, scenarios these extensions enable, and design rationale for
    the proposed solution. This draft assumes that the reader is familiar with the
    interactions of NAT with IPsec documented in [Aboba04].</p>"
