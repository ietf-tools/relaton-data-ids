abstract:
- content: "<p>As the increasing use of DNSSEC and IPv6, there are more public evidence
    and concerns on IPv6 fragmentation issues due to larger DNS payloads over IPv6.
    This memo introduces an simple improvement on DNS server by replying an additional
    truncated response just after the normal fragmented response. It can be used to
    relieve users suffering on DNS latency and failures due to large DNS response.
    It also can be utilized as a measuring and troubleshooting tool to locate the
    issue and conquer. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document with
    test script is currently placed at GitHub [ATR-Github]. Comments and pull request
    are welcome.</p>"
