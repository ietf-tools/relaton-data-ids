abstract:
- content: <p>This document is a summary of the results of meetings with actual manufacturers
    of industrial products, companies that establish and run social infrastructures
    (hereafter referred to as "Things companies"), and ICT enterprises about the challenges
    they face in realizing IoT. These meetings revealed that the Things companies
    are troubled by such as the vast gap between the product lifetimes of their company
    products and the pace at which generation changes occur in ICT technologies, the
    difference between the actual values and catalog values of the wave traveling
    ranges, and the enormous number of sensors that need to be installed. In order
    to deploy about IoT, we believe that the solutions to these primitive issues must
    be promoted in tandem with a service-oriented approach that places an emphasis
    on the effects.</p>
