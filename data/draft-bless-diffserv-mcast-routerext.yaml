abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an extension to the multicast routing table in
    routers in order to achieve better support for using multicast within Differentiated
    Services (DS) networks. Only one additional DS codepoint for each virtual interface
    in the multicast routing table is required to open up a variety of different uses,
    e.g., to solve resource provisioning problems or to support heterogeneous DiffServ
    multicast groups.</p>"
