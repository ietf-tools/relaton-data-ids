abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network
    (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4. This and other similar link
    technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.
    In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept
    of IP subnets and IP links. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-
    transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept
    and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in
    a low-power and lossy network. This document describes simple optimizations to
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection
    for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks. The document
    thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
