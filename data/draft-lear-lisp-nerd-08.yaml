abstract:
- content: "<p>LISP is a protocol to encapsulate IP packets in order to allow end
    sites to multihome without injecting routes from one end of the Internet to another.
    This memo presents an experimental database and a discussion of methods to transport
    the mapping of EIDs to RLOCs to routers in a reliable, scalable, and secure manner.
    Our analysis concludes that transport of of all EID/RLOC mappings scales well
    to at least 10^8 entries.</p>"
