abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC4090 documents facility backup FRR in MPLS-TE networks. This document
    describes methods that allow the Point of Local Repair (PLR) to find a path with
    sufficient available bandwidth to accommodate protected traffic, while not making
    undesired reservations that would require additional capacity. Below aspects are
    covered: * Automatic determination of bypass required bandwidth by the PLR * Calculation
    of path based on this information using constrained shortest path algorithm (CSPF)
    * Determination of RSVP SENDER-TSPEC rate value for bypass tunnel signaling</p>"
