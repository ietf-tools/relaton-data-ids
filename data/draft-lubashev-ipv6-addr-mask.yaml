abstract:
- content: '<p>Since network operators are commonly assigned at least /48 IPv6 address
    prefixes, the operators and standards occasionally find opportunities to devise
    addressing schemes that further assign operational semantics to less significant
    bit ranges. There is currently no standard or interoperable textual representation
    of addresses sharing bit patterns that are not prefixes. This RFC introduces IPv6
    Address/Mask notation that allows one to represent address groupings beyond "all
    addresses that share a single prefix". The representation is similar to the IPv4
    address/mask notation in its expressiveness, but it is derived from the familiar
    address/ prefix-length notation for clarity and compatibility with existing parsers.
    For example, using this representation, both 2001:db8::/32 and 2001:db8:://ffff:ffff::
    have the same meaning. However, a group of addresses having the first 32 bits
    "2001:0db8::" and the last 16 bits "::1234" requires the new representation: 2001:db8::1234//ffff:ffff::ffff
    or, equivalently, 2001:db8::1234//32+::ffff.</p>'
