abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution framework for overcoming the limitations
    of existing Multicast VPN (MVPN) and VPLS multicast solutions. It describes procedures
    for enhancing the scalability of multicast for BGP/MPLS VPNs. It also describes
    procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the sevice provider
    (SP) network. The procedures described here reduce the overhead of PIM neighbor
    relationships that a PE router needs to maintain for BGP/MPLS VPNs. They also
    reduce the state (and the overhead of maintaining the state) in the SP network
    by removing the need to maintain in the SP network at least one dedicated multicast
    tree per each VPN.</p>"
