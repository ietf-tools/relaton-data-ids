abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a method to achieve Fast Handoffs in Mobile IPv4.
    Fast Handoffs are required in Mobile IPv4 in order to limit the period of service
    disruption experienced by a wireless Mobile Node when moving between Foreign Agents.
    This requirement becomes even more important when supporting real-time services.
    Fast Handoffs involve anticipating the movement of MNs by sending multiple copies
    of the traffic to potential Mobile Node movement locations (i.e. FAs). Both a
    flat and a Hierarchical Mobile IPv4 model are considered. The Hierarchical MIPv4
    model in Regional Tunnel Management [1] already offers improvements to Mobile
    IP handoffs by providing local Home Agent functionality. Some additions are made
    to the operation of this existing Hierarchical model to achieve Fast Handoffs
    and limit or avoid triangle routing within the hierarchical domain.</p>"
