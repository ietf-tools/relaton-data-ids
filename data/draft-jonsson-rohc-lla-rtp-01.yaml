abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a ROHC profile for compression of IP/UDP/RTP
    packets, utilizing functionality provided by the lower layer to increase compression
    efficiency by completely eliminating the header for most packets during normal
    operation. The profile is built as an extension to the ROHC RTP profile [ROHC].
    It defines additional mechanisms needed in ROHC, states requirements on the lower
    layer to guarantee transparency, and specifies general logic for compression and
    decompression making use of this header-free packet.</p>"
