abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC2780 specifies the registration policy for reserved TCP header flags
    as Standards Action. RFC3168 created an IANA registry for these header flags and
    registered bit 8 (CWR) and 9 (ECE). This draft changes the registration policy
    of the registration to IETF Review as usually new TCP mechanisms that could use
    the remaining reserved flags will be first specified as experimental. Not noting
    any of those experiments in the registry would undermine the purpose of having
    a registry. However, care must be taken, as only a few reserved flags are left
    and if a new (experimental) mechanism sees deployment in the Internet, the flag
    cannot be unassigned anymore or used for something else.</p>"
