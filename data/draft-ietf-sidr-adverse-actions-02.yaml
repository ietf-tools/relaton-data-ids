abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes actions by or against a CA or independent repository
    manager in the RPKI that can adversely affect the Internet Number Resources (INRs)
    associated with that CA or its subordinate CAs. The analysis is based on examination
    of the data items in the RPKI repository, as controlled by a CA (or independent
    repository manager) and fetched by Relying Parties (RPs). The analysis is performed
    from the perspective of an affected INR holder. The analysis does not purport
    to be comprehensive; it does represent an orderly way to analyze a number of ways
    that errors by or attacks against a CA or repository manager can affect the RPKI
    and routing decisions based on RPKI data.</p>"
