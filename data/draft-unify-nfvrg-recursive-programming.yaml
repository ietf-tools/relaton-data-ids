abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in carrier-
    grade networks promises improved operations in terms of flexibility, efficiency,
    and manageability. NFV is an approach to combine network and compute virtualizations
    together. However, network and compute resource domains expose different virtualizations
    and programmable interfaces. In [I-D.unify-nfvrg-challenges] we argued for a joint
    compute and network virtualization by looking into different compute abstractions.
    In this document we analyze different approaches to orchestrate a service graph
    with transparent network functions relying on a public telecommunication network
    and ending in a commodity data center. We show that a recursive compute and network
    joint virtualization and programming has clear advantages compared to other approaches
    with separated control between compute and network resources. In addition, the
    joint virtualization will have cost and performance advantages by removing additional
    virtualization overhead. The discussion of the problems and the proposed solution
    is generic for any data center use case; however, we use NFV as an example.</p>"
