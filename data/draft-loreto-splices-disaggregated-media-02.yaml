abstract:
- content: "<p>Disaggregated media refers to the ability for a user to create a multimedia
    session combining different media streams, coming from different devices under
    his or her control, so that they are treated by the far end of the session as
    a single media session. This document lists several use cases that involve disaggregated
    media in SIP. Additionally, this document analyzes what types of disaggregated
    media can be implemented using existing protocol mechanisms, and the pros and
    cons of using each of those mechanisms. Finally, this document describes scenarios
    that are not covered by current mechanisms and proposes new IETF work to cover
    them.</p>"
