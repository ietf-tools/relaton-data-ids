abstract:
- content: "<p>Group Based Policy can be used to achieve micro or macro segmentation
    of user traffic. For Group Based Policy, a Group Policy ID, also known as Group
    Policy Tag, is used to represent a logical group that shares the same policy and
    access privilege. This specification defines a new BGP extended community that
    can be used to propagate Group Policy ID through a BGP route advertisement in
    the control plane. This is to facilitate policy enforcement at the ingress node
    when the optimization of network bandwidth is desired.</p>"
