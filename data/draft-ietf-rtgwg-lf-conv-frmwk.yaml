abstract:
- content: "<p>A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently
    among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm. This framework
    provides a summary of the causes and consequences of micro-loops and enables the
    reader to form a judgement on whether micro-looping is an issue that needs to
    be addressed in specific networks. It also provides a survey of the currently
    proposed mechanisms that may be used to prevent or to suppress the formation of
    micro-loops when an IP or MPLS network undergoes topology change due to failure,
    repair, or management action. When sufficiently fast convergence is not available
    and the topology is susceptible to micro-loops, use of one or more of these mechanisms
    may be desirable. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
