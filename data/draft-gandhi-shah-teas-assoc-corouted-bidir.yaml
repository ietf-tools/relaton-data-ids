abstract:
- content: "<p>In transport networks, there are requirements where reverse unidirectional
    LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as its forward unidirectional
    LSP. This document describes how RSVP Extended ASSOCIATION Object can be used
    to bind two co-routed point-to-point unidirectional LSPs into an associated co-routed
    bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning case. The RSVP REVERSE_LSP Object
    is used to enable an endpoint to trigger creation of the reverse LSP along the
    same path as the forward LSP. Fast-reroute procedures to ensure that the traffic
    flows on the co- routed path after a failure event are also described.</p>"
