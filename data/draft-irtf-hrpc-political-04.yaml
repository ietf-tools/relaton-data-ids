abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be used on
    networks, but the standards development process in the IETF does have an impact
    on society through its normative standards setting process. This document aims
    to bring about a better understanding on the political nature of standards and
    protocols. Among other things, the IETF's work affects what is perceived as technologically
    possible and useful where networking technologies are being deployed, and its
    standards reflect what is considered by the technical community to be feasible
    and good practice. Whereas there might not be agreement among the Internet protocol
    community on the specific political nature of the technological development process
    and its outputs, it is undisputed that standards and protocols are both products
    of a political process, and they can also be used for political means.</p>"
