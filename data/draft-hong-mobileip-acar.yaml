abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes Access Router (AR) based movement detection
    and Care-of Address (CoA) configuration for fast handover in Mobile IPv6. An Active
    Access Router (AcAR) which will serve a Mobile Node (MN) performs movement detection,
    formulates a new CoA of the MN and does Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) on behalf
    of the MN. After confirming the uniqueness of the new CoA, the AcAR sends it through
    a RA message. Since an AcAR can quickly determine the L3 movement by the comparison
    between neighbor caches and L2 information of a MN, a MN does not have to wait
    to receive RA messages from ARs. Thus, the movement detection delay is reduced.
    Since DAD is performed by an AcAR in advance, a MN does not have to do normal
    DAD and it can use the new CoA for its interface directly.</p>"
