abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes how the HIP control packets can be used to
    send requests for preferred certificates to the correspondent hosts, and also
    requests for a Certification Authority (CA) to issue a certificate. The document
    specifies two new HIP parameters CERT_REQ and CERT_SIGN_REQ and describes their
    use. The means as to how to signal an error in case of the desired certificate
    is not available is also discussed. The syntax of certificates and certificate
    requests is out of scope of the document and defined elsewhere.</p>"
