abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces the specification of a TFRC sender-based protocol.
    This protocol is based on TFRC [2] congestion control and SACK [1] mechanism.
    It enlights TFRC processing for the receiver and provides a robust architecture
    against selfish receiver behavior. This protocol remains compliant to the common
    TFRC as defined in [2].</p>"
