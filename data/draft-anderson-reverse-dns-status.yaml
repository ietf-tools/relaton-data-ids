abstract:
- content: "<p>Translation of IP addresses to domain names is an optional feature
    of DNS. Many sites implement it in someway, many others do not implement it at
    all. Over time, some myths have developed regarding reverse DNS mapping. The goal
    of this document is to to identify best practices, illuminate false assumptions
    and to report on the status of reverse DNS facilities so that DNS Administrators
    and operators can make informed decisions about the options for DNS reverse mapping.</p>"
