abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream Control
    Transmisson Protocol) as the transport between SIP entities. SCTP is a new protocol
    which provides several features that may prove beneficial for transport between
    SIP entities which exchange a large amount of messages, including gateways and
    proxies. As SIP is transport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively straightforward
    process, nearly identical to support for TCP.</p>"
