abstract:
- content: <p>DHCPv4 (RFC 2131) is a stable, widely used protocol for configuration
    of host systems in a TCP/IPv4 network. It did not provide for authentication of
    clients and servers, nor did it provide for data confidentiality. This is reflected
    in the original "Security Considerations" section of RFC 2131, which identifies
    a few threats and leaves development of any defenses against those threats to
    future work. In about 1995, DHCP security began to attract attention from the
    Internet community, eventually resulting in the publication of RFC 3118 in 2001.
    Although RFC 3118 was a mandatory prerequisite for the DHCPv4 Reconfigure Extension,
    RFC 3203, it has had no known usage by any commercial or private implementation
    since its adoption. The DHC Working Group adopted a work item for 2003 to review
    and modify or replace RFC 3118 to afford a workable, easily deployed security
    mechanism for DHCPv4. This memo provides a threat analysis of the Dynamic Host
    Configuration Protocol for Ipv4 (DHCPv4) for use both as RFC 2131 advances from
    Draft Standard to Full Standard and to support our chartered work improving the
    acceptance and deployment of RFC 3118.</p>
