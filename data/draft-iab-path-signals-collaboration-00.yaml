abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses principles for designing mechanisms that use
    or provide path signals, and calls for standards action in specific valuable cases.
    RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages to or from on-path elements, and points
    out that visible information will be used whether it is intended as a signal or
    not. The principles in this document are intended as guidance for the design of
    explicit path signals, which are encouraged to be authenticated and include a
    minimal set of parties and minimize information sharing. These principles can
    be achieved through mechanisms like encryption of information and establishing
    trust relationships between entities on a path.</p>"
