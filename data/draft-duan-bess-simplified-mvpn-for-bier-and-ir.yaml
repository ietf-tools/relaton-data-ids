abstract:
- content: "<p>Per RFC6513 and RFC6514, seven MCAST-VPN NLRIs and relevant procedures
    are defined to build multicast forwarding tree over the service provider backbone.
    RFC8556 introduces that MVPN can use BIER as PMSI tunnel to perform optimal multicast
    forwarding. However, the complicated NLRI exchange and the switching from I-PMSI
    to S-PMSI tunnel is not necessary for BIER and IR tunnel. The architectural advantages
    of BIER and IR cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, a new simplified MVPN for
    BIER and IR is proposed to substitute current NLRIs exchange and procedures. This
    document would like to discuss the value of the MVPN simplification and provide
    suggestive solution.</p>"
