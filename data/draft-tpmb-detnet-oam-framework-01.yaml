abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet), as defined in RFC 8655, is aimed
    to provide a bounded end-to-end latency on top of the network infrastructure,
    comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments. This document's primary
    purpose is to detail the specific requirements of the Operation, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) recommended to maintain a deterministic network. With the
    implementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have a real-time
    view of the network infrastructure regarding the network's ability to respect
    the Service Level Objective, such as packet delay, delay variation, and packet
    loss ratio, assigned to each data flow.</p>"
