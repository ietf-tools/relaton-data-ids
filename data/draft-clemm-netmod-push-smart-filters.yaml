abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG model for Smart Filters for push updates.
    Smart Filters allow to filter push updates based on values of pushed datastore
    nodes and/or state, such as previous updates. Smart Filters provide an important
    building block for service assurance and network automation. This revision of
    the document is intended as a placeholder, containing the problem statement of
    draft-clemm-netconf-push-smart- filters-ps-00 that has recently expired. The YANG
    model itself still needs to be defined.</p>"
