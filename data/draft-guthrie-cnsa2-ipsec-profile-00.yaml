abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a base profile for IPsec for use with the US
    Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a cybersecurity advisory
    that outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm policy for national security
    applications. This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation
    of all components of US National Security Systems that employ IPsec. It is also
    appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information,
    and. This profile is made publicly available for use by developers and operators
    of these and any other system deployments.</p>"
