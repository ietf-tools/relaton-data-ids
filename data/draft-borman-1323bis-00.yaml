abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performance over
    large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliable operation over very
    high-speed paths. It defines new TCP options for scaled windows and timestamps,
    which are designed to provide compatible interworking with TCP's that do not implement
    the extensions. The timestamps are used for two distinct mechanisms: RTTM (Round
    Trip Time Measurement) and PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped Sequences). Selective
    acknowledgments are not included in this memo. This memo updates and obsoletes
    RFC-1323 [Jacobson92d].</p>"
