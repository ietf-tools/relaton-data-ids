abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field core to an IPv6 transport such as an MPLS LDPv6 core or SRv6 core, Multiprotocol
    BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of the core from IPv4
    to IPv6 being able to continue to support legacy IPv4, VPN-IPv4, and Multicast
    VPN customers. IXPs (Internet Exchange points) are also facing IPv4 address depletion
    at their peering points, which are large Layer 2 transit backbones that service
    providers peer and exchange IPv4 and IPv6 (Network Layer Reachability Information)
    NLRI. Today these transit exchange points are dual stacked. One proposal to solve
    this issue is to use [RFC5549] to carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information)
    NLRI in an IPv6 next hop and eliminate the IPv4 peering completely using the concept
    of [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework. So now with the MP-BGP reach capability
    exchanged over IPv4 AFI over IPv6 next hop peer we can now advertise IPv4(Network
    Layer Reachability Information) NLRI over IPv6 peering using the [RFC5565] softwire
    mesh framework. Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop
    address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the
    Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). Historically the AFI/SAFI definitions
    for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a Next Hop address
    that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 or VPN-IPv4 Network Layer
    Reachability Information (NLRI). [RFC5549] specifies the extensions necessary
    to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs
    to the IPv6 protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions
    to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong
    to the IPv6 Protocol. [RFC5549] defines the encoding of the Next Hop to determine
    which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability
    allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI
    and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop. With this new MP-BGP capability exchange
    allows the BGP peering session to act as a pure transport to allow the session
    to carry Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI) for both IPv4 and IPv6. This document describes the critical use case and
    OPEX savings of being able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange usage as
    a pure transport allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the same BGP TCP
    session. By doing so allows for the elimination of Dual Stacking on the PE-CE
    connections making the peering IPv6 only carrying both IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer
    Reachability Information (NLRI). This document also provides a possible solution
    for IXPs (Internet Exchange points) that are facing IPv4 address depletion at
    these peering points to use BGP-MP capability exchange defined in [RFC5549] to
    carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI in an IPv6 next hop using
    the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.</p>"
