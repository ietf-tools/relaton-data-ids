abstract:
- content: '<p>This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises from
    the desire to treat a set or group of names as "aliases" of each other, "bundled,"
    "variants," or "the same," which is problematic in terms of corresponding behavior
    for DNS labels. With the emergence of internationalized domain names, among other
    potential use cases, two or more names that users will regard as having identical
    meaning will sometimes require corresponding behavior in the DNS. It''s not clear
    how to accommodate these requirements for behavior of such names in DNS resolution;
    in particular, it''s not clear when they are best accommodated in registry practices
    for generating names for lookup in the DNS, existing DNS protocol elements and
    behavior, or some set of protocol elements or behavior not yet defined. This document
    attempts to describe some of these cases and the behavior of some of the possible
    solutions discussed to date. NOTE: Even more than usual, version -02 of this document
    is a "work in progress". Additional updates may be expected between the date of
    this document and the DNSEXT meeting in Beijing, and can be found at http://users.isc.org/~woolf.</p>'
