    for Signalling User Adaptation Protocols [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [ISUA], [TUA],
    which permits supporting Signalling Gateways (SG) to convey additional Application
    Server (AS) support information to Application Server Processes (ASPs) activating
    for AS on the SG. This additional AS support information consists of information
    pertaining to the underlying SS7 Signalling Provider that otherwise would have
    to be statically configured at the Application Server Process (ASP) or exchanged
    between SG and ASP using a non-IETF defined protocol.</p>"
