abstract:
- content: "<p>DOTS client signal using original signal communication channel can
    expect service degradation and even service disruption as any other service over
    Internet but in more severe conditions because the signal may have to be transmitted
    over congested paths due to the denial-of-service attack. This document specifies
    a fall-back asynchronous mechanism using an intermediate agent to store DOTS signal
    information during a limited period of time. This mechanism allows a DOTS server
    to request a signal information stored by a DOTS client when no heartbeat is received
    from the DOTS client. This intermediate agent called DOTS Signal Repository have
    to be connected to the DOTS client and server independently. The repository must
    be located and/or reached through one or multiple network paths, preferably as
    most as possible disjoint from regular signal channel, in order to increase its
    reachability. The document introduces a set of support protocols to build the
    asynchronous communication between the DOTS cient, server and the repository.</p>"
