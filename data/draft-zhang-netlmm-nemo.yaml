abstract:
- content: "<p>The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for network-
    based localized mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support for registration,
    de-registration and handover of single Mobile Node (MN) into account in the RFC
    5213 [1]. When a whole subnet moves into the PMIPv6 domain through the Mobile
    Router (MR), the scheme should be considered to provide and maintain the connectivity
    for the Mobile Network Node (MNN) in the mobile network (NEMO). This document
    discusses the deployment consideration of NEMO support in PMIPv6 network and proposes
    the possible solution accordingly.</p>"
