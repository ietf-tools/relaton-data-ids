abstract:
- content: <p>Both WebDAV servers and clients frequently map URI-escaped characters
    inside a path segment to non-ASCII characters. These mappings can only be interoperable
    if there is a consensus about the appropriate character encoding. This document
    specifies a default encoding that is compatible with both the recommendations
    for URIs in HTML content and the "Internationalized Resource Identifiers" (IRI)
    specification. Furthermore, servers that implement a mapping to locally constrained
    names frequently do not support specific names, or silently map "similar" names
    to the same resource (for instance when content is stored in a filesystem that
    is case-preserving, but not case- sensitive). For these cases, discovery and error
    signalling features are defined.</p>
