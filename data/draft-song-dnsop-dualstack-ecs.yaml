abstract:
- content: "<p>During the period of IPv6 transition, IP-based Geolocation (GeoIP)
    applications are identified as a challenge and speed bump for ICPs (Internet Content
    Providers) to migrating their service to IPv6. Some studies and operational experiences
    show that the accuracy of IPv6 GeoIP is relatively poor in comparison to their
    IPv4 counterparts. This memo proposed to include client's dualstack subnets into
    DNS queries to provide better IPv6 GeoIP. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source
    of the document with test script is currently placed at GitHub [Dualstack-ECS-GitHub].
    Comments and pull request are welcome.</p>"
