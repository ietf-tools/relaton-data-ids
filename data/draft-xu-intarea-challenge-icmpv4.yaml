abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) plays a crucial role in
    network diagnostics and error reporting. However, it is a challenge to verify
    the legitimacy of a received ICMP error message, particularly when the ICMP error
    message is embedded with stateless protocol data. As a result, adversaries can
    forge ICMP error messages, leading to potential exploitation and off-path attacks.
    This document explores solutions to this problem by first presenting a straightforward
    but flawed stateful challenge-response mechanism. It explains how this "strawman"
    approach, while preventing simple spoofing, introduces a severe vulnerability
    to state-exhaustion Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Building on this analysis,
    the document then proposes a robust, stateless challenge-response mechanism inspired
    by TCP SYN-Cookies. This final proposal eliminates the need to store per-challenge
    state by computationally generating challenges. It limits state management to
    minimal flags on existing sockets or a bounded probabilistic data structure. This
    approach effectively authenticates ICMP error messages while inherently resisting
    both off-path spoofing and state- exhaustion DoS attacks, thus significantly improving
    the robustness of ICMP. Additionally, it discusses security and deployment considerations
    to ensure its practical implementation.</p>
