- content: "<p>This document examines the problems and challenges associated with
    the process of setting up secure virtual network connections among authorized
    network nodes. The network nodes can be located anywhere in a private or public
    network, directly connected or behind one or more levels of NAT. Setting up a
    secure virtual network in this environment entails the resolution of various issues
    such as authentication, peer discovery, virtual network address management, and
    connection parameters determination.</p>"
