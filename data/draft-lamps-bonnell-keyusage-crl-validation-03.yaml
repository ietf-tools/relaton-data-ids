abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5280 defines the profile of X.509 certificates and certificate
    revocation lists (CRLs) for use in the Internet. This profile requires that certificates
    which certify keys for signing CRLs contain the key usage extension with the cRLSign
    bit asserted. Additionally, RFC 5280 defines steps for the validation of CRLs.
    While there is a requirement for CRL validators to verify that the cRLSign bit
    is asserted in the keyUsage extension of the CRL issuer's certificate, this document
    clarifies the requirement for relying parties to also verify the presence of the
    keyUsage extension in the CRL issuer's certificate. This check remediates a potential
    security issue that arises when relying parties accept a CRL which is signed by
    a certificate with no keyUsage extension, and therefore does not explicitly have
    the cRLSign bit asserted.</p>"
