abstract:
- content: "<p>The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes
    query parameter serialization, which means that Authorization Request parameters
    are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web
    browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that (a) the communication through
    the user agents are not integrity protected and thus the parameters can be tainted,
    and (b) the source of the communication is not authenticated. Because of these
    weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward. This document
    introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead,
    which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and/or encrypted
    with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication and
    confidentiality property of the Authorization Request is attained. The request
    can be sent by value or by reference.</p>"
