abstract:
- content: "<p>Often an intermediate instance (such as a proxy server) is used to
    connect to a web server or a communicating peer if a direct end-to- end IP connectivity
    is not possible or the proxy can provide a support service like, e.g., address
    anonymisation. To use a non- transparent proxy a client explicitly connects to
    it and requests forwarding to the final target server. The MASQUE Connect-UDP
    Proxy service is an example of such a proxy service. The client either knows the
    proxy address as preconfigured in the application or can dynamically learn about
    available proxy services. This document describes different discovery mechanisms
    for non-transparent proxies that are either located in the local network, e.g.
    home or enterprise network, in the access network, or somewhere else on the Internet
    usually close to the target server or even in the same network as the target server.
    This document assumes that the non-transparent proxy server is connected via QUIC
    and discusses potential discovery mechanisms for such a QUIC-based, non-transparent
    proxy.</p>"
