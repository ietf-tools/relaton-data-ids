abstract:
- content: "<p>Autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) is a generic platform for tenant
    applications (i.e. AFs). As we will see in some examplery use cases, AFs may not
    only require communication capability supported from the infrastructure side,
    but also the capability the infrastructure can hold and re-distribute information
    on-demand. This document proposes a solution for information distribution in the
    ANI. Information distribution is categorized into two different modes: 1) instantaneous
    distribution and 2) publication for retrieval. In the former case, the information
    is sent, propagated and disposed of after reception. In the latter case, information
    needs to be stored in the network. The capability to distribute information is
    a basic and fundamental need for an autonomous network ([RFC7575]). This document
    describes typical use cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements
    to ANI, such that rich information distribution can be natively supported. The
    document proposes extensions to the autonomic nodes and suggests an implementation
    based on GRASP ([I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]) extensions as a protocol on the wire.</p>"
