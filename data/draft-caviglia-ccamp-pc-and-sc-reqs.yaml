abstract:
- content: "<p>From a Carrier perspective, the possibility of turning a Permanent
    Connection (PC) into a Soft Permanent Connection (SPC) and vice versa, without
    actually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried over it, is a valuable option.
    In other terms, such operation can be seen as a way of transferring the ownership
    and control of an existing and in-use Data Plane connection between the Management
    Plane and the Control Plane, leaving its Data Plane state untouched. This memo
    sets out the requirements for such procedures within a Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) network.</p>"
