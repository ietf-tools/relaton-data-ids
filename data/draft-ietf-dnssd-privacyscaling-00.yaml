abstract:
- content: <p>DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about
    both the devices offering services and the devices requesting services. This information
    includes host names, network parameters, and possibly a further description of
    the corresponding service instance. Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS
    Service Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public hotspot, a serious privacy problem
    arises. The draft currently progressing in the DNS-SD Working Group assumes peer-to-peer
    pairing between the service to be discovered and each of its clients. This has
    good security properties, but creates scaling issues, because each server needs
    to publish as many announcements as it has paired clients. This leads to large
    number of operations when servers are paired with many clients. Different designs
    are possible. For example, if there was only one server "discovery key" known
    by each authorized client, each server would only have to announce a single record,
    and clients would only have to process one response for each server that is present
    on the network. Yet, these designs will present different privacy profiles, and
    pose different management challenges. This draft analyses the tradeoffs between
    privacy and scaling in a set of different designs, using either shared secrets
    or public keys.</p>
