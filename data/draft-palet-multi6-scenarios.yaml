abstract:
- content: "<p>Multihoming seems to be one of the key pieces for the deployment of
    IPv6 in the enterprise scenario, but is becoming a frequent requirement in all
    kinds of networks. In addition, other factors including the deployment of broadband
    networks, the increase in the variety of access technologies, the increase in
    the demand for resilience/redundancy, etc., in non-enterprise environments, for
    example in SOHO/home, necessarily imply the increase of IPv6 multihoming demand
    for a number of scenarios, which are described in this memo.</p>"
