abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols
    to prevent local transient forwarding loops in case of link failure. This mechanism
    Proposes a two-steps convergence by introducing a delay between the convergence
    of the node adjacent to the topology change and the network wide convergence.
    As this mechanism delays the IGP convergence it may only be used for planned maintenance
    or when fast reroute protects the traffic between the link failure and the IGP
    convergence. Simulations using real network topologies have been performed and
    show that local loops are a significant portion (&gt;50%) of the total forwarding
    loops.</p>"
