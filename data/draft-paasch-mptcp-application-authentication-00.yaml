abstract:
- content: <p>Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [3], is an extension to TCP to provide
    the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between hosts. MPTCP currently
    specifies a single authentication mechanism, using keys that are initially exchanged
    in the clear. There are application-layer protocols that may have better information
    as to the identity of the parties and so is able to better provide keying material
    that could be used for the authentication of future subflows. This document specifies
    "application layer authentication" for Multipath TCP, an alternatively negotiated
    keying mechanism for MPTCP.</p>
