abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in IPv6-in-
    IPv4 automatic tunnels. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to take advantage
    of inconsistencies between a tunnel's overlay IPv6 routing state and the native
    IPv6 routing state. The attack forms a routing loop which can be abused as a vehicle
    for traffic amplification to facilitate DoS attacks. The first aim of this document
    is to inform on this attack and its root causes. The second aim is to present
    some possible mitigation measures.</p>"
