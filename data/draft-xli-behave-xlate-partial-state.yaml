abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents concepts and implementations of stateless/ partial-state
    1:N network address and protocol translation between IPv4 and IPv6 nodes. Stateless
    1:N translation keeps the features of stateless, end-to-end address transparency
    and bidirectional-initiated communications of the original stateless translation
    (1:1 IVI), in addition it can utilize the IPv4 addresses more effectively. However,
    it requires the modification of the IPv6 end systems or deploying home gateways.
    By introducing "partial state" in the translator, this requirement is not necessary.</p>
