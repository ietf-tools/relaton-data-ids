abstract:
- content: "<p>Some recent Internet technology developments relate to improvements
    in communications latency. For instance, improvements in radio communications
    or the recent work in IETF transport, security, and web protocols. There are also
    potential applications where latency would play a more significant role than it
    has traditionally been in the Internet communications. Modern networking systems
    offer many tools for building low-latency networks, from highly optimised individual
    protocol components to software controlled, virtualised and tailored network functions.
    This memo views the developments from a system viewpoint, and considers the potential
    future stresses that the strive for low-latency support for applications may bring.</p>"
