abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocols specified in current EAI documents such as RFC5335, RFC5336
    and RFC5504 are in experimental category. Many organizations have implemented
    and tested the internationalized email systems. Recently, many discussions focus
    on the issues of downgrading implementation and testing. This memo provides some
    analysis in depth about downgrade testing, which will help us deploy the EAI system
    and the re-charter work of the working group in the near future.</p>"
