abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding format
    for the US NIST's PQC KEM (United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's
    Post Quantum Cryptography Key Encapsulation Mechanism) algorithms. The algorithms
    covered are Candidate TBD1. The encoding for public key and private key is also
    provided. [EDNOTE: This draft is not expected to be finalized before the NIST
    PQC Project has standardized PQ algorithms. After NIST has standardized its first
    algorithms, this document will replace TBD, with the appropriate algorithms and
    parameters before proceeding to ratification. The algorithm Dilithium has been
    added as an example in this draft, to provide a more detailed illustration of
    the content - it by no means indicates its inclusion in the final version. This
    specification will use object identifiers for the new algorithms that are assigned
    by NIST, and will use placeholders until these are released.]</p>"
