abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a compilation of issues found since the publication
    of RFC 4960 in September 2007, based on experience with implementing, testing,
    and using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) along with the suggested
    fixes. This document provides deltas to RFC 4960 and is organized in a time-ordered
    way. The issues are listed in the order in which they were brought up. Because
    some text is changed several times, the last delta in the text is the one that
    should be applied. In addition to the deltas, a description of each problem and
    the details of the solution for each are also provided.</p>"
