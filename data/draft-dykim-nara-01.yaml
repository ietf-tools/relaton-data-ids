abstract:
- content: "<p>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The
    Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous domains, each being a collection
    of nodes. Each domain is named by a global address whereas each node by a local
    address. Inter-domain routing depends solely on domain addresses while intra-domain
    routing on node addresses. Routing based on node or domain addresses render inherent
    mobility as well as seamless multi-homing capability. The model can recursively
    repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability,
    for example, to inter-planetary as well as body area networks.</p>"
