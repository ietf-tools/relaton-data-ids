abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the DNS resolver (DNSR) option used to advertise
    on a link IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers. The DNSR option, which lists the IPv6
    addresses of DNS resolvers that all nodes of the link may use to resolve name
    or address, is attached to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisement messages
    that are sent across a link. This document specifies the process used by a host
    to decide how to configure the IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers that the host could
    use in IPv6 networks. This document defines the mechanism by which a node processes
    the DNSR option and updates valid IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers.</p>"
