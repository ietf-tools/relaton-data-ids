abstract:
- content: "<p>FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides
    mobility, multihoming and multipath support by introducing the concept of 'upper
    layer thread ID', which was firstly suggested in [Gao2002]. Authencity of an FSP
    packet is protected by some algorithm that requires a shared key. The upper layer
    thread ID is assigned roughly the same semantics as the Security Parameter Index
    (SPI) in MOBIKE [RFC4555] to index the key. The key is either a weak one agreed
    by the FSP participants, or cryptographically established and installed by the
    upper layer application. FSP facilitates such key installation by introducing
    the concept of transmit transaction, which makes it flexible for the application
    layer protocols to adopt new establishment algorithm.</p>"
