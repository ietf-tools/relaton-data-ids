abstract:
- content: "<p>At the IETF, we currently use a set of methods to communicate a point
    of view, to solicit input, to resolve conflict and attempt to obtain consensus
    within the group. These methods include: writing an Internet Draft, discussion
    on email lists, discussion at face-to- face, interim or virtual meetings, and
    design teams. At times, these methods fall short. People become entrenched in
    their positions. A Working Group may be split 80-20 or 70-30 for a prolonged period.
    This wastes time and energy and may have a lasting impact. This document discusses
    the benefits and drawbacks of each of the current methods of communication focusing
    solely on their efficacy at conflict resolution. A companion document will propose
    some solutions including alternative methods of conflict resolution.</p>"
