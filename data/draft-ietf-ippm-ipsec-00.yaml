abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable implementations.
    Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly gaining popularity in several
    deployment scenarios, not the least in what used to be solely areas of traditional
    telecommunication protocols. Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods
    that enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and two-way
    network performance. Unfortunately, however, standard IP performance measurement
    security mechanisms cannot be readily used with IPsec. This document makes the
    case for employing IPsec to protect the One-way and Two-Way Active Measurement
    Protocols (O/ TWAMP) and proposes a method which combines IKEv2 and O/TWAMP as
    defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively. This specification aims, on the
    one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be secured with the best mechanisms we have
    at our disposal today while, on the other hand, it facilitates the applicability
    of O/TWAMP to networks that have already deployed IPsec.</p>"
