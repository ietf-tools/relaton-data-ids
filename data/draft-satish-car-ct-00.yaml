abstract:
- content: "<p>Protocols being designed for seamless IP-level handovers, such as fast
    handover, context transfer (CT) and Candidate Access Router (CAR) discovery protocols
    will have to go hand in hand for any meaningful seamless handover implementation.
    The CAR discovery and subsequent Target Access Router (TAR) discovery is achieved
    through L3 QoS parameters, user preferences and application level QoS parameter
    match between the geographically adjacent access routers (GAAR). It is asserted
    in this draft that the primary consideration for fast handover and CAR discovery
    will still be layer 3 QoS parameters as supported by the ARs.</p>"
