abstract:
- content: "<p>The widespread adoption of DNSSEC implies more frequent DNSSEC failures.
    Unfortunately, DNSSEC's failure mode is largely opaque to the client: when validation
    fails, the only signal that the clients of a validating resolver receive is an
    empty response with a SERVFAIL response code. This note proposes a protocol extension
    to allow SERVFAIL responses to include additional diagnostic information, giving
    the client greater insight into what went wrong and a better chance of delivering
    useful problem reports to DNS operators.</p>"
