abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the motivation and requirements for supporting
    interactive network queries and data collection through a mechanism called Dynamic
    Network Probes (DNP). Network applications and OAM have various data requirements
    from the data plane. The unpredictable and interactive nature of the query for
    network data analytics asks for dynamic and on-demand data collection capabilities.
    As user programmable and configurable data plane is becoming a reality, it can
    be extended to support interactive query through DNPs. DNP supports node, path,
    and flow-based data preprocessing and collection. For example, in-situ OAM (iOAM)
    with user-defined flow-based data collection can be programmed and configured
    through DNP. DNPs serve as a building block of an integrated network data telemetry
    and analytics platform which involves the network data plane as an active component
    for user- defined data collection and preparation.</p>"
