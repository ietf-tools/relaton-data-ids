abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism along with extensions to [PWE3-
    CONTROL] draft that enable a PE to signal to the remote PE additional dynamic
    information about the pseudowire. This information may either be related to the
    operations of the pseudowire such as operational state of the Attachment circuit,
    the state of the pseudowire forwarders, the IP address and/or MAC address of the
    attached CE, or may affect the setup of the pseudowire, such as traffic engineering
    parameters, security related information, etc.</p>"
