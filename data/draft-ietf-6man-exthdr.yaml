abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate
    headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the transport-layer header.
    There are a small number of such extension headers currently defined. This document
    describes the issues that can arise when defining new extension headers and discusses
    the alternate extension mechanisms in IPv6. It also provides a common format for
    defining any new IPv6 extension headers, if they are needed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
