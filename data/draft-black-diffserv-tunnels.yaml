abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the interaction of Differentiated Services (diffserv)
    [RFC-2474, RFC-2475] with IP tunnels of various forms. The discussion of tunnels
    in the diffserv architecture [RFC-2475] has been found to provide insufficient
    guidance to tunnel designers and implementers. With the aim of providing such
    guidance, this document describes two conceptual models for the interaction of
    diffserv with IP tunnels and employs them to explore the resulting configurations
    and combinations of functionality. An important consideration is how and where
    diffserv traffic conditioning should be performed in the presence of tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation.
    A few simple mechanisms are also proposed that limit the complexity that tunnels
    would otherwise add to the diffserv traffic conditioning model; these mechanisms
    are also generally useful in situations where more general traffic conditioning
    is inappropriate or unavailable. Security considerations for IPsec tunnels place
    some limits on possible functionality in some circumstances. WARNING: The current
    status of this draft is highly preliminary; its major purpose is to foster discussion
    within the working group. Above and beyond the usual cautionary notice about not
    relying on Internet-Drafts, implementers are specifically warned that significant
    changes are expected to the contents of this draft.</p>"
