abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP authentication
    method with credentials that are not vulnerable to phishing attacks, and that
    does not require a server-side password database. The design can also be used
    in Javascript-based authentication embedded in HTML. HOBA is an alternative to
    HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords with all the negative attributes
    that come with password-based systems. HOBA can be integrated with account management
    and other applications running over HTTP and supports portability, so a user can
    associate more than one device or origin-bound key with the same service. We also
    describe a way in which the HOBA design can be used from a Javascript web client.
    When deployed, HOBA will be a drop-in replacement for password-based HTTP authentication
    or JavaScript authentication.</p>"
