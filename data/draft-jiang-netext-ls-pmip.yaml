abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility
    management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the numbers of MNs
    which attaching to the same MAG is very large, it will cause the problem that
    the arrival rate of data traffic is far surpass the process capacity of the MAG.
    So the MAG will suffer from process bottleneck. The IETF is working on optimization
    for PMIPv6. This document proposes a load sharing solution for MAGs by migrating
    the Picked Mobile Node (PMN) to some MAGs without overload to sharing the traffic
    load, which can relieve stress of the overloaded MAG and improve the performance
    of PMIPv6 network.</p>"
