abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes general security considerations for Reliable
    Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks and protocols. An emphasis is placed
    on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport protocol design. However,
    relevant security issues related to IP Multicast control-plane and other concerns
    not strictly within the scope of reliable transport protocol design are also discussed.
    The document also begins an exploration of approaches that could be embraced to
    mitigate these risks. The purpose of this document is to provide a consolidated
    security discussion and provide a basis for further discussions and potential
    resolution of any significant security issues that may exist in the current set
    of RMT standards.</p>"
