abstract:
- content: "<p>Differential Privacy (DP) is a property of a secure aggregation mechanism
    that ensures that no single input measurement significantly impacts the distribution
    of the aggregate result. This is a stronger property than what systems like the
    Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) are designed to achieve. This document
    describes a variety of DP mechansisms applicable to DAP, and, for a variety of
    common use cases, lifts DAP to a protocol that also achieves DP.</p>"
