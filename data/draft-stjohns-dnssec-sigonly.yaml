abstract:
- content: <p>Work on the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)( [RFC4033] et al) has been
    in progress for close to 15 years and DNSSEC is still not "mature" enough to be
    considered complete. A substantial issue is the complexity of the system. This
    document describes a simplified version of DNSSEC that can co-exist with the current
    protocols, but with characteristics such that the author believes it can be implemented
    and deployed with much less effort.</p>
