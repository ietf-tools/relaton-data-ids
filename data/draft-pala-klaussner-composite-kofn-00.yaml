abstract:
- content: "<p>With the need to evolve the cryptography used in today applications,
    devices, and networks, there might be many scenarios where the use of a single-key
    certificate is not sufficient. For example, there might be the need for migrating
    between two existing algorithms (e.g., from classic to post-quantum) or there
    might be the need to test the capabilities of devices via test drivers and/or
    non-standard algorithms. Differently from the situation where algorithms are not
    yet (or no more) trusted to be used by themselves, this document addresses the
    use of multiple keys and signatures that can be individually trusted to implement
    a generic 1-threshold and K-threshold signature validation procedures. This document
    provides the definition of a new type of multi- algorithm public key and relies
    on the definition of CompositePrivateKey, and CompositeSignature which are sequences
    of the respective structure for each component algorithm as defined in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs]
    and [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs].</p>"
