abstract:
- content: "<p>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to- Multipoint
    (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths. The existing
    specification for this functionality assumes that a downstream LSR selects only
    one upstream LSR for a P2MP or MP2MP LSP. A Make-Before-Break (MBB) procedure
    in mLdp base specification [MLDP] for graceful upstream LSR change but that is
    not applicable when the upstream LSR node fails. As IPTV deployments grow in number
    and size, service providers are looking for solutions that minimize the service
    disruption due to such failures. This document describes a set of procedures that
    minimize packet loss when an upstream LSR node fails. This document does not change
    any specifications of mLdp protocol as defined in [MLDP] and so there are no inter-operability
    requirements for the procedures described in this document.</p>"
