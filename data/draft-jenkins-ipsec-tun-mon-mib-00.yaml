abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines monitoring and status MIBs for specific applications
    of IPsec's security associations (SAs). The specific applications are for the
    purposes of virtual private networking (VPN) and secure remote access (SRA) applications.
    The MIB allows system administrators to determine operating conditions and perform
    system operational level monitoring of the VPN and SRA part of the network. Statistics
    and traps are provided as well.</p>"
