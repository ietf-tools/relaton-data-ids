abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) methodology can be used for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) to determine
    whether end-to-end communication is possible. ICE makes use of the Session Traversal
    Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol in addition to mechanisms for checking connectivity
    between peers. After running the ICE the two HIP end points will be able to communicate
    directly or through a relay via Network Address Translators (NATs), Network Address
    and Port Translators (NAPTs) and firewalls.</p>"
