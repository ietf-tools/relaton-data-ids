abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes a method whereby one can use GSS-API [RFC2078]
    to supply a public-key based secure channel between a client and a server without
    the need for an external Public Key Infrastructure for certificate verification.
    The method leverages the existing Simple Public Key Mechanism (SPKM), and is specified
    as two separate GSS-API mechanisms, SPKM-3 and LIPKEY, with LIPKEY layered above
    SPKM-3. SPKM-3 describes a method for creation of the secure channel using mutual
    authentication where both a user and server authenticate with public-key certificates
    [RFC3280]. SPKM-3 also describes a method for creation of the secure channel where
    only the server authenticates with a public-key certificate, and the user is anonymous.
    LIPKEY then uses the SPKM-3 anonymous secure channel to authenticate a user with
    a password, completing the mutual authentication.</p>"
