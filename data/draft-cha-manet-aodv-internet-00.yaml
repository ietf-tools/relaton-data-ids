abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we propose another solution to support Internet connectivity
    for AODV. In the design of our solution, several important limits of existing
    solutions are considered. Especially, new route determination and forwarding algorithms
    are proposed. Proposed route determination algorithm supports dynamic switching
    between default route and host route in a sender node through which enhanced performance
    can be achieved under frequent topological changes. And proposed forwarding algorithm
    supports next hop forwarding for default routes towards multiple gateways.</p>"
