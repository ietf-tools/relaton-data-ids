- content: "<p>This document lists logging capabilities originally identified in Operational
    Security Requirements for Large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP Network Infrastructure
    [RFC3871] and needed to support current operational practices, including those
    described in Operational Security Current Practices In Internet Service Provider
    Environments [RFC4778]. Logging is defined as the delivery of messages about the
    device, the data passing through the device, or the device's interaction with
    another device and has been traditionally provided via the syslog or SNMP protocols.</p>"
