abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to reduce unwanted traffic and make efficient use of limited
    access link capacity or other network resources, it is advantageous if customers
    can filter traffic destined to them, within their upstream Internet Service Provider
    (ISP) networks. The customer receiving traffic should have control over inbound
    filters, since their definition of desirable versus undesirable traffic may change
    over time (e.g. as new network services and protocols are introduced). In this
    document, we describe an SDN-based means for customers to express computable logic
    to their ISPs in order to distinguish between desirable and undesirable inbound
    traffic. These rules can be dynamically and securely updated within the running
    ISP network, with full automation One use case for this is in mitigating denial
    of service attacks. Even if such filtering is only implemented in an ISP's access
    network, it preserves capacity on the customer access links for desirable traffic.
    If implemented at the ISP's edge connections to other providers, or prior to ingress
    to their core, it can also preserve the ISP's own network capacity and other resources
    that may be threatened by attacks.</p>"
