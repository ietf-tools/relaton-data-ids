abstract:
- content: "<p>In MPLS-TP architecture, LSP and PW provisioning can be done either
    by Control Plane (CP) or Management Plane (MP). The MPLS-TP control plane must
    provide a mechanism for dynamic ownership transfer of the control of MPLS-TP transport
    paths from MP to CP and vice versa. [draft-bao-mpls-tp-path-transfer-reqs-00]
    defines requirement for MPLS-TP paths ownership transfer from MP to CP and vice
    versa. This document provides a framework to allow the development of protocol
    extensions to support the MPLS-TP paths ownership transfer between MP and CP and
    vice versa.</p>"
