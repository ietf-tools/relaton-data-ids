abstract:
- content: <p>The ability to compute constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Paths (TE LSPs) for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs in Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where a
    domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management
    or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems)
    has been identified as a key requirement [PCEP-P2MP-REQ]. This document addresses
    this requirement by extending backward recursive path computation (BRPC) technique
    proposed for Point-to-Point (P2P) LSPs in [P2P-BRPC] for P2MP LSP path computation
    in a multiple domains network. Conventions used in this document In examples,
    "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively. The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119 0.</p>
