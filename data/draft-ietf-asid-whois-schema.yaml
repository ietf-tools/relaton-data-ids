abstract:
- content: "<p>WHOIS++ is a simple Internet search and retrieval protocol, specified
    in [1], which allows clients and servers to exchange structured data objects known
    as templates. In the interests of interoperability it is desirable to have a common
    base schema for these templates. This document suggests a schema drawn from implementation
    and deployment experience to date with WHOIS++.</p>"
