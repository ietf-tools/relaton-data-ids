- content: "<p>Policy has long been accepted as means of bridging the gap between
    changing user requirements and static implementations. Policy management infrastructures
    provide abstractions of underlying services. In this way, applications can freely
    adapt to the needs and capabilities of changing environments. The policy approach
    has been especially successful in the deployment of security services.</p>"
