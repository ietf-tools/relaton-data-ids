abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow seamless IP
    multicast datagram delivery to mobile nodes in the Internet. In order to receive
    IP multicast datagrams, mobile nodes are not required to be identified by their
    unicast IP addresses. For unicast communication using Mobile IP, each mobile node
    needs to have a unicast home address and a care-of address. Following a handover
    to another IP subnet, such a mobile node is able to receive IP multicast traffic
    after exchanging IGMP messages with the multicast routers on the currently visiting
    network. However, in the worst case, it takes an unreasonably long time (especially
    with respect to streaming media) to resume receiving multicast IP traffic in the
    visiting network. This draft specifies a Mobility Support Agent (MSA) protocol
    which provides a mechanism to help ensure seamless reception of IP multicast traffic
    despite a mobile node handover. This is possible because in advance of its handover,
    a mobile node pre-registers with the MSA on the next network to be visited. The
    MSA acts as a proxy for this mobile node and is thus able to set up all the necessary
    states for the seamless delivery of multicast traffic to this mobile node.</p>"
