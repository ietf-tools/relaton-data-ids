abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 transition has been an ongoing process throughout the world
    due to the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space. However, this transition leads
    to costly end-to-end network upgrades and poses new challenges of managing a large
    number of devices with a variety of transitioning protocols. While IPv6 transition
    tools exist, there are still new issues exist. Operators may need various types
    of IPv6 transition technologies depending on performance requirements, deployment
    scenarios, etc. To address these difficulties, a software defined unifying approach
    would provide a unified way to deploy IPv6 in a cost-effective, flexible manner.
    This document describes use cases of IPv6 transition (Openv6) and also requirements
    in SUPA architecture.</p>"
