abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to fill in missing pieces necessary to
    enable an enterprise class storage network. One of the more important features
    of an enterprise class storage network is management; this document gives a framework
    MIB that will provide an integrated management environment for the enterprise
    customer. An enterprise class storage network is comprised of elements (i.e.,
    hubs, switches, converters, gateways, and HBAs) that are developed by many different
    vendors. The large number of vendors that can exist in a storage network makes
    mangement a very hard and complicated problem. The main goal of this document's
    MIB is to enable interoperability among the various vendors involved in the Fibre
    Channel marketplace.</p>"
