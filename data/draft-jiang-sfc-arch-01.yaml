abstract:
- content: "<p>As network virtualization is opening the gate to much more innovative
    services for service providers, Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a flexible
    way of service provisioning and facilitates their deployments. This document provides
    a general abstract architecture for service chaining. It is a flexible and scalable
    architecture which can fulfill requirements of SFC. Some solutions based on this
    architecture are also discussed and compared. This architecture can be used as
    a guideline and also a criterion for the design of SFC.</p>"
