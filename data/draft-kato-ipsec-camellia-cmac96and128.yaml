abstract:
- content: <p>This memo specifies two new algorithms for IPsec. One is the usage of
    Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) with the Camellia block cipher
    as an authentication mechanism in the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload and
    Authentication Header protocols. This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-96. The
    other algorithm is a pseudo-random function (PRF) based on CMAC with the Camellia
    block cipher for the Internet Key Exchange, version 2. This algorithm is called
    Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to
    IETF in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79. Internet-Drafts
