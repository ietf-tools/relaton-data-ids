abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new approach for realizing Ethernet line (E-Line)
    services over Segment Routing (SR) networks. This approach significantly improves
    scalability and convergence of control plane, and simplifies network operation.
    Furthermore, it naturally yields All-Active multi-homing support for E-Line services
    without relying on any overlay techniques.</p>"
