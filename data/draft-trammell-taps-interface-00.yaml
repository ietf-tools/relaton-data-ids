abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an abstract programming interface to the transport
    layer, following the Transport Services Architecture. It supports the asynchronous,
    atomic transmission of messages over transport protocols and network paths dynamically
    selected at runtime. It is intended to replace the traditional BSD sockets API
    as the lowest common denominator interface to the transport layer, in an environment
    where endpoints have multiple interfaces and potential transport protocols to
    select from.</p>"
