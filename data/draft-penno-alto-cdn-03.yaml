abstract:
- content: "<p>Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocol information
    about the underlying network topology from the ISP or Content Provider (henceforth
    referred as Provider) point of view. In other words, information about what a
    Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.
    The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences of network resources
    with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining
    or improving application performance. One of the main use cases of the ALTO Service
    is its integration with Content Delivery Networks (CDN). The purpose of this draft
    is twofold: first, to describe how ALTO can be used in existing and new CDNs,
    both within an ISP and in separate organizational entities from the ISP; second,
    to collect requirements for ALTO usage in CDNs and to provide recommendations
    into the development of the ALTO protocol for better support of CDNs.</p>"
