abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an *identity trust system*, which is a symmetric
    digital identity authentication system that requires no federation of authentication
    domains. The main components of the authentication process between two entities
    are: 1. *Symmetric authentication protocol* - Both entities must recognize each
    other and are authenticated by their identity provider according to a symmetric
    message exchange scheme. It builds on and extends the OAuth Authorization Framework
    RFC6749. 2. *Trustees network* - A special network dedicated to creating a protected
    environment for exchanging authentication messages between Identity Providers
    (IdPs) constitutes the infrastructure to avoid domain federation. 3. *Custodian
    concept* - IdPs are divided into two typologies to better protect personal data
    and link digital identity to physical one. A generic IdP (called trustee) to manage
    digital authentication only and a specific IdP (called custodian), with the legal
    right to process the individual's real data and under the control of country's
    authority, to manage the physical identity and the link with the digital one.</p>"
