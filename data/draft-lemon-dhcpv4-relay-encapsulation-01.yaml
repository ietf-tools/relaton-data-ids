abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a general mechanism whereby DHCP relay agents
    can encapsulate DHCP packets that they are forwarding in the direction of DHCP
    servers, and decapsulate packets that they they are forwarding toward DHCP clients,
    so that more than one relay agent can insert relay agent suboptions into the forwarding
    chain.</p>"
