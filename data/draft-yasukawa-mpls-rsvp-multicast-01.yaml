abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast technology will become increasingly important with the dissemination
    of new applications such as contents delivery services and video conferences,
    which require much more bandwidth and stricter QoS than conventional applications.
    From the service providers' perspective, traffic engineering (TE) functions will
    be needed to handle the large amount of multicast traffic. This document defines
    some protocol extensions to the existing RSVP- TE[1] in order to establish a multicast
    label switched path (LSP). The use of label switching routers (LSRs) with these
    protocol extensions defined in this document allows service providers to offer
    unicast and multicast multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) services in the same
    service network. This protocol assumes a variable LSP topology, e.g., point-to-
    multipoint, multipoint-to-multipoint, topologies. This document describes how
    to establish point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to- multipoint LSPs as the most
    basic multicast topology. It defines two ways of constructing a point-to-multipoint
    LSP: sender-initiated LSP setup and leaf-initiated LSP setup. Each method has
    an LSP modification function in order to adapt to dynamic changes in the LSP tree
    topology. This MPLS architecture[10] is very flexible and can be expanded to carry
    protocols other than IP multicasting, e.g., Ethernet, PPP, and SONET/SDH, but
    this document only defines IP multicasting (IPv4 and IPv6) as a forwarding equivalence
    class object (FEC).</p>"
