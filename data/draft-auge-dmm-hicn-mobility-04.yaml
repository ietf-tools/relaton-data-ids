abstract:
- content: "<p>This document first discusses the use of locators and identifiers in
    mobility management architectures, and their implication on various anchorless
    properties. A new architecture is then proposed that is purely based on identifiers,
    and more specifically names as defined in Hybrid-ICN (hICN). The document then
    focuses on two main cases: the end-point sends data (data producer) or the end-point
    receives data (data consumer). These two cases are taken into account entirely
    to provide anchorless mobility management in hICN.</p>"
