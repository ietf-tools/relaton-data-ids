abstract:
- content: "<p>PIM Flooding Mechanism is a generic PIM message exchange mechanism
    that allows multicast information to be exchanged between PIM routers hop-by-hop.
    One example is PIM Flooding Mechanism and Source Discovery which allows Last Hop
    Routers to learn about new sources using PFM messages, without the need of initial
    data registers, RPs or shared trees. This document defines a methodology that
    enhances forwarding efficiency in PFM deployments. This enhancement can avoid
    extra processing at PIM routers when PFM messages are forwarded.</p>"
