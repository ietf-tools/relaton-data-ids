abstract:
- content: "<p>In this informational draft, a simple TCP-level method to tackle unnecessarily
    inflated TCP retransmission timeout (RTO) value due to non-congestion losses over
    wireless uplink is evaluated. This method works between the handset and the intermediate
    node, and does not require the changes on legacy TCP implementations on wireline
    side. It uses one bit, named Kick (K) bit, from the TCP header to signal the handset
    or IN to override RTO. Also, this method does not undermine the congestion-control
    aspect of RTO exponential backoff.</p>"
