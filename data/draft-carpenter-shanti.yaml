abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a pragmatic need for a packet-level translation mechanism
    between IPv4 and IPv6, for scenarios where no other mode of IPv4 to IPv6 interworking
    is possible. The mechanism defined here uses a shim in both the translator and
    the IPv6 host to mitigate the problems introduced by stateless translation.</p>"
