abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC transport protocol is intended to be a general purpose transport,
    but is currently defined for client-server operation only. To be applicable to
    all use cases, it needs to develop support for peer-to-peer connection establishment.
    This memo describes how this can be done, in outline form. Future work is needed
    to determine if such peer-to-peer use of QUIC is desirable and, if so, to define
    a complete and workable standard for peer-to-peer QUIC connection establishment.</p>"
