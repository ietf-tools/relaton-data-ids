abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details some best practices for Application Service Providers
    who allow associations between a global DNS domain name and use case specific
    references using DNSSEC to provide a globally consistent, cryptographically verifiable
    association. Such a mechanism is needed when nonce-based domain control validation
    is not practical, such as use cases where each participant wants to confirm the
    association independently. As such, no single Application Service Provider exists
    to provide and validate a nonce to prove domain control that would satisfy other
    participating Application Service Providers.</p>"
