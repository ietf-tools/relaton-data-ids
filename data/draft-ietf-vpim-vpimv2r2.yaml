abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a restricted profile of the Internet multimedia
    messaging protocols for use between voice processing server platforms. The profile
    is referred to as the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) in this document.
    These platforms have historically been special-purpose computers and often do
    not have the same facilities normally associated with a traditional Internet Email-capable
    computer. As a result, VPIM also specifies additional functionality, as it is
    needed. This profile is intended to specify the minimum common set of features
    to allow interworking between conforming systems. This document obsoletes RFC
    2421 and describes version 2 of the profile with greater precision. No protocol
    changes were made in this revision. A list of changes from RFC 2421 are noted
    in Appendix F. Appendix A summarizes the protocol profiles of this version of
    VPIM. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
