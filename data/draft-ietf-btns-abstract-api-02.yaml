abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains in the abstract (no language bindings are provided)
    how an application may learn that IPsec has been applied to a conversation or
    specify that IPsec should be used. Though this is useful in general it is particularly
    useful for applications that wish to use BTNS (Better Than Nothing Security --
    a mode of IPsec keying), either in conjunction with channel binding or otherwise.</p>"
