abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the JSON Meta Application Protocol
    (JMAP) that allows clients to receive an object via the JMAP push channel whenever
    a new email is delivered that matches a client- defined filter. The object can
    also include properties from the email, to allow a user notification to be displayed
    without having to make a further request.</p>"
