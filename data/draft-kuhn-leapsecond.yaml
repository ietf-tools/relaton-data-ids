abstract:
- content: <p>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the international standard timescale
    used in many Internet protocols. UTC features occasional single-second adjustments,
    known as "leap seconds". These happen at the end of announced UTC days, in the
    form of either an extra second 23:59:60 or a missing second 23:59:59. Both events
    need special consideration in UTC-synchronized systems that represent time as
    a scalar value. This specification defines UTC-SLS, a minor variation of UTC that
    lacks leap seconds. Instead, UTC-SLS performs an equivalent "smooth" adjustment,
    during which the rate of the clock temporarily changes by 0.1% for 1000 seconds.
    UTC-SLS is a drop-in replacement for UTC. UTC-SLS can be generated from the same
    information as UTC. It can be used with any specification that refers to UTC but
    lacks provisions for leap seconds. UTC-SLS provides a robust and interoperable
    way for networked UTC- synchronized clocks to handle leap seconds. By providing
    UTC-SLS instead of UTC to applications, operating systems can free most application
    and protocol designers from any need to even know about UTC leap seconds.</p>
