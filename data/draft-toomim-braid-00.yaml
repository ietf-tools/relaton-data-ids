abstract:
- content: "<p>Braid is a proposal for a new version of HTTP that transforms it from
    a state *transfer* protocol into a state *synchronization* protocol. Braid puts
    the power of Operational Transform and CRDTs onto the web, improving network performance
    and robustness, and enabling peer-to-peer web applications. At the same time,
    Braid creates an open standard for the dynamic internal state of websites. Programmers
    can access state uniformly, whether local or on another website. This creates
    a separation of UI from State, and allows any user to edit or choose their own
    UI for any website's state. We have a working prototype of the Braid, and have
    deployed it with production websites. This memo describes the protocol, how it
    differs from prior versions of HTTP, and a plan to deploy it in a backwards-compatible
    way, where web developers can opt into the new synchronization features without
    breaking the rest of the web.</p>"
