abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the problem statement for the Interface to
    In-Network Computing Functions (I2ICF) for user services both on the network-level
    and application-level. In-Network Computing Functions (ICF) include In-Network
    Network Functions (INF) which are defined in the context of Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV) and Software- Defined Networking (SDN). ICFs also include
    In-Network Application Functions (IAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).
    Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to compose user services and consist
    of a combination of ICFs in a target network. This document investigates the need
    for a standard framework with the interfaces for ICFs, in terms of applications
    with the need to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the network and interoperability
    among multi-vendor ICFs.</p>"
