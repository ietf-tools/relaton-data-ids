abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP-TE [RFC3209] describes the use of standard RSVP [RFC2205] to establish
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As such, RSVP-TE inherited some properties of RSVP
    that adversely affect its control plane scalability. Specifically these properties
    are (a) reliance on periodic refreshes for state synchronization between RSVP
    neighbors and for recovery from lost RSVP messages, (b) reliance on refresh timeout
    for stale state cleanup, and (c) lack of any mechanisms by which a receiver of
    RSVP messages can apply back pressure to the sender(s) of these messages. Subsequent
    to [RFC2205] and [RFC3209] further enhancements to RSVP and RSVP-TE have been
    developed. In this document we describe how an implementation of RSVP-TE can use
    these enhancements to address the above mentioned properties to improve RSVP-TE
    control plane scalability.</p>"
