abstract:
- content: "<p>This document focuses on developing a key expansion method based on
    the internet X.509 public key infrastructure and elliptic curve cryptography,
    which is applied in the context of anonymous voting. The method enables end entities
    to maintain anonymity from other end entities, the registration authority, and
    the certificate authority, while still allowing the validity of end entity certificates
    to be verified, thereby facilitating anonymous voting services.</p>"
