abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a rough outline of a potential solution to IPv6
    multihoming in order to stimulate discussion. This proposed solution uses 126
    bit identifiers which are hashes of public keys (know as Cryptographically-based
    Identifiers) which are created in an autonomous fashion by every node. When there
    is a need to verify whether a new locator should be used with an identifier than
    a public-key based challenge-response is used. The proposal allows locator rewriting
    by (border) routers, and ensures that the upper layer protocols can operate unmodified
    in a multihomed setting using the stable identifiers.</p>"
