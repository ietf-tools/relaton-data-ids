abstract:
- content: "<p>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT
    or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server to differentiate
    between different clients. Such differentiation is valuable in several scenarios.
    This memo describes a technique to differentiate TCP and UDP clients sharing an
    IP address. The proposed method uses an ICMP Echo Request packet, which allows
    for more information about the user mapping to be transmitted than in the case
    of using the TCP option - and allows the use with UDP and other protocols.</p>"
