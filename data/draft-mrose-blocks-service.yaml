abstract:
- content: "<p>Blocks[1] is an architecture for managing metadata. The architecture
    supports two models: the Blocks exchange model organizes information into navigation
    spaces, whilst the Blocks convergence model allows for bulk synchronization and
    knowledge management. This memo describes how to provision a Blocks service. To
    subscribe to the Blocks discussion list, send e-mail[9]; there is also a developers'
    site[10].</p>"
