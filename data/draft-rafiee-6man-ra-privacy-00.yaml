abstract:
- content: "<p>Privacy is an important issue for many governments and users where
    its importance becomes more evident every day. Nodes might change their IP addresses
    frequently in order to avoid being tracked by attackers and which also results
    in the prevention of information being leaked from their nodes. In IPv6 networks
    there is currently one solution for maintaining privacy for nodes when IPv6 StateLess
    Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC-4662) is used. Unfortunately this solution,
    i.e., Privacy Extension (RFC-4941), has some problems, such as not generating
    a new Interface ID (IID) after changing the router prefix. The RFC also gives
    no explanation as to how to use CGA in its randomizing solution. The purpose of
    this document is to address these issues and to update the current RFC.</p>"
