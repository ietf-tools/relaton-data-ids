abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in
    RFC\n   8610, provides \"control operators\" as its main language extension\n
    \  point.\n\n   The present document defines a number of control operators that
    were\n   not yet ready at the time RFC 8610 was completed: .plus, .cat and\n   .det
    for the construction of constants, .abnf/.abnfb for including\n   ABNF (RFC 5234/RFC
    7405) in CDDL specifications, and .feature for\n   indicating the use of a non-basic
    feature in an instance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
