abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet draft outlines how transients in protocols such as OSPF
    [7] (intra-domain routing) and MPLS LDP [2] can lead to periods of time with loops
    and other undesirable routing phenomenon. It defines a set of metrics to quantify
    this dynamic behavior. Quantification of these metrics, using a simulation model,
    for various local vs. egress label allocation schemes is used as the basis of
    a comparative analysis. This includes quantifying any incremental impact that
    MPLS may have once it is introduced into an autonomous IP routing area. The resulting
    insights would help develop a better understanding of routing dynamics. This includes
    identifying key nodal and network variables which impact routing dynamics hence
    guiding MPLS feature selection and IP network design.</p>"
