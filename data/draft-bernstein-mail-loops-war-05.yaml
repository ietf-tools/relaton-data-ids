abstract:
- content: "<p>An automailer means any program that receives a mail message and automatically
    sends one or more mail messages. This term is meant to include not only a mail-based
    server, such as a mailing list exploder or a vacation program, but also an SMTP
    server, which receives a message from the network and relays it to a local or
    remote user. In a network full of automailers, any mistake can cause a mail loop.
    Since some automailers generate several outputs in response to a single input,
    a loop can produce an exponential explosion of mail. All the automailers in the
    qmail package follow a general philosophy designed to prevent mail loops and limit
    the damage from any loops that do occur. These automailers have been repeatedly
    observed to fail safe: they stop loops in the face of typical failures by other
    hosts. This document explains the philosophy and describes the automailers.</p>"
