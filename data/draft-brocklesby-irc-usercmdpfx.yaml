abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a method for a client to prefix commands sent to
    an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server with a label, in order to match server replies
    against commands previously sent, without having to keep excessive state on the
    server connection. It is a primary goal to implement this in a way which is completely
    backwards- compatible with existing IRC servers. This documents describes an extention
    to the Internet Relay Chat protocol as described in RFC 1459 [1].</p>"
