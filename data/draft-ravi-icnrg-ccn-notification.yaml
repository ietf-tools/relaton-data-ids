abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification for
    CCN. Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or multicast to multiple
    listening points. Notifications do not expect a Content Object response hence
    only requires the use of FIB state in the CCN forwarder. Emulating Notification
    as a PULL has performance and routing implications. The draft first discusses
    the design choices associated with using current Interest/Data abstraction for
    achieving push and challenges associated with them. We follow this by proposing
    a new fixed header primitive called Notification and a CCN message encoding using
    Content Object primitive to transport Notifications. This discussion are presented
    in the context of CCNx1.0 [1] proposal. The draft also provides discussions on
    various aspects related to notification such as flow and congestion control, routing
    and reliability considerations, and use case scenarios.</p>"
