abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes the typical usage and communication protocol
    of a client/server shared registry system for management of domain name registrations.
    The system described is a "thick registry" system, providing support for the storage
    and management of both the technical and the registrant contact information concerning
    domain registrations. The system relies on the existing HTTP and HTTPS infrastructure
    for transport and secure transfer to avoid having to implement a dedicated protocol
    and server environment. A bespoke XML format is used to communicate between clients
    and the SRS server. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the author:
