abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6-only provider networks, transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated
    in IPv6 is a common solution to the problem of IPv4 service continuity. A number
    of differing functional approaches have been developed for this, each having their
    own specific characteristics. As these approaches share a similar functional architecture
    and use the same data plane mechanisms, this memo specifies a DHCPv6 option whereby
    a single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and proposed approaches
    to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services by providing a prioritization
    mechanism.</p>"
