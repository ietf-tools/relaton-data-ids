abstract:
- content: "<p>The default method for IPv6 address generation uses two unique manufacturer
    IDs that are assigned by the IEEE Standards Association [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291)
    [RFC4291]. This means that a node will always have the same Interface ID (IID)
    whenever it connects to a new network. Because the node's IP address does not
    change, the node is vulnerable to privacy related attacks. To address this issue,
    there are currently two mechanisms in use to randomize the IID, Cryptographically
    Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem
    with the former approach is the computational cost involved for the IID generation.
    The problem with the latter approach is that it lacks security. This document
    offers a new algorithm for use in the generation of the IID while, at the same
    time, securing the node against some types of attack, such as IP spoofing. These
    attacks are prevented with the addition of a signature to the Neighbor Discovery
    messages (NDP).</p>"
