abstract:
- content: "<p>NMDA architectural framework eliminates the need to duplicate data
    structures to provide separate configuration and operational state sections and
    uses different datastores and new protocol operations to distinct configuration
    from operation state. However when non-NMDA clients communicate with NMDA aware
    server, it is not clear whether the NMDA aware server can use existing operation
    to return the same results with &lt;rpc-reply&gt; as non-NMDA-aware server does.
    This document identifies some of the major challenges, and provides solutions
    that are able to mitigate those challenges and smooth the migration towards NMDA
    deployment.</p>"
