abstract:
- content: "<p>For a class of gateways an activation of an uplink network connection,
    such as cellular radio connection, incurs a fixed cost in form of consumed energy.
    For these gateways minimizing the number of uplink activations is of importance.
    This specification describes an Optimal Transmission Window option for ICMPv6
    Router Advertisement that a gateway can use to communicate optimal transmission
    window for nodes it is serving, thus helping to group separate transmissions together
    and thereby reduce number of gateway's uplink connection activation events.</p>"
