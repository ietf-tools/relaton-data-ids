abstract:
- content: "<p>Voice &amp; Video over Internet have strict QoS requirements. Generally,
    low jitter, low delay and high bandwidth are the critical requirements for this
    class of applications. However, achieving this goal is difficult, more so in a
    wireless/internet environment, where the both networking &amp; communication channel
    conditions are dynamically changing over time. In this document, we propose a
    novel transport layer protocol that attempts to provide better QoS for multimedia
    applications. The purpose of the proposed technology is to act additively to existing
    QoS solutions at the lower protocol layers through enhancements to the SCTP protocol.</p>"
