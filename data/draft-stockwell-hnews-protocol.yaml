abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines HNEWS (HTTP News Protocol), an HTTP-tunneling
    news protocol. The NNTP(Network News Transfer Protocol) protocol described in
    RFC 977 is recast as HTTP CGI (Common Gateway Interface) requests that may be
    filled by any server that supports CGI. Two new commands are defined for connecting
    and disconnecting from an HNEWS server. Also, a mechanism for session state management
    is described. This document assumes that you have a working knowledge of the Common
    Gateway Interface [2] for running executable content on a web server and some
    familiarity with the NNTP news protocol [1]. A new URL scheme has also been specified
    for HNEWS and is described in a separate document [5].</p>"
