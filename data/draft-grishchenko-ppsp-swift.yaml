abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Multiparty Protocol (swift) is a peer-to-peer based transport
    protocol for content dissemination. It can be used for streaming on-demand and
    live video content, as well as conventional downloading. In swift, the clients
    consuming the content participate in the dissemination by forwarding the content
    to other clients via a mesh-like structure. It is a generic protocol which can
    run directly on top of UDP, TCP, HTTP or as a RTP profile. Features of swift are
    short time-till-playback and extensibility. Hence, it can use different mechanisms
    to prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized
    trackers or Distributed Hash Tables). Depending on the underlying transport protocol,
    swift can also use different congestion control algorithms, such as LEDBAT, and
    offer transparent NAT traversal. Finally, swift maintains only a small amount
    of state per peer and detects malicious modification of content. This documents
    describes swift and how it satisfies the requirements for the IETF Peer-to-Peer
    Streaming Protocol (PPSP) Working Group's peer protocol.</p>"
