abstract:
- content: "<p>Although QoS is identified as a very important requirement for L3 PPVPNs
    (see for example [PPVPN-REQ]), the proposed L3 PPVPN solutions ([2547bis], [VR],
    [CE-based]) have paid very little attention to describing how the proposed approach
    fulfills the QoS requirements. This document explores different points of view,
    describes dependencies and orthogonalities, and details a number of solutions
    and guidelines.</p>"
