abstract:
- content: '<p>The Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API)
    offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety
    of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document updates the Java bindings
    for the GSS-API that are specified in "Generic Security Service API Version 2:
    Java Bindings Update" (RFC 5653). This document obsoletes RFC 5653 by adding a
    new output token field to the GSSException class so that when the initSecContext
    or acceptSecContext methods of the GSSContext class fail, it has a chance to emit
    an error token that can be sent to the peer for debugging or informational purpose.
    The stream-based GSSContext methods are also removed in this version. The GSS-API
    is described at a language-independent conceptual level in "Generic Security Service
    Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1" (RFC 2743). The GSS-API allows
    a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights
    to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity
    on a per-message basis. Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are
    "The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM)" (RFC 2025) and "The Kerberos
    Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism:
    Version 2" (RFC 4121).</p>'
