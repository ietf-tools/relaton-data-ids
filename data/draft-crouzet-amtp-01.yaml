abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent years have seen electronic mail becomes the first mode of communication.
    Electronic mail allows users to exchange information using different formats such
    as files, pictures, videos and text messages. Electronic mail is quicker and faster
    than other modes of communication but it generates more problems, such as email
    bombing, email virus, email spoofing, anonymous email, relaying email and in particular
    spam email. This Internet Draft aims at solving or reducing the above problems
    by proposing a new transfer protocol, Authenticated Mail Transfer Protocol. Authenticated
    Mail Transfer Protocol is a second modified version of the current transfer protocol,
    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It identifies a sender, differentiates a server
    from a user, changes the electronic mail structure and improves the electronic
    mail transaction.</p>"
