- content: "<p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format is to define
    data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest with
    intrusion detection and response systems, and with the management sys- tems that
    may need to interact with them. This Internet-Draft describes a proposed data
    model to represent the information exported by the intrusion-detection systems,
    including the rationale for this model. This information is herein refered to
    as 'Alert', in accordance with the definition given in the IDWG requirements draft
    [1]. Examples are given to illustrate the use of the model.</p>"
