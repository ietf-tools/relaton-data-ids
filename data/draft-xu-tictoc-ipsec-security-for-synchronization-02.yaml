abstract:
- content: <p>Cellular networks often use Internet standard technologies to handle
    synchronization. This document defines an extension based on WESP. Usually, several
    traffic flows are carried in one IPsec tunnel, for some applications, such as,
    1588 or NTP, the packets need to be identified after IPsec encryption to handle
    specially. In order to achieve high scalability in implement, a separate IPsec
    tunnel will not be established for some special traffic. This document analyses
    the need for security methods for synchronization messages distributed over the
    Internet. This document also gives a solution on how to mark the synchronization
    message when IPSec is implemented in end to end frequency synchronization."</p>
