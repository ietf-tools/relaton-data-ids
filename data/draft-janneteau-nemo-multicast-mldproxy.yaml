abstract:
- content: <p>This document addresses the problem of delivering IPv6 multicast traffic
    to nodes inside a mobile network. An approach based on the deployment of "MLD-based
    Multicast Forwarding (MLD-proxying)" [1] in the mobile network, combined with
    the use of MLD [2][3] between the mobile router (MR) and the visited network,
    is proposed. Such a configuration allows multicast support for mobile networks,
    without the need to run a multicast routing protocol. In addition of being simple
    to implement and deploy, this approach provides global mobility in the Internet,
    and optimal multicast routing with nested mobile networks, while optimizing network
    and radio resources. This document does not specify new protocols, nor extensions
    to existing protocols.</p>
