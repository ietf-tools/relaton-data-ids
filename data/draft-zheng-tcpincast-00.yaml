abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an effective solution to the known TCP incast
    problem in data center networks. The incast problem refers to a drastic TCP throughput
    drop when the number of servers synchroni- cally sending data to the same receiver
    is too large. Our idea is avoiding packet losses before TCP incast happens. The
    scheme is limiting the number of concurrent senders such that the link can be
    filled as fully as possible but no packet losses. In this document we examine
    the condition that the link can be saturated but no packet losses. Then based
    on the condition we propose an approach to estimates the reasonable number of
    concurrent senders. Our approach does not modify TCP protocol itself and can thus
    be applied to any TCP variant, and works regardless of the type of data center
    network topology and throughput limitation. Analysis and simulation results show
    that our approach eliminates the incast problem and noticeably improves TCP throughput.</p>"
