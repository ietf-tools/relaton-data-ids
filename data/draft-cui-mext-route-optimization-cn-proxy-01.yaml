abstract:
- content: "<p>Route Optimization is a useful aspect of Mobile IPv6. In Route Optimization
    mode a Mobile Node (MN) can communicate with a Correspondent Node (CN) without
    the involvement of the MN's home agent. However, there are some limitations to
    this feature, including that the Mobile Node and the Correspondent Node must both
    be capable of Route Optimization. This document introduces a Route Optimization
    Proxy function that can be used to enable Route Optimization between an MN and
    an arbitrary other IP CN - the Route Optimization functions are delegated to the
    Proxy. The Route Optimization Proxy function may be implemented in the access
    router attached to the CN or any other node present on both the path from the
    MN to the CN and from the HA to the CN, and the Route Optimization Proxy can conduct
    RO-related signaling and accomplish the Route Optimization procedure on behalf
    of the Correspondent Node.</p>"
