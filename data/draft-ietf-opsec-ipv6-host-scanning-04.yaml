abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4 counterpart.
    An IPv6 subnet of size /64 can (in theory) accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19
    hosts, thus resulting in a much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than is
    typical in IPv4 networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or less unique addresses.
    As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous effort to perform
    address scanning attacks against IPv6 networks, and therefore brute-force IPv6
    address scanning attacks have been considered unfeasible. This document updates
    RFC 5157, which first discussed this assumption, by providing further analysis
    on how traditional address scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks, and exploring
    some additional techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance.
    In doing so, this document formally obsoletes RFC 5157.</p>"
