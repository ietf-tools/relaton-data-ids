abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a content-based multicast grouping framework
    aimed at simplifying routing control and reducing unnecessary traffic in large-scale
    networks for real-time spatial sensing and control applications. The framework
    introduces content-based multicast groups, which are managed at the local level
    by routers without the need for global group membership tracking. Additionally,
    a "topic" concept is introduced, allowing routers to manage multicast delivery
    based on data content. This framework reduces bandwidth consumption and simplifies
    multicast routing while offering flexible data delivery across various topics.</p>
