abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive
    resolver to use opportunistic encryption (that is, encryption with optional authentication)
    when communicating with authoritative servers. The motivating use case for this
    method is that more encryption on the Internet is better, and opportunistic encryption
    is better than no encryption at all. The method here is optional for both the
    recursive resolver and the authoritative server. Nothing in this method prevents
    use cases and methods that require authenticated encryption. IMPORTANT NOTE: This
    version of the document describes discovery whether an authoritative server supports
    encryption using port- checking. This restriction is based on the request of the
    DPRIVE WG during its meeting at IETF 109. It is quite likely that the final protocol
    will include a better set of methods for such discovery.</p>"
