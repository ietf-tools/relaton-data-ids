abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the DIAMETER Dial-up User Authentication Extension
    that is used for ROAMOPS [4] purposes. This specification was carefully designed
    to ease the burden of servers that must act as RADIUS/DIAMETER gateways, by re-using
    the same address space that RADIUS has defined [1]. Further, by re-using the same
    address space, it allows a single server to read the same dictiionary for both
    DIAMETER and RADIUS. This backward compatibility will hopefully facilitate deployment
    of DIAMETER.</p>"
