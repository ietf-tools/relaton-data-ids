abstract:
- content: "<p>Connecting an enterprise site to multiple ISPs using provider- assigned
    addresses is difficult without the use of some form of Network Address Translation
    (NAT). Much has been written on this topic over the last 10 to 15 years, but it
    still remains a problem without a clearly defined or widely implemented solution.
    Any multihoming solution without NAT requires hosts at the site to have addresses
    from each ISP and to select the egress ISP by selecting a source address for outgoing
    packets. It also requires routers at the site to take into account those source
    addresses when forwarding packets out towards the ISPs. This document attempts
    to define a complete solution to this problem. It covers the behavior of routers
    to forward traffic taking into account source address, and it covers the behavior
    of host to select appropriate source addresses. It also covers any possible role
    that routers might play in providing information to hosts to help them select
    appropriate source addresses. In the process of exploring potential solutions,
    this documents also makes explicit requirements for how the solution would be
    expected to behave from the perspective of an enterprise site network administrator.</p>"
