abstract:
- content: '<p>This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet
    electronic mail transport. It consolidates, updates, and clarifies several previous
    documents, making all or parts of most of them obsolete. It covers the SMTP extension
    mechanisms and best practices for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide
    details about particular extensions. Although SMTP was designed as a mail transport
    and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information that is important
    to its use as a "mail submission" protocol for "split-UA" (User Agent) mail reading
    systems and mobile environments. This document replaces the earlier version with
    the same title in RFC 5321. [[CREF1: Note in Draft: Except for the last sentence,
    the above is unchanged from 5321 and may need adjusting in the light of RFC 6409
    (Message Submission) as an Internet Standard.]]</p>'
