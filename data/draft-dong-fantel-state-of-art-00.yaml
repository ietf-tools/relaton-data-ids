abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of routing technologies that address
    the needs of traffic engineering and load balancing, with a focus on fast notification
    for example in adaptive routing. As the scale and complexity of networks grow,
    these technologies are becoming increasingly important when fault tolerance and
    rapid convergence are critical. The document explores existing solutions from
    both the IETF and the broader industry, highlighting their applicability to various
    use cases, including AI workloads and general services that demand low-latency
    fault recovery and dynamic load distribution across data center networks and inter
    data center. It also offers suggestions for potential IETF initiatives to further
    develop and standardize these techniques.</p>"
