abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework that elucidates various scheduling
    scenarios and identifies the entities involved in requesting scheduled changes
    of network resources or policy/action execution. It also addresses additional
    challenges such as conflict resolution, priority handling, and synchronization
    of scheduled tasks, ultimately enhancing the reliability and performance of network
    services. This document also describes the applicability of various network management
    tools and data models may be used, to meet the requirements of a set of representative
    use cases.</p>"
