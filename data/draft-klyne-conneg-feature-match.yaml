abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2533, 'A syntax for describing media feature sets', defines a format
    to express media feature sets that represent media handling capabilities. It also
    describes an algorithm for matching these feature sets, which may be used, for
    example, to determine whether the capabilities of a sender and receiver are compatible.
    This memo describes a revised form of the feature set matching algorithm, which
    incorporates lessons learned while implementing the original algorthm. It is anticipated
    that this revised algorithm description will be included in a future revision
    of RFC 2533. This memo does not affect any of the normative content of RFC 2533.</p>"
