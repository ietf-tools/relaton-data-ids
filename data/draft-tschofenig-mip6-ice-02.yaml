abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes how the Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) methodology can be used for Mobile IP to determine whether end-to-end communication
    is possible. ICE makes use of the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol
    in addition to mechanisms for checking connectivity between peers. After running
    the ICE the two MIP end points will be able to communicate directly or through
    a relay via Network Address Translators (NATs), Network Address and Port Translators
    (NAPTs) and firewalls. This document addresses also the problems raised in RFC
    4487 "Mobile IPv6 and Firewalls: Problem Statement".</p>'
