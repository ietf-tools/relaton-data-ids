abstract:
- content: "<p>SECSH defines an authentication mechanism that is based on public keys,
    but does not define any mechanism for key distribution. No common key management
    solution exists in current implementations. This document describes a protocol
    that can be used to configure public keys in an implementation-independent fashion,
    allowing client software to take on the burden of this configuration. This protocol
    is intended to be used from the Secure Shell Connection Protocol [4] as a subsystem,
    as described in Section ``Starting a Shell or a Command''. The subsystem name
    used with this protocol is The public-key subsystem provides a server-independent
    mechanism for clients to add public keys, remove public keys, and list the current
    public keys known by the server. Rights to manage public keys are specific and
    limited to the authenticated user. A public key may also be associated with a
    mandatory command.</p>"
