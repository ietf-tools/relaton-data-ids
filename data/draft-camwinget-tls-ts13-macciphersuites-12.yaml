abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the use of HMAC-only cipher suites for TLS 1.3,
    which provides server and optionally mutual authentication and data authenticity,
    but not data confidentiality. Cipher suites with these properties are not of general
    applicability, but there are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT)
    and constrained environments, that do not require confidentiality of exchanged
    messages while still requiring integrity protection, server authentication, and
    optional client authentication. This document gives examples of such use cases,
    with the caveat that prior to using these integrity-only cipher suites, a threat
    model for the situation at hand is needed, and a threat analysis must be performed
    within that model to determine whether the use of integrity-only cipher suites
    is appropriate. The approach described in this document is not endorsed by the
    IETF and does not have IETF consensus, but is presented here to enable interoperable
    implementation of a reduced security mechanism that provides authentication and
    message integrity without supporting confidentiality.</p>"
