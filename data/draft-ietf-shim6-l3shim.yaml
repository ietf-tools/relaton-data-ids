abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a particular approach to IPv6 multihoming. The
    approach is based on using a multihoming shim placed between the IP endpoint sublayer
    and the IP routing sublayer, and, at least initially, using routable IP locators
    as the identifiers visible above the shim layer. The approach does not introduce
    a "stack name" type of identifier, instead it ensures that all upper layer protocols
    can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting while still seeing a stable IPv6
    address. This document does not specify the mechanism for authenticating and authorizing
    the "rehoming" - this is specified in the HBA document. Nor does it specify the
    messages used to establish multihoming state. The document does not even specify
    the packet format used for the data packets. Instead it discusses the issue of
    receive side demultiplexing and the different tradeoffs. The resolution of this
    issue will affect the packet format for the data packets.</p>
