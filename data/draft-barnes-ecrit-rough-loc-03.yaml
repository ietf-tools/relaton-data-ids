abstract:
- content: "<p>Emergency calling works best when precise location is available for
    emergency call routing. However, there are situations in which a location provider
    is unable or unwilling to provide precise location, yet still wishes to enable
    subscribers to make emergency calls. This document describes the level of location
    accuracy that providers must provide to enable emergency call routing. In addition,
    we descibe how emergency services and non-emergency services can be invoked by
    an endpoint that does not have access to its precise location.</p>"
