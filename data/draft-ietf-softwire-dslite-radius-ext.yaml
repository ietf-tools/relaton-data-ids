abstract:
- content: "<p>Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
    to customers that are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix. Dual-Stack Lite requires
    pre-configuration of the Dual-Stack Lite Address Family Transition Router (AFTR)
    tunnel information on the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element. In many networks,
    the customer profile information may be stored in Authentication, Authorization,
    and Accounting (AAA) servers, while client configurations are mainly provided
    through the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This document specifies
    a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry the
    Dual-Stack Lite AFTR tunnel name; the RADIUS attribute is defined based on the
    equivalent DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME option. This RADIUS attribute is meant to be
    used between the RADIUS server and the Network Access Server (NAS); it is not
    intended to be used directly between the B4 element and the RADIUS server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
