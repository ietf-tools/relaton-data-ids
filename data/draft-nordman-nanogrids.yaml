abstract:
- content: "<p>A nanogrid is a very small electricity domain that is distinct from
    any other grid it is connected to in voltage, reliability, quality, or price.
    Nanogrids could form the basis of a future electricity system built on a bottom-up,
    decentralized, and distributed network model rather than the top-down centralized
    grid we have today in most parts of the world. This document introduces the idea
    of a nanogrid to the IETF community for two purposes -- to inform the work on
    energy management presently underway in the EMAN working group, and to describe
    how future communications within and between grids could be accomplished with
    protocols that are the product of the IETF. There appears to be no fundamental
    conflict between the nanogrid concept and the current drafts in the EMAN working
    group.</p>"
