abstract:
- content: "<p>Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) is a
    means of end-to-end protection of short request/response exchanges for tiny devices,
    typically transported using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). This
    document aims to assist implementers in leveraging the optimizations catered for
    by the combination of CoAP and OSCORE, and by generally providing experience from
    earlier implementations.</p>"
