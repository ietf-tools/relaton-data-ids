    in the header parameters of any COSE structure. This functionality helps to facilitate
    applications that wish to make use of CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in encrypted
    COSE structures and/or COSE structures featuring detached signatures, while having
    some of those claims be available before decryption and/or without inspecting
    the detached payload.</p>"
