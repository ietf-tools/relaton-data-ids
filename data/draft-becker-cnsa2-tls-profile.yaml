abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a base profile of TLS 1.3 for use with the U.S.
    Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a cybersecurity advisory
    published by the United States Government which outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic
    algorithm policy for U.S. national security applications. This profile applies
    to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of U.S. National
    Security Systems that employ TLS 1.3. It is also appropriate for all other U.S.
    Government systems that process high-value information. This profile is made publicly
    available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</p>"
