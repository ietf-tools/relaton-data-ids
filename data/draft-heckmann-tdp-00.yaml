abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a very flexible and efficient protocol for distributing
    price information (tariffs) inside an Internet Service Provider's management system
    and to its customers. It is designed to work with multiple QoS architectures,
    for example Intserv [2] and Diffserv [4]. It can also be used for dynamic pricing.
    It can use a number of different transport mechanisms, e.g. embedding tariff messages
    as policy objects in RSVP [9] messages. As tariffs can get very complex, it is
    possible but not necessary to send tariffs as code (e.g. Java). The draft also
    contains clear definitions of tariff and related terms.</p>"
