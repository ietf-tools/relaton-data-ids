abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents an IP address allocation scheme that enables the
    IP allocator (the organisation that allocates addresses) to postpone the final
    decision of prefix length by keeping space between allocated bits of the different
    parts of the IP address. This enables the allocator to change the different part
    lengths of the prefix (TLA, subTLA, SLA, ...) even after allocated spaces. This
    scheme is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 but is envisionned mainly for IPv6
    where the address space is larger and more flexible.</p>"
