abstract:
- content: "<p>The main use of NAT is to connect an existing internal network via
    an ISP to the Internet. The current NAT RFC1631 supposes that the network number
    used for the translation is not existing physically on any network. This does
    not work in some circumstances where the router connected to the ISP line is not
    under control of the user. This implies that the network where the NAT router
    is connected to, has the same network number than the one used by NAT.</p>"
