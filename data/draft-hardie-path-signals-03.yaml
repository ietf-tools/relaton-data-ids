abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path elements,
    contrasting implicit and explicit signals. For example, TCP's state mechanics
    uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear. Because
    these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting
    up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements.
    In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on- path network
    elements lack those signals. This document recommends that explict signals be
    used by transports which encrypt their state mechanics. It also recommends that
    a signal be exposed to the path only when the signal's originator intends that
    it be used by the network elements on the path.</p>"
