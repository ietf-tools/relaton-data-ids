abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents POP, a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) programming
    model for the Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF) network. POF is an SDN forwarding
    plane technology proposed by Huawei. A POF forwarding element (FE) does no need
    to understand the packet format, and can be programmed to support new forwarding
    protocols. POP enables user to define forwarding protocols and program the POF
    SDN network on the centralized control plane with algorithmic policies that are
    expressed with high-level programming languages.</p>"
