abstract:
- content: "<p>Roaming services allow users that have a contract with a voice service
    provider to use access resources owned by other providers known as internet access
    providers. This draft proposes a token- based Authentication, Authorization, Accounting
    (AAA) and billing model for roaming users supporting the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP). It also introduces a protocol solution for the proposed model that is based
    on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol and the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP).</p>"
