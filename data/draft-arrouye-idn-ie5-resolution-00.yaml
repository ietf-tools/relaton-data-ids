abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how internationalized domain names (IDNs) are
    being resolved in the Windows Internet Explorer (IE) Web browser version 5.0 and
    above. The resolution that is described in this document is currently available
    on a limited basis for an existing test bed. This document focuses on the different
    steps that are taken after a user enters an IDN in the address bar of IE, up to
    when the relevant Web page is displayed in the user's browser.</p>"
