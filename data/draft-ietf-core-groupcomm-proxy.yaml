abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operations performed by a proxy, when using
    the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group communication scenarios.
    Such a proxy processes a single request sent by a client over unicast, and distributes
    the request to a group of servers, e.g., over UDP/IP multicast as the defined
    default transport protocol. Then, the proxy collects the individual responses
    from those servers and relays those responses back to the client, in a way that
    allows the client to distinguish the responses and their origin servers through
    embedded addressing information. This document updates RFC7252 with respect to
    caching of response messages at proxies.</p>"
