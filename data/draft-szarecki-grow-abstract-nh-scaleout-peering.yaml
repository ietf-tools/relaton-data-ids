abstract:
- content: <p>Many large-scale service provider networks use some form of scale-out
    architecture at peering sites. In such an architecture, each participating Autonomous
    System (AS) deploys multiple independent Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs)
    for peering, and Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) load balancing is used between them.
    There are numerous benefits to this architecture, including but not limited to
    N+1 redundancy and the ability to flexibly increase capacity as needed. A cost
    of this architecture is an increase in the amount of state in both the control
    and data planes. This has negative consequences for network convergence time and
    scale. In this document we describe how to mitigate these negative consequences
    through configuration of the routing protocols, both BGP and IGP, to utilize what
    we term the "Abstract Next-Hop" (ANH). Use of ANH allows us to both reduce the
    number of BGP paths in the control plane and enable rapid path invalidation (hence,
    network convergence and traffic restoration). We require no new protocol features
    to achieve these benefits.</p>
