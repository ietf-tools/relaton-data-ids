abstract:
- content: "<p>moq-lite is designed to fanout live content from publishers to any
    number of subscribers across the internet. Liveliness is achieved by using QUIC
    to prioritize the most important content, potentially starving or dropping other
    content, to avoid head-of-line blocking while respecting encoding dependencies.
    While designed for media, it is an agnostic transport, allowing relays and CDNs
    to forward content without knowledge of codecs, containers, or encryption keys.</p>"
