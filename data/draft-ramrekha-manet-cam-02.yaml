abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generic Cognitive Adaptive Module (CAM) that
    can be utilized in conjunction with Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) routing protocols.
    The main concept behind CAM is the fact that the provisioning of multimedia communications
    traditionally requires routing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees [9]. Such a
    task is NP Complete in MANETs when QoS optimization is subject to more than one
    parameter [9]. Hence, the provisioning of soft QoS guarantees for effective and
    efficient routing in dynamic environments, as specified in [1], is the best alternative.
    However, the latter cannot be optimally achieved by using a single metric based
    path selection process or routing approach due to variations in both upper layer
    service QoS requirements and situational constraints. CAM provides interfaces
    to routing components such that protocols can be segmented into these components
    and can be easily made configurable and adaptive. For instance, the route selection
    process can be done in an adaptive manner to satisfy the requirements for effective
    and efficient routing. This is achieved by providing interfaces from the CAM core
    to various user defined components (e.g. Repositories Component) such that all
    components and component parts (e.g. DYMO reactive routing logic) can inter- communicate.</p>"
