abstract:
- content: "<p>Bump-in-the-Stack and Bump-in-the-API allow IPv4 applications to access
    IPv6 servers, using an in-host NAT46 translator. When used in conjunction with
    an in-network NAT64, it is also possible for the IPv4 application to access an
    IPv4 server via an IPv6-only network. This document describes how these functions
    work in detail, and discusses some concerns especially around IPv4 applications
    accessing IPv6 servers. These concerns can be reduced by not having IPv4 applications
    access IPv6 servers.</p>"
