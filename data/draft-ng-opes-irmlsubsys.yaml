abstract:
- content: "<p>The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based language
    that can be used to describe service-specific execution rules for network edge
    intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework, as described
    in [3] and [4]. This memo discusses the need for OPES framework to have different
    sub-systems in different deployment scenario, and proposes additions to IRML for
    a more flexible approach to supporting different sub-systems.</p>"
