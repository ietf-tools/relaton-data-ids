abstract:
- content: <p>The Start of Authority (SOA) Resource Record (RR) in the Domain Name
    System (DNS) specifies various parameters related to the handling of data in DNS
    zones. These parameters are variously used by authority- only servers, caching
    resolvers and DNS clients to guide them in the way that data contained within
    particular zones should be used. One particular field in the SOA RR is known as
    MNAME, which is used to specify the "Primary Master" server for a zone. This is
    the server to which Dynamic Updates are sent by clients. Many zones do not accept
    updates using the Dynamic Update mechanism, and any such DNS UPDATE messages which
    are received provide no usual purpose. For such zones it may be preferable not
    to receive updates from clients at all. This document proposes a convention by
    which a zone operator can signal to clients that a particular zone does not accept
    Dynamic Updates.</p>
