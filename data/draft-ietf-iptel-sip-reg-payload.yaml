abstract:
- content: "<p>Several newly developed languages and interfaces, such as the CPL and
    SIP CGI, allow users or administrators to specify how Internet telephony servers
    should process calls. There needs to be a method of transporting scripts for such
    languages between a client and a server. This document proposes using the payload
    of SIP REGISTER messages, and their responses, as one method to transport them.</p>"
