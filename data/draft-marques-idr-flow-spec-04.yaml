abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new BGP NLRI encoding format that can be used
    to distribute traffic flow specifications. This allows the routing system to propagate
    information regarding more-specific components of the traffic aggregate defined
    by an IP destination prefix. Additionally it defines two applications of that
    encoding format. One that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of
    traffic filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed)
    denial of service attacks. And a second application to traffic filtering in the
    context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service. The information is carried via the Border Gateway
    Protocol (BGP), thereby reusing protocol algorithms, operational experience and
    administrative processes such as inter-provider peering agreements.</p>"
