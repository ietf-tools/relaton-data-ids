abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the service token option in IPv6. The service
    token option expresses to the network the services that should be applied to a
    packet. The service token allows network infrastructure to map packets to a service
    class for processing in the network. The contents of service tokens are not globally
    defined, their meaning and semantics are defined for individual networks. Applications
    request service tokens from their network provider for the services they wish
    to be applied. The service tokens are sent in either Destination options or a
    Hop-By-Hop options IPv6.</p>"
