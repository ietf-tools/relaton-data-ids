abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Security Services API (GSS-API) provides a naming architecture
    that supports name-based authorization. GSS-API authenticates two named parties
    to each other. Names can be stored on access control lists (ACLs) to make authorization
    decisions. Advances in security mechanisms and the way implementers wish to use
    GSS-API require this model to be extended for the next version of GSS-API. As
    people move within an organization or change their names, the name authenticated
    by GSS-API may change. Using some sort of constant identifier would make ACLs
    more stable. Some mechanisms, such as public-key mechanisms, do not have a single
    name to be used across all environments. Other mechanisms, such as Kerberos, may
    include group membership or role information as part of authentication. This document
    motivates extensions to GSS-API naming and describes the extensions under discussion.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
