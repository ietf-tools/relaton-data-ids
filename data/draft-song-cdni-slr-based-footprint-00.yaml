abstract:
- content: "<p>Footprint advertisement is a very important step for CDN interconnection
    and generates a lot of discussion. Actually, each CDN can serve the whole world
    if its surrogates are publicly reachable by IP addresses. But if a CDN does that,
    it can not satisfy the requirements from the applications. So CDNs deliver contents
    for applications, and the basic requirements should be from the applications,
    but there is rare discussion on service level requirements based footprint. This
    document is used to generate the discussion on this aspect.</p>"
