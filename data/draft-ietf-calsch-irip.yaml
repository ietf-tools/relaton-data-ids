- content: "<p>This document specifies a binding from the iCalendar Transport-independent
    Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to a real-time transport. Calendaring entries
    defined by the iCalendar Object Model [ICAL] are composed using constructs from
    [RFC-2045], [RFC-2046], [RFC-2047], [RFC-2048] and [RFC-2049]. This document is
    based on the calendaring and scheduling model defined by [ICMS]. This document
    is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calendaring
    and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group. More information about the IETF CALSCH
    working group activities can be found on the IMC website at http://www.imc.org,
    the IETF website at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html. Refer
