abstract:
- content: "<p>Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack lite (GI-DS-lite) is a modified approach
    to the original Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) applicable to certain tunnel-based access
    architectures. GI-DS-lite extends existing access tunnels beyond the access gateway
    to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT using softwires with an embedded context identifier, that
    uniquely identifies the end-system the tunneled packets belong to. The access
    gateway determines which portion of the traffic requires NAT using local policies
    and sends/receives this portion to/from this softwire tunnel.</p>"
