abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines YANG modules to add support for classifying traffic
    received on interfaces as Ethernet/VLAN framed packets to sub-interfaces based
    on the fields available in the Ethernet/VLAN frame headers. These modules allow
    configuration of Layer 3 and Layer 2 sub-interfaces (e.g. L2VPN attachment circuits)
    that can interoperate with IETF based forwarding protocols; such as IP and L3VPN
    services; or L2VPN services like VPWS, VPLS, and EVPN. The sub-interfaces also
    interoperate with VLAN tagged traffic orginating from an IEEE 802.1Q compliant
    bridge. The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model in that the configuration
    is interface/sub-interface based as opposed to being based on membership of an
    802.1Q VLAN bridge. The YANG data models in this document conforms to the Network
    Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in RFC 8342.</p>"
