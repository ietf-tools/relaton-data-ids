abstract:
- content: "<p>In defining the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), some features
    have turned up that would be nice to have. In the interest of completing this
    specification in a timely manner, the present document was started to collect
    nice-to-have features that did not make it into the first RFC for CDDL, RFC 8610.
    It is now time to discuss thawing some of the concepts discussed here. A number
    of additional proposals have been added.</p>"
