abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 9370 specifies a framework that supports mulitple key encapsulation
    mechanisms (KEMs) in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) by allowing
    up to 7 layers of additiona KEMs employed with the oringal ECDH to derive the
    final shared secret keys for IPsec protocols. The primitive goal is to mitigate
    the security threat against quantum computers when additional post-quantum (PQ)
    KEMs are hybrided with the orinigal ECDH key exchange. This draft describes concretely
    how two specific QP KEMs, namely, ML-KEM and FrodoKEM, can be instantiated in
    the IKEv2 as the additional KEMs with the main ECDH to achieve hybrid key agreement.
    [EDNOTE: IANA KE code points for FrodoKEM may need to be assigned, when considering
    the code points for ML-KEM has been considered in [I-D.D24]. ]</p>"
