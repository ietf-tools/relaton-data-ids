abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7344 specifies how DNS trust can be maintained across key rollovers
    in-band between parent and child. This document elevates RFC 7344 from Informational
    to Standards Track. It also adds a method for initial trust setup and removal
    of a secure entry point. Changing a domain's DNSSEC status can be a complicated
    matter involving multiple unrelated parties. Some of these parties, such as the
    DNS operator, might not even be known by all the organizations involved. The inability
    to disable DNSSEC via in-band signaling is seen as a problem or liability that
    prevents some DNSSEC adoption at a large scale. This document adds a method for
    in-band signaling of these DNSSEC status changes. This document describes reasonable
    policies to ease deployment of the initial acceptance of new secure entry points
    (DS records). It is preferable that operators collaborate on the transfer or move
    of a domain. The best method is to perform a Key Signing Key (KSK) plus Zone Signing
    Key (ZSK) rollover. If that is not possible, the method using an unsigned intermediate
    state described in this document can be used to move the domain between two parties.
    This leaves the domain temporarily unsigned and vulnerable to DNS spoofing, but
    that is preferred over the alternative of validation failures due to a mismatched
    DS and DNSKEY record.</p>"
