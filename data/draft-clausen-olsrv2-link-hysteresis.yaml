abstract:
- content: "<p>Established links between MANET nodes should be as reliable as possible
    in order to avoid data packet loss. This implies that MANET nodes' link sensing
    should be robust against bursty loss or transient connectivity between nodes.
    Therefore, in order to enhance the robustness of link sensing mechanisms, additional
    link hysteresis strategies are used. This draft describes such a hysteresis mechanism
    for OLSRv2.</p>"
