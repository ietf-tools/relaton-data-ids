abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the problems that the Source Address Verification
    Architecture (SAVA) initiative plans to solve. It examines the current state in
    the internet, looks at current best practices, and discusses why the current approaches
    are unlikely to ever solve the problem of IP address spoofing. It also discusses
    some of the problems that SAVA should NOT attempt to solve.</p>"
