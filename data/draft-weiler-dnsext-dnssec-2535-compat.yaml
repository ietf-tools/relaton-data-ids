abstract:
- content: "<p>As the DNS Security (DNSSEC) specifications have evolved, the syntax
    and semantics of the DNSSEC resource records (RRs) have changed. Many deployed
    nameservers understand variants of these semantics. Dangerous interactions can
    occur when a resolver that understands an earlier version of these semantics queries
    an authoritative server that understands the new delegation signer semantics,
    including at least one failure scenario that will cause an unsecured zone to be
    unresolvable. This document proposes that these interactions be avoided by changing
    the type codes and mnemonics of the DNSSEC RRs (SIG, KEY, and NXT).</p>"
