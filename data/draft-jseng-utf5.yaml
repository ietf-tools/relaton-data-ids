abstract:
- content: "<p>A new transformation format, called UTF-5 for Unicode is proposed.
    The resulting string of this UTF is within a [A-V][0-9] alphanumeric range. This
    enables legacy systems or protocols designed for alpha- numerical character set
    only to be multilingual enabled and inter- nationalized immediately. Example of
    such systems are the domain name system and email addresses.</p>"
