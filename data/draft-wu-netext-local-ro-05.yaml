abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends local routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and
    defines a localized routing optimization protocol between Mobility Access Gateways
    within a single provider domain. The protocol supports operation over IPv4 transport
    networks, IPv4 home address mobility and handover. The Local mobility anchor initiated
    and mobile access gateway initiated local routing are allowed to setup local routing
    path between the mobile and correspondent node by sending messages to the corresponding
    mobile access gateway or local mobility anchor. If the MN &amp; CN are anchored
    with two different LMAs then the MN-LMA must discover which LMA the CN is registered
    with before an optimized local routing path can be established. Mobile Access
    Gateways create and refresh bindings using proxy binding update and acknowledgement
    messages.</p>"
