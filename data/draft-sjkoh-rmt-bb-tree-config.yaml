abstract:
- content: "<p>The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been chartered
    to standardize reliable multicast transport services and protocol instantiations,
    which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) protocol. This document is concerned
    with defining the building block for auto-configuration of the logical ACK-tree.
    According to the charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained modular component
    that is common to multiple protocols along with abstract APIs that define a building
    block's access methods and their arguments.' The TRACK BB mechanisms [5] will
    operate on the logical ACK-tree that is configured by this TREE BB in the TRACK
    PI sessions. This document is made based on the guidelines for the RMT BB [2]
    and the recommendations for TREE BB [4].</p>"
