abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) protocol, described
    in RFC 3720, allows for extension items to the protocol in the form of Private
    or Public Extension Keys. This document describes a Public Extension Key for the
    purpose of enhancing iSCSI supportability. The key accomplishes this objective
    by allowing iSCSI nodes to communicate architecture details during the iSCSI login
    sequence. The receiving node can then use this information for enhanced logging
    and support. This document updates RFC 3720 to allow iSCSI extension items to
    be defined by standards track RFCs and experimental RFCs in addition to informational
    RFCs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
