abstract:
- content: "<p>We consider looping issue of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Transient
    routing loops have been observed to form in Ad-hoc Networks running the MANET
    routing protocol with Link Layer Notification (LLN). Even when only a small quantity
    of the traffic may enter these loops and only for brief time, the effect is to
    significantly increase the impact on the surrounding network and its traffic thus
    degrading end-to-end transmission. The use of MANET routing protocols with LLN,
    together with loop detection and discarding of looping packet to negate the detrimental
    effects on surrounding traffic is found to improve performance significantly.</p>"
