abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents scenarios for information-centric networking
    (ICN) which can be used to establish a common understanding about potential experimental
    setups where different approaches can be tested and compared against each other.
    The scenarios are primarily based on published literature, that is, they have
    all been considered in one or more performance evaluation studies, which are already
    available to the community. The scenarios selected for inclusion in this first
    draft aim to exercise a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address. They
    include a) general aspects, such as, network efficiency, mobility support, multicast
    and caching performance, real-time communication efficacy, disruption and delay
    tolerance; and b) ICN-specific aspects, such as, information security and trust,
    persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.</p>"
