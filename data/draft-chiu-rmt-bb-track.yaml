abstract:
- content: "<p>The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been chartered
    to standardize reliable multicast transport services and protocol instantiations,
    which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) protocol. This document describes the
    RMT Building Block for Tree- based ACK (TRACK) mechanisms. It contains functions
    relating to positive acknowledgments and hierarchical tree construction and maintenance.
    It might primarily be used as part of the TRACK Protocol Instantiation. According
    to the charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained modular component that is
    common to multiple protocols along with abstract APIs that define a building block's
    access methods and their arguments.' The TRACK BB mechanisms will operate on the
    logical ACK-tree that is configured by the TREE BB [10] in the TRACK PI sessions.
    This document is made based on the guidelines for the RMT BB [5].</p>"
