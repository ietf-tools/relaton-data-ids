abstract:
- content: '<p>This document presents a taxonomy of "alternative network deployments",
    and a set of definitions and shared characteristics. This term includes a set
    of network models emerged in the last decades with the aim of bringing Internet
    connectivity to people, following topological, architectural and business models
    different from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the infrastructure
    connecting the households of the users, who pay for it. Several initiatives throughout
    the World have built large scale networks that use wireless technologies (including
    long distance) due to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum. Others
    rely on wired technologies. Some of these networks are self-organized and decentralized,
    other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of the users. The emergence
    of these networks can be motivated by different causes: Sometimes the reluctance,
    or the impossibility, of network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures
    to rural/remote areas. In these cases, the networks have self sustainable business
    models that provide more localised communication services as well as providing
    Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with traditional network
    operators. Some other times, they are built as a complement and an alternative
    to commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network operators. The
    classification considers different existing network models as e.g., community
    networks, open wireless services, user-extensible services, traditional local
    ISPs, new global ISPs, etc. Different criteria are used in order to build a classification
    as e.g., the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
    participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a community, a company
    or a local (public or private) stakeholder, etc. According to the developed taxonomy,
    a characterization of each kind of network is presented, in terms of network characteristics
    related to architecture, organization, etc.</p>'
