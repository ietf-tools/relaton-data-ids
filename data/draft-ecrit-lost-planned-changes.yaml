abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a
    planned change to the data in the LoST server to occur. Records that previously
    were valid will become invalid at a date in the future, and new locations will
    become valid after the date. The extension adds two elements to the &lt;findservice&gt;
    request: a URI to be used to inform the LIS that previously valid locations will
    be invalid after the planned change date, and add a date which requests the server
    to perform validation as of the date specified. It also adds an optional TTL element
    to the response, which informs all queriers the current expected lifetime of the
    validation.</p>"
