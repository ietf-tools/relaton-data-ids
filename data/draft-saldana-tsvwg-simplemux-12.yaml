abstract:
- content: <p>The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks results
    in a low efficiency, as the size of both the headers and the payload in these
    packets can be comparably large, often falling within the same order of magnitude.
    In some situations, multiplexing (i.e. aggregating) a number of small packets
    into a bigger one is desirable to improve the efficiency. For example, a number
    of small packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if they share
    a common network path. This may happen between machines in different locations
    or even inside a datacenter with a number of servers hosting virtual machines.
    The traffic profile can be shifted from small to larger packets, thus reducing
    the network overhead and the number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate
    devices. This document describes Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a number
    of packets belonging to different protocols into a single packet. Small headers
    (separators) are added at the beginning of each multiplexed packet, including
    some flags, the packet length and a "Protocol" field. The presence of this "Protocol"
    field allows it to aggregate packets belonging to any protocol (the "multiplexed
    packets"), in a single packet belonging to other (or the same) protocol (the "tunneling
    protocol"). To reduce the overhead, the size of the multiplexing headers is kept
    very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing packets of small size).</p>
