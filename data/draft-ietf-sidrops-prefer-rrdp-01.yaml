abstract:
- content: "<p>This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a state where
    RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI Validation will use
    the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) [RFC8182] as the preferred access protocol,
    and require rsync as a fallback option only. In phase 0, today's deployment, RRDP
    is supported by most, but not all Repositories, and most but not all RP software.
    In the proposed phase 1 RRDP will become mandatory to implement for Repositories,
    in addition to rsync. This phase can start as soon as this document is published.
    Phase 2 will start once the proposed updates are implemented by all compliant
    Repositories. In this phase RRDP will become mandatory to implement for all compliant
    RP software, and rsync will be required as a fallback option only. It should be
    noted that although this document currently includes descriptions and updates
    to RFCs for each of these phases, we may find that it will be beneficial to have
    one or more separate documents for these phases, so that it might be more clear
    to all when the updates to RFCs take effect.</p>"
