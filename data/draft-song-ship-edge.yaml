abstract:
- content: "<p>To mitigate the IPv6 header overhead and improve the scalability and
    performance in edge networks, this draft proposes to use short hierarchical IP
    addresses excluding the network prefix within edge networks. An edge network can
    be further organized into a hierarchical architecture containing one or more levels
    of networks. While each end node only needs to keep a short address suffix as
    its identifier, the border routers for each hierarchical level are responsible
    for address augmenting and pruning when a packet leaves or enter a lower level
    network. Specifically, the top-level border routers of an edge network convert
    the internal IP header to and from the standard IPv6 header. This draft presents
    an incrementally deployable scheme allowing packet header to be effectively compressed
    in edge networks without affecting the network interoperability. Simplifying both
    network data plane and control plane, the SHIP architecture is suitable for any
    types of edge networks, especially when low latency, high performance, and high
    bandwidth efficiency are required.</p>"
