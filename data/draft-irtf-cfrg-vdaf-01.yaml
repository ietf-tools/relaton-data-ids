abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions
    (VDAFs), a family of multi-party protocols for computing aggregate statistics
    over user measurements. These protocols are designed to ensure that, as long as
    at least one aggregation server executes the protocol honestly, individual measurements
    are never seen by any server in the clear. At the same time, VDAFs allow the servers
    to detect if a malicious or misconfigured client submitted an input that would
    result in an incorrect aggregate result.</p>"
