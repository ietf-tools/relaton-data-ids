abstract:
- content: "<p>A separate document [I-D:draft-taddei-smart-cless-introduction] (CLESS)
    attempts to establish the capabilities and limitations of endpoint-only security
    solutions and explore potential alternative approaches. That document discusses
    endpoints in general terms. It has been suggested that there are classes of endpoints
    that have different characteristics. Those classes may have completely different
    threat landscapes and the endpoints may have completely different security capabilities.
    In support of the work on CLESS, this document provides a taxonomy of endpoints
    that is intended to provide a foundation for further work on CLESS and research
    on approaches to providing endpoint security alternatives in a diverse group of
    settings.</p>"
