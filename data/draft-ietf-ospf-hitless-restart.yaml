abstract:
- content: <p>This memo documents an enhancement to the OSPF routing protocol, whereby
    an OSPF router can stay on the forwarding path even as its OSPF software is restarted.
    This is called "graceful restart" or "non-stop forwarding". A restarting router
    may not be capable of adjusting its forwarding in a timely manner when the network
    topology changes. In order to avoid the possible resulting routing loops, the
    procedure in this memo automatically reverts to a normal OSPF restart when such
    a topology change is detected, or when one or more of the restarting router's
    neighbors do not support the enhancements in this memo. Proper network operation
    during a graceful restart makes assumptions upon the operating environment of
    the restarting router; these assumptions are also documented.</p>
