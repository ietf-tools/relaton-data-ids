abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to serve as input to the discussion in the
    Mobile IP Working Group regarding securing MIPv6 Binding Updates. This document
    tries to capture a possible extreme point in the design space for a solution to
    that problem, for the purposes of exploring the design space. The author does
    not claim that this protocol is better than any other proposed solutions - merely
    that it is different and the differences can help in understanding design tradeoffs
    in this space.</p>"
