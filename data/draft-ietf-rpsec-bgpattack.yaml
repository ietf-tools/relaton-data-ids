abstract:
- content: <p>This I-D presents all known attack vectors into or using BGP. The data
    is presented in "Attack Tree" format as published by Schneier [ATTACKTREE] and
    detailed by the CERT in "Attack Modeling for Information Security and Survivability"
    [MODELING]. Future security improvements to BGP (whether best practices or enhancements
    to the protocol) should consider the attacks outlined here when determining the
    relative security improvements such changes provide.</p>
