abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses enhancements to the Bi-directional Edge Tunnel
    Handover for IPv6 protocol described in draft-kempf-beth-ipv6-02.txt. Such draft
    proposes the use of bi-directional edge tunnels and deferred Care of Address establishment
    to eliminate L3 signaling during handover, thereby achieving a rapid and efficient
    handover mechanism. The proposal in the present draft offers some improvements
    to the draft-kempf-beth-ipv6-02.txt in several respects.</p>"
