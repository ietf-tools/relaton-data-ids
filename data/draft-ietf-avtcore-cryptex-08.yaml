abstract:
- content: "<p>While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides confidentiality
    for the contents of a media packet, a significant amount of metadata is left unprotected,
    including RTP header extensions and contributing sources (CSRCs). However, this
    data can be moderately sensitive in many applications. While there have been previous
    attempts to protect this data, they have had limited deployment, due to complexity
    as well as technical limitations. This document updates RFC 3711, the SRTP specification,
    and defines Cryptex as a new mechanism that completely encrypts header extensions
    and CSRCs and uses simpler Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling with the
    goal of facilitating deployment.</p>"
