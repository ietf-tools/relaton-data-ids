abstract:
- content: "<p>The need for high quality routing for Low power and Lossy Network (L2N)
    such as sensor networks comprised of highly constrained devices (CPU, memory,...)
    in sometimes unstable wireless environments is critical now and will continue
    to increase. Interest in this class of applications has grown dramatically in
    recent years and a routing solution addressing the specific environments of such
    networks is highly required considering the numerous, incompatible open-source
    and proprietary routing protocols as well as several industrial forums. The aim
    of this document is to define the routing requirements for Sensor Networks at
    the IP layer. Such routing protocol(s) would need to address several unique aspects
    of this class of embedded devices and would operate in networks comprising links
    of various nature.</p>"
