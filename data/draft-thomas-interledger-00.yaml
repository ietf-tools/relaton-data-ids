abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Interledger Protocol (ILP). It draws heavily
    from the definition of the Internet Protocol (IP) defined in [RFC0791]. The interledger
    protocol is the culmination of more than a decade of research in decentralized
    payment protocols. This work was started in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, augmented by
    the development of Bitcoin in 2008 and has involved numerous contributors since
    then. Feedback This specification is a part of the Interledger Project [1] work.
    Feedback related to this specification should be sent to public- interledger@w3.org
    [2].</p>"
