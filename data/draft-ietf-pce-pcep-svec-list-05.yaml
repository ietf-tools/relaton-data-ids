abstract:
- content: "<p>A Path Computation Element (PCE) may be required to perform dependent
    path computations. Dependent path computations are requests that need to be synchronized
    in order to meet specific objectives. An example of a dependent request would
    be a PCE computing a set of services that are required to be diverse (disjointed)
    from each other. When a PCE computes sets of dependent path computation requests
    concurrently, use of the Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) list is required for association
    among the sets of dependent path computation requests. The SVEC object is optional
    and carried within the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    PCRequest (PCReq) message. This document does not specify the PCEP SVEC object
    or procedure. This informational document clarifies the use of the SVEC list for
    synchronized path computations when computing dependent requests. The document
    also describes a number of usage scenarios for SVEC lists within single-domain
    and multi-domain environments. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
