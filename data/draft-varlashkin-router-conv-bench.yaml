abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies methodology for benchmarking convergence of
    routers without making assumptions about relation and dependencies between data-
    and control-planes. Provided methodology is primary intended for testing routers
    running BGP and some form of link-state IGP with or without MPLS. It may also
    be applicable for environments using MPLS-TE or GRE, however they're beyond scope
    of this document and such application is left for further study.</p>"
