abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements and a proposed solution for
    an SDP Offer/Answer exchange model for negotiating best-effort SRTP keys, i.e.,
    in a backward-compatible manner with non-SRTP devices. The proposed solution is
    a trivial interpretation of the usage of the profile and the usage of SDP indication
    of [sdesc] and [kmgmt].</p>"
