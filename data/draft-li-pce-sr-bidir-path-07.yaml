abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for
    computing paths in Segment Routing (SR) TE networks. This document defines PCEP
    extensions for grouping two reverse unidirectional SR Paths into an Associated
    Bidirectional SR Path when using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated
    LSPs as well as when using a Stateless PCE.</p>"
