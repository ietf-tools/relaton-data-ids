abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records.
    DNS64 is used with NAT64, an IPv6 IPv4 translator to enable client- server communication
    between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server, without requiring any changes
    to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node, for the class of applications that work through
    NATs. This document specifies DNS64, and provides suggestions on how it should
    be deployed in conjunction with NAT64.</p>"
