abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) is a popular forwarding paradigm for use in MPLS
    and IPv6 networks. It is typically deployed in discrete domains that may be data
    centers, access networks, or other networks that are under the control of a single
    operator and that can easily be upgraded to support this new technology. Traffic
    originating in one SR domain often terminates in another SR domain but must transit
    a backbone network that provides interconnection between those domains. This document
    describes a mechanism for providing connectivity between SR domains to enable
    end-to-end or domain-to-domain traffic engineering. The approach described allows
    connectivity between SR domains, utilizes traffic engineering mechanisms (RSVP-TE
    or Segment Routing) across the backbone network, makes heavy use of pre-existing
    technologies, and requires the specification of very few additional mechanisms.
    This document provides some background and a problem statement, explains the solution
    mechanism, gives references to other documents that define protocol mechanisms,
    and provides examples. It does not define any new protocol mechanisms.</p>"
