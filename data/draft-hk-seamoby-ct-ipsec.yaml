abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a large number of IP access networks where one may wish to
    provide security for end user traffic, or secure the access network from unauthorized
    traffic. One protocol which may be used to provide these services is IPSec, which
    requires a node to establish a security association with the access network in
    order to obtain these services. Traditionally, such an association is considered
    static, however, there are many situations in which the ability to move an IPSec
    security association (SA) from one security gateway (SG) to another within the
    access network may be beneficial. Examples of this include IPSec handover in mobile
    LANs and PANs, load-balancing between IPSec SGs, and fail-over applications where
    high-availability is required.</p>"
