abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft we address some of the key discussion points related
    to the scope of Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD). Specifically, we
    show how we can define the middlebox communication framework such that it allows
    uneven resource sharing on the path among the endpoints enhancing in this way
    the user experience. Issues related to trust and incentives as well as how to
    support user decisions in this eco-system are clarified.</p>"
