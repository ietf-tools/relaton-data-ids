abstract:
- content: <p>The security and robustness of the Domain Name System (DNS) significantly
    depend on how resolvers handle received responses. Current DNS specifications
    lack exhaustive and consistent guidance on response pre-processing, particularly
    for malformed or unexpected packets. This specification gap has led to implementation
    divergences and has been shown to introduce security vulnerabilities such as DNS
    cache poisoning, Denial of Service (DoS), and resource exhaustion, as detailed
    in the TUDOOR attack research. This document aims to clarify and standardize the
    behavior of DNS resolvers when receiving and initially processing responses from
    upstream servers. The core proposal is the "Awaiting Valid Responses" mechanism,
    which mandates that a resolver, after issuing a query, MUST maintain a defined
    waiting period to receive a well- formed, relevant, and validated response. During
    this period, non- compliant incoming packets should be discarded, and the resolver
    should continue to wait until a valid response is received or the query times
    out. This document provides guidance for DNS implementers to mitigate security
    risks arising from flaws in response pre-processing logic.</p>
