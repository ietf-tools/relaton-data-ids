abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a
    piece of software, and conveying that delegation to the software. This delegation
    can include access to a set of APIs as well as information passed directly to
    the software. This document has been prepared by the GNAP working group design
    team of Kathleen Moriarty, Fabien Imbault, Dick Hardt, Mike Jones, and Justin
    Richer. This document is intended as a starting point for the working group and
    includes decision points for discussion and agreement. Many of the features in
    this proposed protocol can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where possible,
    the editor has included notes and discussion from the design team regarding the
    options as understood.</p>"
