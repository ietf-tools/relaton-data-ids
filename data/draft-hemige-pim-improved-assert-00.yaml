abstract:
- content: "<p>In [PIM-SM], assert procedures are triggered by data-plane interaction
    with the control-plane when traffic arrives on an outgoing interface. There are
    several disadvantages with this in that duplicate traffic is forwarded downstream
    until an assert winner is elected and seen by all routers on the LAN; such dependence
    on the data-plane to build control-plane state does not scale well. When [PIM-SM]
    is used to setup P2MP LSP trees as in [SURESH-P2MP], it is not always possible
    to determine if traffic arrived on an outbound interface. This draft proposes
    mechanisms to trigger assert completely in the control plane by reacting to Joins
    sent to another router on a LAN. These procedures are essential when it is not
    possible to determine if traffic arrived on an outbound interface. It also helps
    completely remove the dependency on data-plane to trigger asserts and eliminates
    duplicate traffic resulting from assert scenarios.</p>"
