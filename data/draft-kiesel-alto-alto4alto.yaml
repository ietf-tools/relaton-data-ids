abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set
    of candidates that are able to provide a desired resource. Entities seeking guidance
    need to discover and possibly select an ALTO server to ask. This document proposes
    an ALTO-based scheme to select an ALTO server that can give guidance to a given
    ALTO client. Unlike some other proposed ALTO discovery mechanisms, this solution
    works well if the client seeks guidance from a set of ALTO servers that are operated
    by an entity which is not the operator of the access network.</p>"
