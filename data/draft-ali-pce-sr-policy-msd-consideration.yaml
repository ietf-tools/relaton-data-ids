abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any
    path. SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e., instructions) that represent
    a source-routed policy. The packets steered into an SR Policy carry an ordered
    list of segments associated with that SR Policy. An SR Policy can be instantiated
    SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes. Maximum SID Depth (MSD) specifies the maximum number
    of SIDs that a Path Computation Client (PCC) is capable of imposing on a packet.
    The number of SIDs in an SR-TE path computed by the PCE on behalf of a PCC is
    dictated by the MSD value at the PCC. This draft specifies some MSD considerations
    PCE needs to take into account when computing the number of SIDs in an SR-TE path.</p>"
