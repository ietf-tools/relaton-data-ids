abstract:
- content: "<p>Designing a routing protocol for large low-power and lossy networks
    (LLNs), consisting of thousands of constrained nodes and unreliable links, presents
    new challenges. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low- power and Lossy Networks (RPL),
    have been developed by the IETF ROLL Working Group as a preferred routing protocol
    to provide IPv6 routing functionality in LLNs. Unfortunately, the currently available
    security services in RPL will not protect against a compromised internal node
    that can construct and disseminate fake messages. Therefore, in RPL special security
    care must be taken when the Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG)
    root is updating the Version Number by which reconstruction of the routing topology
    can be initiated. The same care also must be taken to prevent an internal attacker
    (compromised DODAG node) to publish decreased Rank value, which causes a large
    part of the DODAG to connect to the DODAG root via the attacker and give it the
    ability to eavesdrop or manipulate a large part of the network traffic. In this
    document, a new security service is described that prevents any misbehaving DODAG
    node from illegitimately increasing the Version Number or publish illegitimately
    decreased Rank values.</p>"
