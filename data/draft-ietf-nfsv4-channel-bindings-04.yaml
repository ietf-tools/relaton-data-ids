abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines and formalizes the concept of channel bindings
    to secure layers and defines the channel bindings for several types of secure
    channels. The concept of channel bindings allows applications to prove that the
    end-points of two secure channels at different network layers are the same by
    binding authentication at one channel to the session protection at the other channel.
    The use of channel bindings allows applications to delegate session protection
    to lower layers, which may significantly improve performance for some applications.</p>"
