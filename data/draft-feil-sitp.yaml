abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Security Information Transfer Protocol (SITP)
    used to send and receive security information between systems in a TCP/IP network.
    An initiator can use SITP to request audit, discretionary access control lists,
    and other data from a responder. The responder handles the request and sets parameters
    or returns the requested data. SITP has been adopted by the Trusted System Interoperability
    Group as the protocol of choice for audit management.</p>"
