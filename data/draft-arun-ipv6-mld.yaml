abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an optimization for MLDv1 (RFC 2710) and MLDv2
    (RFC 3810). As per this optimization, a new router on coming up will not send
    periodic "General Query" messages to get the list of multicast listeners. Instead,
    it will try to get the same from the Querier on the link. Only if no Querier are
    present on the link, will the new router move to Querier state and send "General
    Query" messages. This approach provides an advantage in eliminating possibly large
    number of "Multicast Listener Report" messages every time a new router comes up
    on a link. More the number of listeners on a link, more the advantage.</p>
