abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft aims at describing a wide spread set of possible
    connectivity scenarios involving mobile ad-hoc networks, in order to provide reference
    for standardization effort in this field. The aspects considered for definition
    and classification of the scenarios are number and characteristics of the gateways
    that connect MANET nodes to external networks. Analysis will range from a scenario
    where no connectivity is provided, i.e. an isolated MANET, to more complex scenario
    where a MANET has multiple mobile Gateways.</p>"
