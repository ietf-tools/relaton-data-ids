abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes enhancements to the Segment Routing (SR) Flexible
    Algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework by integrating power consumption metrics into
    routing decisions. It introduces metrics encompassing both node-level and link-level
    energy consumption attributes and proposes dynamic energy-aware path computation.
    By incorporating these metrics alongside traditional routing parameters, the enhanced
    Flex-Algo framework can enable networks to optimize routing paths for energy efficiency,
    and then leverage on advances router capabilities to further reduce operational
    costs as well as supporting sustainability objectives.</p>"
