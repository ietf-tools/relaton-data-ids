abstract:
- content: "<p>With the depletion of the IPv4 address space, large-scale SPs are now
    faced with the real option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner. In order to achieve
    smooth transition to IPv6, migration tools should be introduced for different
    deployment models. Among different IPv6 transition mechanisms, MAP-T is a stateless
    translation method which can directly translate IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet. This
    document describes the challenges and requirements for large SP to deploy IPv6
    in operational network, the experimental results of MAP-T in our laboratory and
    the field trials in large SP operational network.</p>"
