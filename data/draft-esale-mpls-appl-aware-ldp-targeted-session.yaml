abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent Targeted LDP applications such as Remote LFA and BGP auto discovery
    FEC 129 pseudowire may automatically establish a targeted LDP session to any LSR
    in the core network. The sender LSR has information about the targeted applications
    to administratively control initiation of the session. However the receiver LSR
    has no such information to control the acceptance of this session. This document
    defines a mechanism to advertise Targeted Application Capability during session
    initialization. As the receiver LSR becomes aware of targeted LDP applications,
    it may establish a limited number of sessions for certain applications. In addition,
    each targeted application is mapped to LDP FEC Elements to advertise only necessary
    LDP FEC label bindings over the session.</p>"
