abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is derived from artificial intelligence (AI) network
    and autonomous security, network management intend-based technology to ensure
    constant security quality in B5G. SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and
    Response) is needed by autonomous security and network management to optimize
    an adaptive B5G network. The purpose of this document is to confirm whether the
    requirements are reflected future users and developed to identify users provided
    by useful decisions on how to develop the system. This document also covers the
    user requirements for autonomous security and intend-based network management
    to ensure constant security quality on B5G.</p>"
