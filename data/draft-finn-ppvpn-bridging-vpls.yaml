abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer 2 techniques based on IEEE 802.1Q bridges are in widespread use
    by Ethernet MAN Service Providers. It is possible to implement the data plane
    functionality of Service Provider Backbone as described in the framework draft
    [ANDERSSON] using bridges as the Provider Edge (PE) equipment. There are three
    small but significant changes to the [LASSERRE-VKOMPELLA] VPLS draft which would
    make the Service Provider Backbone much more compatible with a bridge-based PE
    implementation, and which would improve the efficiency of all L2VPN implementations.</p>"
