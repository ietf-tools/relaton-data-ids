abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft attempts to identify potential impacts associated with new,
    extensible metadata facilities in Internet protocols, and suggests possible mitigations.
    Its goal is to have the discussion of these tradeoffs up-front, rather than after
    the development of such mechanisms.</p>"
