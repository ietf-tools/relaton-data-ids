abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL Active/Active Edge enables a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group
    to connect to multiple RBridges which can ingress and egress data traffic for
    the same VLAN at the same time. The purpose of introducing the TRILL Active/Active
    Edge is to increase the access bandwidth and resilience. This new access type
    puts forward new requirements for TRILL control plane. Current TRILL control plane
    need be extended in order to make the TRILL Active/Active Edge operational. Requirements
    are developed in this document as the guidelines for designing those specific
    control plane functions.</p>"
