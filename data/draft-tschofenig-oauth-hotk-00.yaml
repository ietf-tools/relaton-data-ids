abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth 2.0 deployments currently rely on bearer tokens for securing
    access to protected resources. Bearer tokens require Transport Layer Security
    to be used between an OAuth client and the resource server when presenting the
    access token in order to get access. The security model is based on proof-of-possession
    of the access token: access token storage and transfer has to be done with care
    to prevent leakage. There are, however, use cases that require a more active involvement
    of the OAuth client to offer increased security, particularly against token leakage.
    This document specifies an OAuth security framework using ephemeral asymmetric
    credentials that are bound to the access token. A client can create these key
    pairs dynamically and use them, after they are bound to an access token by the
    authorization server, in communication interactions with resource servers. This
    document is discussed at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/oauth. This initial
    version of the specification shall serve as a discussion starter.</p>"
