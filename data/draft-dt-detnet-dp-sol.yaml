abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane encapsulation
    solutions. The described data plane solutions can be applied over either IP or
    MPLS Packet Switched Networks. Comment #1: SB&gt; An overarching comment is that
    the early part of the document is really fundamental architecture and perhaps
    belongs in the arch draft, leaving this draft to be more specific about solutions.
    Indeed if we cannot find a single solution that maps to both IP and MPLS underlays
    I wonder if we should publish two specialist RFCs? Discussion: One document at
    the beginning, split into two if/when needed. Would be post adoption in any case.
    Comment #2: SB&gt; Whilst I think we should look for a common solution to IP and
    MPLS I do not think that this is where the DT ended up. Discussion: Agree.</p>"
