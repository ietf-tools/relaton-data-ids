abstract:
- content: "<p>Nowadays users consumption style for video and multimedia applications
    is strongly changing. Users are heavily counting on wireless and mobile devices
    for video streaming and interactive video and multimedia applications. This can
    be implemented for instance by having more intelligence in the service and the
    network infrastructure to better suit a differentiated users consumption style.
    This can be achieved through having: (i) a knowledge in the network and service
    platform about the available device and network conditions for the end-user and
    (ii) a knowledge in the network about the content requirements in terms of devices
    capabilities and network resources for content stored either in the network or
    in the application server. To obtain such knowledge with no need for changing
    the current infrastructure and in a generalized way to all applications, feedback/notification
    mechanisms between the end-user application, the network and the service platform
    is needed to provide information helping the content delivery and adaptation decisions.
    This document is investigating such application-agnostic track. This document
    extends the Port Control Protocol (PCP) RFC 6887 [RFC6887] to allow: (i) the users
    application to notify the network and application server about its available resources
    in terms of devices capabilities and network conditions as well as information
    about the user (e.g., location, mobility status) and (ii) the application server
    to notify the network about the requirements of the content it stores in terms
    of devices and network resources. A new PCP option, denoted the FEEDBACK, is specified
    to allow such feedback notification signaling. This option is used with both PEER
    and MAP Opcodes.</p>"
