abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment of large-scale AI services within data centers introduces
    significant challenges to established technologies, including load balancing and
    congestion control. Additionally, the adoption of cutting-edge network technologies,
    such as in-network computing, is on the rise within AI-centric data centers. These
    advanced network-assisted application acceleration technologies necessitate the
    flexible exchange of cross-layer interaction information between end-hosts and
    network nodes. The Application-aware Data Center Network (APDN) leverages the
    Application-aware Networking (APN) framework for application side to furnish the
    data center network with detailed application-aware information. This approach
    facilitates the rapid advancement of network-application co-design technologies.
    This document delves into the use cases of APDNs and outlines the associated requirements,
    setting the stage for enhanced performance and efficiency in data center operations
    tailored to the demands of AI services.</p>"
