abstract:
- content: <p>Updating key exchange and public-key encryption protocols to resist
    attack by quantum computers is a high priority given the possibility of "harvest
    now, decrypt later" attacks. Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is a widely-used
    public key encryption scheme based on combining a Key Encapsulation Mechanism
    (KEM), a Key Derivation Function (KDF), and an Authenticated Encryption with Associated
    Data (AEAD) scheme. In this document, we define KEM algorithms for HPKE based
    on both post-quantum KEMs and hybrid constructions of post- quantum KEMs with
    traditional KEMs, as well as a KDF based on SHA-3 that is suitable for use with
    these KEMs. When used with these algorithms, HPKE is resilient with respect to
    attack by a quantum computer.</p>
