abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo splits message submission from message relay, allowing each
    service to operate according to its own rules (for security, policy, etc.), and
    specifies what actions are to be taken by a submission server. Message relay and
    final delivery are unaffected, and continue to use SMTP over port 25. When conforming
    to this document, message submission uses the protocol specified here, normally
    over port 587. This separation of function offers a number of benefits, including
    the ability to apply specific security or policy requirements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
