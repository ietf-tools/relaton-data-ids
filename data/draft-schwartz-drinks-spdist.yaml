abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for distributing session establishment
    data from often centralized Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data
    stores into local data repositories for local querying of the data. The distributed
    data is typically used by various network elements for session peering. This document
    describes the Session Peering Distribution Protocol (SPDP) that should be seen
    as an extension to the session peering provisioning protocol defining the provisioning
    process itself. The document provides a set of guiding principles for the design
    of this protocol including an extension of the SPPP basic data model for distribution
    purposes and an associated extension XML Schema Document.</p>"
