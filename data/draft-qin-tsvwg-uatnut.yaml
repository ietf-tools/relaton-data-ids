abstract:
- content: "<p>Photos, videos and other upstream traffics generated by end users are
    rapidly increasing these days and expected to continue doing so in the future.
    A lot of factors, such as long round-trip-time (RTT), low robustness of delivery,
    and transport bottlenecks, etc., lead to low upload rate, which cause poor user
    experiences. This draft discusses an Upload Acceleration Transport Network(UATN)
    for upstream traffics that use distributed cache servers and separates the upload
    transaction into two parts for greater network efficiency.</p>"
