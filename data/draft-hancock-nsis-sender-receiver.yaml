abstract:
- content: "<p>The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling for resources
    for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The requirements for such signaling
    are being developed in [2] and a framework in [3]. It is clear from existing work
    that there are many interrelated issues with NSIS signaling, concerning the respective
    roles of the two ends of the communication path. These issues include route finding,
    authorisation, state management requirements, localization of negotiation, and
    so on. The wide variety of problems involved hinders progress in deciding what
    approach NSIS should adopt. This Internet Draft attempts to provide a summary
    of these issues and suggests a way of structuring further analysis. It is not
    expected that this document should have a long term existence.</p>"
