abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION) extended is a way to get information
    about the version of a DNS in the backend. For example when a DNSSEC signer for
    a zone generates a new SOA serial, because it has created new RRSIG records, the
    original data has not changed, but this is not visible to anyone looking at the
    zone. This document will make it possible show the zone information which is the
    base of the presented data.</p>"
