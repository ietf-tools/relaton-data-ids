abstract:
- content: "<p>This document offers guidance on incorporating Post-Quantum Cryptography
    (PQC) into resource-constrained devices, including IoT devices and lightweight
    Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), which operate under tight limitations on compute
    power, memory, storage, and energy. It highlights the role of the Root of Trust
    in enabling secure operations, including seed-based key generation to reduce the
    need for persistent storage, efficient approaches to managing ephemeral keys,
    and methods for offloading cryptographic tasks in low-resource environments. Additionally,
    it examines how PQC affects firmware update mechanisms in such constrained systems.</p>"
