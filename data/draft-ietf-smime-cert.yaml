- content: "<p>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), provides a method
    to send and receive secure MIME messages. Before using a public key to provide
    security services, the S/MIME agent MUST certify that the public key is valid.
    S/MIME agents MUST use PKIX certificates to validate public keys as described
    in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) Certificate and CRL Profile.
