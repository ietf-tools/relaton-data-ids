abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines "Annodex", an exchange format for annotated
    and indexed time-continuous bitstreams. Annodex provides a bitstream format for
    exchanging multitrack interleaved time-continuous bitstreams and textual meta
    information attached to temporal fragments of the binary bitstreams. The meta
    information is given in the Continuous Media Markup Language (CMML). Annodex enables
    integration of time-continuous bitstreams into the browsing and searching functionality
    of the World Wide Web.</p>
