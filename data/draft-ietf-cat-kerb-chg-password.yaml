abstract:
- content: "<p>The Kerberos V5 protocol [RFC1510] does not describe any mechanism
    for users to change their own passwords. In order to promote interoperability
    between workstations, personal computers, terminal servers, routers, and KDC's
    from multiple vendors, a common password changing protocol is required.</p>"
