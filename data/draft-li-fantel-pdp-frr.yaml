abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a fast reroute architecture within the programmable
    data plane (PDP-FRR) for enhancing network resilience through rapid failure detection
    and swift path migration, leveraging in-band network telemetry and source routing.
    Unlike traditional methods that rely on the control plane and face significant
    delays in rerouting, the proposed architecture utilizes a white-box modeling of
    the data plane to distinguish and analyze packet losses accurately, enabling immediate
    identification for link failures (including black- hole and gray failures). By
    utilizing in-band network telemetry and source routing, the proposed solution
    significantly reduces reroute times to a few milliseconds, offering a substantial
    improvement over existing practices and marking a pivotal advancement in failure
    tolerance.</p>"
