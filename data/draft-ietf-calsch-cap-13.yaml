abstract:
- content: "<p>The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) is an Internet protocol described
    in this memo that permits a Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent
    (CUA) to access an [iCAL] based Calendar Store (CS). The CAP definition is based
    on requirements identified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calendaring
    and Scheduling (CALSCH) Working Group. More information about the IETF CALSCH
    Working Group activities can be found on the IMC web site at http:// www.imc.org/ietf-calendar
    and at the IETF web site at http:// www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html
    [1]. Refer to the references within this memo for further information on how to
    access these various documents.</p>"
