abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR_SPEC object
    for communicating errors. That object has a defined format that permits the definition
    of 256 error codes. As RSVP has been developed and extended, the convention has
    been to be conservative in defining new error codes. Further, no provision for
    user defined errors exists in RSVP. This document defines a new RSVP object to
    permit user defined error values to be communicated.</p>"
