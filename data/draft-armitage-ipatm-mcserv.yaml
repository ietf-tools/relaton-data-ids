abstract:
- content: "<p>In some environments the consumption of reassembly contexts and VC
    space may be too high for all Class D groups to use full VC meshes as described
    in Internet Draft draft-armitage-ipatm-ipmc-02.txt ('IP Multicast over UNI 3.0
    based ATM Networks'). This memo explores possible ways of sharing the load between
    Multicast Servers and full VC meshes in an RFC 1577/UNI3.0 environment.</p>"
