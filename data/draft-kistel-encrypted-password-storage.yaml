abstract:
- content: <p>Current password storage methods predominantly use cryptographic hash
    functions in order to avoid storing users' passwords in clear text. Unfortunately,
    recent advancements in hardware design (notably GPUs) allow an attacker to try
    millions or even billions of password guesses per second which makes "decryption"
    of simple passwords feasible in short amounts of time. This document describes
    a password storage scheme that incorporates public key encryption in order to
    slow down password verification. Since public key algorithms are several orders
    of magnitude slower than hash functions, the result makes it much harder for an
    attacker to discover users' passwords from the stored, encrypted format.</p>
