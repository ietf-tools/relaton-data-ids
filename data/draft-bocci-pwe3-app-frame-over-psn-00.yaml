abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides an applicability statement for the transparent
    AAL5 PDU frame mode encapsulation in draft-fischer [4]. Draft-fischer describes
    methods to carry ATM services over IP, L2TP or MPLS. The PSN (e.g. MPLS) is used
    to transport ATM layer services such as those defined by ITU-T as ATM transfer
    capabilities [2] and the ATM Forum as ATM service categories [3]. The basic requirement
    is to transparently transport ATM VCC service related information (e.g., traffic
    parameters, QoS, OAM, etc.) over the Pseudo Wire (PW), over the packet network.
    Transparent PDU frame mode enables bandwidth efficiency gains to be realized for
    ATM VCCs that use AAL5, yet still provide full ATM transparency, including the
    correct sequencing of OAM cells on an AAL5 flow.</p>"
