abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Internet PKI, trust anchor keys are distributed as self- signed
    X.509 security certificates. This document specifies a trust anchor key renewal
    mechanism that leverages the confidence in the initial certificate distribution.
    A non-critical X.509 certificate extension holds a sequence of opaque octet strings.
    The trust anchor renewal operation occurs upon receipt of a message that hashes
    to one of those octet strings.</p>"
