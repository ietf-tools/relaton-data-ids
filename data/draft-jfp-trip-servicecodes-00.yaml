abstract:
- content: "<p>Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) [2] provides a means for entities
    in a VoIP network to advertise telephony routes to their peers. No assumption
    can be made about the treatment which is offered by an endpoint propagating a
    route - it could intend to terminate the call in some fashion or apply services
    to the call. This document proposes an optional ServiceCode attribute propagated
    along with such routes which provides more information about the services offered
    by the originator.</p>"
