abstract:
- content: "<p>Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, public sector,
    and cloud service providers today in order to both complement and augment host-based
    security solutions. TLS 1.3 introduces several changes to TLS 1.2 with a goal
    to improve the overall security and privacy provided by TLS. However some of these
    changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions. While this
    may be viewed as a feature, there are several real-life use case scenarios that
    are not easily solved without such network-based security solutions. In this document,
    we identify the TLS 1.3 changes that may impact network-based security solutions
    and provide a set of use case scenarios that are not easily solved without such
    solutions.</p>"
