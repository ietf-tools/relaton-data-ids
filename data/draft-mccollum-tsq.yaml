abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a modern, secure, and extensible time synchronization
    protocol designed to operate over the QUIC transport protocol. Known as TSQ (Time
    Synchronization over QUIC), this protocol aims to address the limitations of traditional
    NTP by leveraging QUIC's encryption, widespread UDP/443 acceptance, and multiplexed
    stream capabilities. TSQ is designed for contemporary deployment environments,
    including enterprise networks, cloud-native systems, containers, and mobile devices,
    where traditional UDP-based NTP struggles with security, scalability, or operational
    reliability.</p>"
