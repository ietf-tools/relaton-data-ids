abstract:
- content: "<p>This document mainly analyzes the key revocation issue with host identities
    (HIs) in the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). Generally, key revocation is an important
    functionality of key management systems; it is concerned with the issues of removing
    antique cryptographic keys from operational usages when they are not secure or
    not secure enough any more. This functionality is particularly important for the
    security systems expected to execute for long periods. This document also attempts
    to investigate several key issues that a designer of HI revocation mechanisms
    need to carefully consider.</p>"
