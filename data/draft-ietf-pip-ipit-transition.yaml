abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a transition scheme for moving from IP to Pip.
    While this document discusses Pip in particular, it could be applied to any IPng.
    The transition scheme discussed here is called IPIT, for IP Independent Transition.
    It has been developed to address problems with the IPAE transition scheme, after
    which the previous Pip transition scheme was based. The shortcomings of IPAE stem
    from its reliance on IP addresses during the first phases of transition. The result
    is that IP-only hosts will not be able to talk globally to IPng hosts after IP
    addresses have depleted (they will only be able to talk intra-domain). IPIT allows
    new Pip systems to talk to IP systems without a globally unique IP address. As
    a result, IP address depletion is less likely with IPIT, and IP-only hosts will
    be able to talk to Pip hosts forever. In this sense, IPIT is as much a co-existence
    scheme as it is a transition scheme.</p>"
