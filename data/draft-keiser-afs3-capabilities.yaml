abstract:
- content: <p>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed at
    Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s. AFS-3 heavily leverages Remote Procedure
    Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed architecture. In 2003, new
    RPCs were introduced into AFS-3 that provide for capability querying between file
    servers and cache managers. This memo provides a formal specification for that
    functionality, and provides analogous extensions to the volume server RPC interface.
