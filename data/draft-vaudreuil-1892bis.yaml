abstract:
- content: <p>The Multipart/Report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type
    is a general "family" or "container" type for electronic mail reports of any kind.
    Although this memo defines only the use of the Multipart/Report content-type with
    respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit if a
    single content-type is used to for all kinds of reports. This document is part
    of a four document set describing the delivery status report service. This collection
    includes the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) extensions to request delivery
    status reports, a MIME content for the reporting of delivery reports, an enumeration
    of extended status codes, and a multipart container for the delivery report, the
    original message, and a human-friendly summary of the failure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
