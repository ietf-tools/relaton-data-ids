abstract:
- content: "<p>NFS Version 4 [RFC3010] provided support for client/server interactions
    to support replication and migration, but left unspecified how replication and
    migration would be done. This document discusses the nature of a protocol to be
    used to transfer filesystem data and metadata for use with replication and migration
    services for NFS Version 4.</p>"
