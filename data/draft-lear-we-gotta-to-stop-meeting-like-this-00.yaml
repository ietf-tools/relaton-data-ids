    world. Somewhere around 1,000 people all get into planes, consume carbon, and
    then attend various meetings in what often is a jetlagged stupor. We gotta to
    stop meeting like this. This draft calls on the LLC to research on the community's
    behalf new modalities for IETF face-to-face meetings.</p>"
