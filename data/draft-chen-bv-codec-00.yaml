abstract:
- content: "<p>BroadVoice(R) [bv-website] is a family of two open-source speech codecs
    suitable for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications. It is designed to achieve high
    speech quality with relatively low complexity and a very low coding delay. BroadVoice
    consists of two variants: a 16 kb/s narrowband codec for 8 kHz sampling called
    BroadVoice16, or BV16, and a 32 kb/s wideband codec for 16 kHz sampling called
    BroadVoice32, or BV32. BV16 and BV32 are standard codecs of PacketCable(TM), SCTE(R),
    and ANSI for VoIP applications in cable telephony, and they are also listed as
    optional codecs in the ITU-T Recommendations J.161 and J.361, respectively. This
    document describes the BV16 and BV32 speech codecs.</p>"
