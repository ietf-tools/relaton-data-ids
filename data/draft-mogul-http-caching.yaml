abstract:
- content: "<p>I propose a caching design for HTTP 1.1, including the definition of
    terms, the description of a model, the specification of related HTTP headers,
    and the algorithms to be used. The proposed design uses opaque cache validators
    and explicit expiration values to allow the server to control the tradeoff between
    cache performance and staleness of the data presented to users. The server may
    choose to ensure that a user never unwittingly sees stale data, or to minimize
    network traffic, or to compromise between these two extremes. The proposed design
    also allows the server to control whether a client sees stale data after another
    client performs an update. This draft is not intended to become a standards-track
    document. The ultimate output of the HTTP subgroup will be a set of changes to
    the HTTP/1.1 draft specification [1]. In the interests of making rapid forward
    progress and in capturing some of the motivation and rationale of our design(s),
    it seems useful to produce an Internet-draft document in the interim. Note that
    this draft in its entirety does not currently represent the consensus of the subgroup,
    although several sections do represent an apparent consensus.</p>"
