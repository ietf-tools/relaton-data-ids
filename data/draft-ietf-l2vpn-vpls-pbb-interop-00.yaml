abstract:
- content: <p>The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be improved
    by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality in VPLS access. Provider
    Backbone Bridging has been standardized as IEEE 802.1ah-2008, and aims to improve
    the scalability of MAC addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks.
    This document describes different interoperability scenarios where Provider Backbone
    Bridge functionality is used in H-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS access network to
    attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number
    of service instances. The document also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms
    for incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality within H-VPLS with existing
    Ethernet access and interoperability among them. Furthermore, the document discusses
    the migration mechanisms and scenarios by which Provider Backbone Bridge functionality
    can be incorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access. Conventions used in
    this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
