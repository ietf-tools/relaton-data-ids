abstract:
- content: "<p>The recipient of the REFER method [1] creates an implicit subscription
    to the 'refer' event. This subscription causes the REFER recipient to send NOTIFY
    messages to the sender informing him of the progress of the REFER. This memo provides
    for the requirements and one potential mechanism to suppress the creation of this
    implicit subscription, via an option tag - 'norefersub'. This gives the agent
    sending the REFER control over the creation of the subscription, while being backwards
    compatible with [1].</p>"
