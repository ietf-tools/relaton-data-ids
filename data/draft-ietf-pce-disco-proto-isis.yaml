abstract:
- content: "<p>There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a
    Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover
    a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs), along with information that can be
    used by the PCC for PCE selection. When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR)
    participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating
    passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of
    using IGP flooding. For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the
    Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement
    of PCE Discovery information within an IS-IS area or within the entire IS-IS routing
    domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
