abstract:
- content: "<p>In an IPv6 home network, there is a possibility that the residential
    gateway, learns a different IPv6 prefix after each dial-up; attempts to communicate
    using old address would thus fail. This implies that we should not attempt to
    trigger dial-up by simply sending the first packet of a connection.</p>"
