abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 transition is becoming an important research topic recently. In
    traditional architecture, transition mechanisms are closely connected with application,
    protocol stack, and network equipments. This makes the transition process very
    complicated, and increases the difficulty of network management. In this document,
    we present a new network architecture called Univer6. It uses IPv6 as a unified
    middle layer,thus can adapt to various kinds of applications and network equipments.
    Univer6 will help provide a smooth transition towards IPv6, simplify network management
    process, and accelerate the development of IPv6.</p>"
