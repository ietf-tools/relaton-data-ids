abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a TCP Simple Authentication Option (TCP-SA)
    which is intended to replace the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC-2385 (TCP/MD5).
    TCP-SA specifies the use of stronger HMAC-based hashes and provides more details
    on the association of security associations with TCP connections. TCP-SA assumes
    an external, out-of-band mechanism (manual or via a separate protocol) for session
    key establishment, parameter negotiation, and rekeying, replicating the separation
    of key management and key use as in the IPsec suite. The result is intended to
    be a simple modification to support current infrastructure uses of TCP/MD5, such
    as to protect BGP and LDP, to support a larger set of hashes with minimal other
    system and operational changes. TCP-SA requires no new option identifier, though
    it is intended to be mutually exclusive with TCP/MD5 on a given TCP connection.
    It can be used in the presence of NATs/NAPTs, and supports IPv6, and is fully
    compatible with requirements under development for an update to TCP/MD5.</p>"
