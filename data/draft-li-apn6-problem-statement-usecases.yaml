abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better network
    services for users. As the ever developing 5G and industrial verticals evolve,
    more and more services that have diverse network requirements such as ultra-low
    latency and high reliability are emerging, and therefore differentiated service
    treatment is desired by users. However, network operators are typically unaware
    of which applications are traversing their network infrastructure, which means
    that only coarse-grained services can be provided to users. As a result, network
    operators are only evolving their infrastructure to be large but dumb pipes without
    corresponding revenue increases that might be enabled by differentiated service
    treatment. As network technologies evolve including deployments of IPv6 and SRv6,
    the programmability provided by IPv6 and SRv6 encapsulations can be augmented
    by conveying application related information into the network. Adding application
    knowledge to the network layer allows applications to specify finer granularity
    requirements to the network operator. This document analyzes the existing problems
    caused by lack of application awareness, and outlines various use cases that could
    benefit from an Application-aware IPv6 Networking (APN6) architecture.</p>"
