abstract:
- content: "<p>Without caches in the infrastructure, peer to peer content delivery's
    primary effect is cost shifting rather than cost savings. Even with perfect localization,
    depending on the relative cost of last-mile uplink bandwidth verses transport
    bandwidth, P2P may substantially increase aggregate cost. Yet the addition of
    edge caches, caches located in the ISPs near the customers, radically change the
    economics of P2P content delivery. Edge caches interact very strongly with localization
    services for P2P content delivery, and any localization service must be tightly
    integrated into edge-cache operation.</p>"
