abstract:
- content: "<p>During handover from one access router to another, a wireless mobile
    node may need to have a certain amount of state information passed from the Previous-Router
    to the new one. This document specifies extensions to Mobile IPv6 which allow
    additional control structures enabling the transfer of the necessary state during
    handovers. This state transfer allows the applications running on the mobile node
    to operate with reduced latency, minimal disruption, and reduced packet loss during
    handovers.</p>"
