abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a high level conceptual discussion on the significant
    modeling differences affecting the treatment of a POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
    call, a GETS (Government Emergency Telephone Service) call, and an MLPP (Multilevel
    Priority and Preemption) call in the traditional voice PSTN (Public Switched Telephone
    Network). The genesis for this discussion on these services is primarily from
    experience with the United States capabilities and it is appreciated that these
    types of calls may be very different or non-existent in other regions of the world.
    Still, it may be useful to provide this discussion as a background, which may
    be useful in understanding the legacy operations as the chartered ieprep work
    progresses. It should be made clear from the onset that this document suggests
    no requirements or solutions, but is merely informative about the tradition voice
    network treatments.</p>"
