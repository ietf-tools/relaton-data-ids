abstract:
- content: "<p>The Softwire Hub and Spoke Framework document outlines three steps
    for the Softwire Initiator (SI) and PPP peer of the Softwire Concentrator (SC)
    over IPv4 connectivity to be fully configured for IPv6 once the PPP session has
    been established. For the same function over IPv6 connectivity, however, only
    one additional step is needed. This is because IPv6CP only defines the Interface-Identifier
    option. This document defines additional host configuration options for IPv6CP
    so that the operational model of IPCP is extended to IPv6CP to reduce requirements
    on the SI and SC.</p>"
