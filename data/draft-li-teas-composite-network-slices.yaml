abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing can be used to meet the connectivity and performance
    requirement of different applications or customers in a shared network. An IETF
    network slice may be used for 5G or other network scenarios. In the context of
    5G, a 5G end-to-end network slice consists of three different types of network
    technology segments: Radio Access Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and Core
    Network (CN). The transport segments of the 5G end-to-end network slice can be
    provided using IETF network slices. In some scenarios, IETF network slices may
    span multiple network domains, and IETF network slices may be composed hierarchically,
    which means a network slice may itself be further sliced. This document first
    describes the possible use cases of composite IETF network slices, then it provides
    considerations about the realization of composite IETF network slices. For the
    interaction between IETF network slices with 5G network slices, the identifiers
    of the 5G network slice may be introduced into IETF networks. For the multi-domain
    IETF network slices, the Inter-Domain Network Resource Partition Identifier (Inter-domain
    NRP ID) is defined. For the hierarchical IETF network slices, the structure of
    the NRP ID is discussed. These network slice-related identifiers may be used in
    the data plane, control plane and management plane of the network for the instantiation
    and management of composite IETF network slices. This document also describes
    the management considerations of composite network slices.</p>"
