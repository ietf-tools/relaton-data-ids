abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the AAA/EAP authentication
    and key management framework that allows an EAP peer to perform fast re-authentications
    with the local EAP server after an initial full EAP authentication using a legacy
    EAP method with the same or another EAP server. EAP-FRAP eliminates the need for
    exchanges between the local EAP server and the home EAP server each time the EAP
    peers is authenticated. In wireless networks, this allows the mobile device to
    reduce hand-off delays. The EAP-FRAP extension does not require changes in underlying
    layer protocols. Which makes is back-ward compatible with existing infrastructures
    and easily deployable with minimal costs.</p>"
