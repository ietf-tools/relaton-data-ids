abstract:
- content: "<p>DOTS communications are machine-to-machine oriented communications.
    In addition DOTS agents are expected to end up in a large number of entities.
    As a result, in addition to secure, the naming scheme to identify all DOTS agents
    must be scalable. For these reasons this document recommends the use of cryptographic
    identifiers or strong Identities as opposed to human readable identifiers for
    example. This document proposes two forms of strong Identities for the registration
    and operation of DOTS Agents. One is 802.1AR LDevID [Std-802.1AR-2009] X.509 certificates.
    The other is raw public keys as in HIP [RFC7401] or TLS/DTLS Raw Public Keys [RFC7250].</p>"
