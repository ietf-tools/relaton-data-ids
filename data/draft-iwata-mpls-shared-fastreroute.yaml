abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an enhanced scheme for fast rerouting which
    provides means of quickly repairing LSPs in cases of link/node failures. It also
    provides for the sharing of backup LSPs and their resources and thus allows minimization
    of requirements for backup resources.</p>"
