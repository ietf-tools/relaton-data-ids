abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the format and semantics associated to a 'file'
    event package that allows SIP endpoints to publish the availability of files.
    A file can be, for example, images, video files, audio files, etc. The event package
    reuses the eXtended Mark-up Language (XML) 'file-metadata' document to provide
    file descriptions. This event package also allows SIP endpoints to subscribe to
    changes in the availability of files, or perform searches for the availability
    and location of a given file. Support for partial notifications and publications
    is also accomplished by using XML patch operations.</p>"
