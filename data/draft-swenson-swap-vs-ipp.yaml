abstract:
- content: "<p>IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) has been compared in conversations
    to SWAP (Simple Workflow Access Protocol). Both are for starting an asynchronous
    job, and then being able to check up on it later. The IPP is specifically designed
    for printers and print jobs. SWAP is more generic, and is generally oriented toward
    more computational jobs. But many of the problems encountered are the same, and
    the approach to the solutions can be examined and compared. This document goes
    through the features point by point and shows in what ways they are similar, and
    more importantly in what ways their approaches differ. The purpose of this is
    to guide discussions about the two protocols.</p>"
