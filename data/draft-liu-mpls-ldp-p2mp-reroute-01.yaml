abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) for the reroute of point to multi-point (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
    in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. The solution relies on LDP
    only and has no requirement of a multicast routing protocol in the network. Protocol
    elements and procedures for this solution are described for rerouting a P2MP LSP
    in the following cases:1)network failure (link or node); 2)a better path emerges
    (e.g. new link available, metric change);3)planned maintenance. The rerouting
    mechanism described in this document can minimize the time of traffic disruption
    when network failure happens. It will also minimize the data duplication and guarantee
    the traffic continuity during the procedure of rerouting in the last two cases
    mentioned above.</p>"
