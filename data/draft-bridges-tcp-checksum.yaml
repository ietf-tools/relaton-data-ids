abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of embedded trailer checksums in TCP,
    and proposes an extension to TCP to negotiate the use of embedded trailer checksums
    for a TCP connection. Embedded trailer checksums reside in the last two octets
    of the segment's data field. The negotiation mechanism proposed in this document
    allows for new TCP implementations to exchange segments bearing embedded trailer
    checksums while still being able to inter-operate with TCP implementations that
    do not support them. The performance gain achieved by assisting software's checksumming
    of TCP segments with hardware has been clearly demonstrated in some existing TCP
    implementations. The authors claim that the price and performance gains achieved
    by providing hardware assists for Embedded Trailer Checksums are even greater.
    These gains are particularly apparent when employed over segmenting links such
    as Fibre Channel and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). TCP implementations that
    do not use hardware checksum assists will not suffer any performance penalty by
    supporting Embedded Trailer Checksums.</p>"
