abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
    public key algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). The ECC algorithms
    support the creation of digital signatures and the exchange of keys to encrypt
    or authenticate content. The definition of the algorithm processing is based on
    the NIST FIPS 186-3 for digital signature, NIST SP800-56A and SEC1 for key agreement,
    RFC 3370 and RFC 3565 for key wrap and content encryption, NIST FIPS 180-3 for
    message digest, SEC1 for key derivation, and RFC 2104 and RFC 4231 for message
    authentication code standards. This document obsoletes RFC 3278. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
