abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we address to potential adapt authorization frameworks
    for the future AI agent. An extension is proposed in the OAuth 2.0 protocol with
    an optional field *target_id* for granular authorization. It can be seen useful
    for the future virtual/physical AI agents. By explicitly identifying the target
    during authorization, the draft aims to support precise permission management
    and enhance traceability. Serveral risks can be mitigated through the proposed
    extension, such as potential unauthorized or malicious behavior of AI components
    in the netowrk, while the compatibility of existing OAuth 2.0 workflows is still
    maintained.</p>"
