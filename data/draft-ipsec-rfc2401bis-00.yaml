abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the base architecture for IPsec compliant systems.
    The goal of the architecture is to provide various security services for traffic
    at the IP layer, in both the IPv4 and IPv6 environments. This document describes
    the goals of such systems, their components and how they fit together with each
    other and into the IP environment. It also describes the security services offered
    by the IPsec protocols, and how these services can be employed in the IP environment.
    This document does not address all aspects of IPsec architecture. Subsequent documents
    will address additional architectural details of a more advanced nature, e.g.,
    use of IPsec in NAT environments and more complete support for IP multicast. The
    following fundamental components of the IPsec security architecture are discussed
    in terms of their underlying, required functionality. Additional RFCs (see Section
    1.3 for pointers to other documents) define the protocols in (a), (c), and (d).</p>"
