abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath Traffic Engineering (MPTE) combines two approaches to traffic
    management: equal-cost multipath and constraint-based traffic engineering, offering
    a powerful new way to engineer networks. To avail of this, a node (possibly an
    ingress of a MPTE tunnel, or a path computation agent) must have information about
    the topology, link and node characteristics of a network so that it can compute
    the components of the MPTE tunnel. One important (node) characteristic is whether
    a given node supports MPTE, i.e., whether it can participate in the provisioning
    and maintenance of the tunnel. This memo shows how this information can be distributed
    in the IGP via Link State Routing TE Capabilities.</p>"
