abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new client type for the COPS protocol to
    support Multiprotocol-DiffServ inter-working in a network scenario where the access
    network is a non-DiffServ network. In such a scenario, traffic flows originating
    from heterogeneous applications ask to be admitted to the Diffserv core network.
    The Policy Decision Point (PDP) acts as a 'Bandwidth Broker' for Policy Enforcement
    Points(PEP) requesting resources. The new client type is located on each Border
    Router (PEP) of the Diffserv Network.</p>"
