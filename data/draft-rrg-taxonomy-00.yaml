abstract:
- content: "<p>The Routing Research Group is tasked to design a new routing architecture
    to meet the challenges of scalability in face of pervasive multi-homing and inter-domain
    traffic engineering. A number of solutions have been proposed. This draft describes
    a taxonomy for the design space, and then uses the taxonomy to discuss and compare
    the proposed solutions.</p>"
