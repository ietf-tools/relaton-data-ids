abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Via
    header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP entity acting as
    an entry point to a transit network to indicate from which adjacent upstream network
    a SIP request is received, using a network realm value associated with the adjacent
    network.</p>
