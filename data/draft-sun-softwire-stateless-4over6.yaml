abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a stateless 4over6 mechanism which moves the
    translation function from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators (B4s). It is
    used for service providers offering residual deployment of the IPv4 service across
    IPv6-only domains. The concentrator will record the full set of prefix mapping
    rules independent of the number of subscribers, while the initiator will only
    keep a single rule of its own sub-domain. The BNG devices can learn the rule set
    further, to achieve traffic optimization between initiators. In this way, it not
    only achieve scalability and simplicity feature benefits from stateless address
    mapping, but also keep CPE functions simple. Besides, flexible addressing and
    scattered IPv4 address blocks can be supported as well. Traffic optimization can
    be deployed incrementally when necessary.</p>"
