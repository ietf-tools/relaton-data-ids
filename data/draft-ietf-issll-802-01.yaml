abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the support of IETF Integrated Services over
    LANs built from IEEE 802 network segments which may be interconnected by draft
    standard IEEE P802.1p switches. It describes the practical capabilities and limitations
    of this technology for supporting Controlled Load [8] and Guaranteed Service [9]
    using the inherent capabilities of the relevant 802 technologies [5],[6] etc.
    and the proposed 802.1p queuing features in switches. IEEE P802.1p [2] is a superset
    of the existing IEEE 802.1D bridging specification. This document provides a functional
    model for the layer 3 to layer 2 and user-to-network dialogue which supports admission
    control and defines requirements for interoperability between switches. The special
    case of such networks where the sender and receiver are located on the same segment
    is also discussed. This scheme expands on the ISSLL over 802 LANs framework described
    in [7]. It makes reference to an admission control signaling protocol developed
    by the ISSLL WG which is known as the 'Subnet Bandwidth Manager'. This is an extension
    to the IETF's RSVP protocol [4] and is described in a separate document [10].</p>"
