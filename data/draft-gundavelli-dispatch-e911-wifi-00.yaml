abstract:
- content: "<p>Proposed is an approach for supporting emergency 911 services over
    IEEE 802.11 based Wi-Fi access networks. This approach leverages the legal framework
    and the building blocks of the OpenRoaming federation for extending emergency
    911 calling support to already deployed tens of thousands of OpenRoaming Wi-Fi
    hotspots. The proposal addresses the key issues in emergency calling, around discovery
    and authentication to access network supporting emergency services, emergency
    access credentials, location determination of the emergency caller, and delivering
    emergency voice service configuration to the device and call routing.</p>"
