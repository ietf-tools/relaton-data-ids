abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Firewalls and Service Tickets protocol.
    A ticket is data that accompanies a packet and indicates a granted right to traverse
    a network or a request for network service to be applied. Applications request
    tickets from a local agent in the network and attach issued tickets to packets.
    Firewall tickets are issued to grant packets the right to traverse a network;
    service tickets indicate the desired service to be applied to a packets. A single
    ticket may provide both firewall and service ticket information. Tickets are sent
    in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.</p>"
