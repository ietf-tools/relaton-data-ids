abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the means for transferring a LISP Delegated Database
    Tree (LISP-DDT) between DDT nodes and for notifying DDT nodes that the database
    has changed since it was last transferred. The LISP-DDT is a hierarchical, distributed
    database that provides delegation of authority for mappings from LISP EIDs to
    RLOCs. A DDT node may be delegated authority for an Extended EID-prefix and maintains
    RLOCs for Map Servers and other DDT nodes to which authority has been delegated
    for more specific EID-prefixes of the that prefix. This document does not describe
    the use of DDT as part of the LISP mapping service.</p>"
