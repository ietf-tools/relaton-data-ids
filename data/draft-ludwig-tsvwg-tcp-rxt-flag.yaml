abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution to TCPâ€™s retransmission ambiguity
    problem. It is based on using a single bit, named the Retransmit (RXT) flag, taken
    from the Reserved field of the TCP header. The TCP sender sets the RXT flag in
    segments containing retransmitted data. In response to such a segment, the TCP
    receiver sends an immediate pure ACK with the RXT flag set. By inspecting the
    RXT flag of the ACKs that arrive after a retransmit the TCP sender can then resolve
    the retransmission ambiguity. This protocol feature provides a basis for future
    TCP enhancements such as schemes to detect and respond to spurious timeouts and
    packet re-orderings.</p>"
