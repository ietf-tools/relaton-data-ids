abstract:
- content: "<p>There exists a class of modems that wish to support the Dynamic Link
    Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep] but do not present a single Layer
    2 network domain as required by DLEP. Such devices may be: o Modems that maintain
    a varying link to some upstream backbone network infrastructure, where the ability
    to announce link state and DLEP metrics is desired, but the concept of a DLEP
    destination router for the backbone does not apply. Examples of such devices can
    include LTE modems, IEEE 802.11 stations not in ad-hoc mode, and some satellite
    terminals. o Modems that provide Layer 3 wide area network connectivity between
    devices, where individual DLEP destinations do exist, but are not directly reachable
    by MAC address. This document introduces an optional extension to the core DLEP
    specification, allowing DLEP to be used between routers and modems that operate
    in this way. Note: o This document is intended as an extension to the core DLEP
    specification, and readers are expected to be fully conversant with the operation
    of core DLEP.</p>"
