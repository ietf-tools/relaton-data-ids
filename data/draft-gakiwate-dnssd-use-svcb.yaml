abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) relies on a sequence of steps to enable
    the discovery and connection to local network services. The use of Service Binding
    (SVCB) resource records during the service discovery process enables service instances
    to advertise properties such as Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
    identifiers and other endpoint configuration options. This document describes
    the use of SVCB / HTTPS RRs in the DNS Service Discovery process as an additional
    step to allow clients to connect to service instances optimally.</p>"
