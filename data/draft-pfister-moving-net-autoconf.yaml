abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a way for multiple routers that are communicating
    on a single link to exchange routing information using Router Advertisements.
    This allows moving networks to communicate with each other through auto-configured
    routers. This document specifies a new flag for the Router Information option
    from ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages and specifies how routers must process
    such options.</p>"
