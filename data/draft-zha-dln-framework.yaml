abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more real time applications, such as VR gaming, high frequency
    trading, Internet of vehicle, require accurate latency guarantee or bound, during
    service provisioning. Providing End-to- End latency guarantee across Internet
    is increasingly attractive while challenging. The main problem with latency guarantee
    on Internet is that packet scheduling is still best-effort, and congestion that
    further introduces latency uncertainty cannot be avoided. This document presents
    a way of describing latency information that mostly rely on the congestion management
    such as queue scheduling, and a framework to use such information to guarantee
    End-to-End latency.</p>"
