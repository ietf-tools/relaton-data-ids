abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to provide
    a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when the user is alerted.
    This is done using the Alert-Info header. However, the reference addresses only
    network resources with specific rendering properties. There is currently no support
    for predefined standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting
    situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without being tied to
    a particular rendering. To overcome this limitation and support new applications,
    a new family of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header fields is defined in this
    specification.</p>"
