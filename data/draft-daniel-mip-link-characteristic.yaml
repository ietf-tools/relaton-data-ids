abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a model for link characteristic information
    delivery from the mobile node to the home agent and correspondent node(s). This
    model allows the home agent and correspondent node(s) to know the characteristics
    of the link the mobile node is currently attached to. Based on this information,
    the home agent and correspondent node(s) may shape ongoing traffic according to
    the current available link capacity (e.g. bandwidth) to the mobile node. This
    model can be applicable for Mobile IPv4 as well as Mobile IPv6.</p>"
