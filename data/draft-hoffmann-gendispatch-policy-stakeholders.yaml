abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETFâ€™s work has significance for wider societal, economic, and
    political communities, though gaps and barriers to engagement with the IETF exist
    for policy experts. This informational draft introduces a problem statement and
    gap analysis of existing initiatives related to policy expert engagement in the
    IETF. It also poses questions we hope to work through with others in the IETF
    community regarding how to better enable policy expert engagement in IETF standardisation,
    and on how we can build a culture which better supports technical and policy experts
    working together to develop more robust standards.</p>"
