abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure yet lightweight protocol for communication over the Internet
    for constrained node networks (CNN) is a pertinent problem. Constrained Application
    Layer Protocol (CoAP) mandates the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
    for a secure transaction over CoAP. But DTLS is not a candidate technology for
    CNNs by design. The DTLS handshake overhead to establish the credentials for a
    session between two end-points in a CNN may not be resource efficient. There are
    ongoing efforts to secure one-time exchanges by ensuring object security at the
    application layer. But a composite standardized mechanism for resource-efficient
    end-to-end security credential establishment is much needed to cater both one-time
    exchanges as well as exchanges over a session. DTLS is essentially a combination
    of two operations: (1) the session protocol to establish the credentials (and
    this is the resource heavy part), (2) the record protocol to protect the information
    (this is the cryptographic part). This draft proposes to distribute the security
    responsibilities such that the session establishment happens in the application
    layer, leveraging the lightweight semantics of CoAP, and the record layer encryption
    happens by reusing the existing DTLS record-layer protocol. This way the proposed
    mechanism enables a resource-efficient session establishment mechanism besides
    reusing the existing DTLS encryption. Assuming a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) environment,
    this draft proposes an embedding of handshake for resource efficient end-to-end
    session establishment into CoAP. The session establishment procedure produces
    the necessary and sufficient inputs for seamless operation of the DTLS record-layer
    to secure the channel. Also, this mechanism ensures a direct security association
    between the end-applications for systems using middleboxes like proxies and/or
    gateways which may not be always trusted. The proposed approach provides a mechanism
    to securely traverse through such middleboxes through an end-to-end trusted channel.</p>"
