abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR), a mechanism
    for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a resolver's encrypted DNS configuration.
    An encrypted resolver discovered in this manner is referred to as a "Designated
    Resolver". This mechanism can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to encrypted
    DNS when only the IP address of a resolver is known. This mechanism is designed
    to be limited to cases where unencrypted resolvers and their designated resolvers
    are operated by the same entity or cooperating entities. It can also be used to
    discover support for encrypted DNS protocols when the name of an encrypted resolver
    is known.</p>
