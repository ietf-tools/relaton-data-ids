abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a set of object classes that can be used to define
    the local representation of the state of the conferences (sessions) that the local
    system is involved in (LASSO: local session state objects). In addition, some
    initial information is given on how to map this state to similar semantics in
    the ITU T.120 series of recommendations. We think these object classes might be
    used as a basis for defining the dynamic state variables visible in the horizontal
    control protocol used in a session. This memo is a submission to the IETF MMUSIC
    working group. Currently, this memo is in ``strawman'' stage. Comments of any
    kind are positively encouraged and should be addressed to the confctrl@isi.edu
    mailing list.</p>"
