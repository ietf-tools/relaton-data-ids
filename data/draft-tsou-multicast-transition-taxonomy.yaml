abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of different contributions to the IETF make proposals in support
    of multicast during the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. This document provides a
    taxonomic framework to make it easier to see how the different proposals relate
    to each other. It analyzes the current work in progress in the light of this framework
    and draws a number of conclusions regarding how this work should move forward
    in the BEHAVE and SOFTWIRES Working Groups.</p>"
