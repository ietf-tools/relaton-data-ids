abstract:
- content: "<p>A management architecture for asset schemas and profiles is needed
    to enable entities in the tokenized assets ecosystem to instantiate tokens within
    one or more asset networks. An asset network may be constrained to support only
    a select class or type of token to be present in the network. In the SATP protocol,
    the receiving gateway at the destination network is assumed in its preparatory
    stages to evaluate the transfer request of a tokenized asset from the sending
    gateway at the origin network. In order to evaluate the proposed transfer, the
    receiving gateway must have access to the asset definition schema upon which the
    token was based in the origin network. The current document discusses the management
    architecture for the asset definition schema and the schema-profiles derived from
    the definition schema.</p>"
