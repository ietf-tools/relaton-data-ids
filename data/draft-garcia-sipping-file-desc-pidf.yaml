abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format
    for representing presence information for a presentity. Presentities publish their
    presence information, typically towards presence agents. PIDF has been extended
    to provide rich presence information, including, for example, the location of
    the presentity, their activities, mood, the capabilities of their user agents,
    etc. Presentities are willing to provide the description of available files at
    watcher's disposal. This might be the case for photographs taken with a mobile
    device, a recorded lecture audio file, etc. This document extends the PIDF to
    provide the syntax and format for the description of files within the PIDF.</p>"
