abstract:
- content: "<p>Adhoc networks are formed by the spontaneous collaboration of wireless
    nodes when no networking infrastructure is available. When communication to the
    Internet is desired, one or more nodes must act as gateways for the adhoc network.
    In this case, global addressing of adhoc nodes is required. This document specifies
    a protocol (node behaviour, information propagation, message format) which allows
    nodes in an adhoc network to discover a gateway/prefix pair which is used in order
    to build an IPv6 global address and, when necessary, to maintain a default route
    towards the Internet.</p>"
