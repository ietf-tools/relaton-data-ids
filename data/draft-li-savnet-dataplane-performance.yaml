abstract:
- content: "<p>Source address validation (SAV) is one important way to mitigate source
    address spoofing attacks. However, there may be concern about whether the source
    address check action of the data plane would cause a great performance loss and
    even affect SAV deployment. This document provides an analysis of data plane implementation
    of SAV mechanisms, including the existing mechanisms and a new mechanism using
    independent SAV table. The data plane performances of different mechanisms are
    tested respectively.</p>"
