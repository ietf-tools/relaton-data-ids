abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the problem of service identification in the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Service identification is the process of determining
    the user-level use case that is driving the signaling being utilized by the user
    agent. While seemingly simple, this process is quite complex, and when not addressed
    properly, can lead to fraud, interoperability problems, and stifling of innovation.
    This document discusses these problems and makes recommendations on how to address
    them.</p>"
