abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes a scalable routing scheme for information centric
    networks. Moving the focus from "nodes" to "information objects" raises scalability
    issue because aggregation of flat name for objects is not easy task and the number
    of addressable information objects is so huge than the IP address space. For scalable
    routing, we propose hierarchically-organized domain architecture. A domain is
    a "logical group" of information objects and each domain has its own ID. The concatenation
    of domain IDs from top level domain to the current domain plays the role of "locator".
    Thus, we can get scalable routing table and it is more scalable by means of "topology
    reduction". More challenging issue is name-based forwarding. It is hard to aggregate
    forwarding table due to flat name space, therefore we propose "reactive path setup".</p>
