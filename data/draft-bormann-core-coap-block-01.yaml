abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    CoAP is based on datagram transport, which limits the maximum size of resource
    representations that can be transferred without too much fragmentation. A previous
    version of this draft defined the Block option. The Block option provides a minimal
    way to transfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion. It is currently
    documented in the WG draft draft-ietf-core-block-00.txt This short I-D attempts
    to pick up some recent discussion on the CoRE mailing list, and defines a more
    general, but also slightly more complex approach. It is intended as an example
    for a complete design based on this discussion, to enable a rational assessment
    of the relative complexities.</p>"
