abstract:
- content: "<p>In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-
    related data. Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP receivers usually
    cannot start consuming the multicast data right after they join the session. Thus,
    they often experience a random acquisition delay. One approach to reduce this
    delay is to use an auxiliary unicast RTP session with a retransmission server
    to receive a burst stream that facilitates rapid acquisition of the multicast
    stream. An RTP receiver may use this approach (or any other approach) to achieve
    rapid acquisition. Yet, due to various factors, performance of the rapid acquisition
    methods usually varies. Furthermore, in some cases the RTP receiver may (or may
    have to) do a simple multicast join. For quality reporting, monitoring and diagnostics
    purposes, it is important to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers
    about their acquisition and presentation experiences. This document addresses
    this issue by defining a new report block type, called Multicast Acquisition (MA)
    Report Block, within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports
    (XR). This document also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report
    block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).</p>"
