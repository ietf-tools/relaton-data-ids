abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use a routing protocol as
    a control plane. This combines several of the benefits of the link layer with
    those of the network layer. For example RBridges use existing link state routing,
    without necessarily requiring configuration, to improve aggregate throughput,
    for RBridge to RBridge traffic. RBridges also may support IP multicast and IP
    address resolution optimizations. They are intended to be applicable to L2 network
    sizes similar to those of conventional bridges and are intended to be backward
    compatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress and transit. They also support
    VLANs (although this generally requires configuration) while otherwise attempting
    to retain as much 'plug and play' as is already available in existing bridges.
    This document proposes an architecture for RBridge systems as a solution to the
    TRILL problem, defines terminology, and describes basic components and desired
    behavior. One (or more) separate documents will specify protocols and mechanisms
    that satisfy the architecture presented herein.</p>"
