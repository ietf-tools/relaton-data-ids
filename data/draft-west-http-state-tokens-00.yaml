- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism which allows HTTP servers to maintain
    stateful sessions with HTTP user agents. It aims to address some of the security
    and privacy considerations which have been identified in existing state management
    mechanisms, providing developers with a well-lit path towards our current understanding
    of best practice.</p>"
