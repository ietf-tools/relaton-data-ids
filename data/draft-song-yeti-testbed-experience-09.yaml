abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built on a single
    root, known as the Root Server System. Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production
    root server testbed that provides an environment where technical and operational
    experiments can safely be performed without risk to production root server infrastructure.
    Yeti DNS is an independently-coordinated project and is not affiliated with the
    IETF, ICANN, IANA, or any Root Server Operator. The objectives of the Yeti Project
    were set by the participants in the project based on experiments that they considered
    would provide valuable information, and with the aim of developing a non-production
    testbed that would be open for use by anyone from the technical community to propose
    or run experiments. The Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes various novel
    and experimental components. These differences from the Root Server System have
    operational consequences; by deploying such a system globally but outside the
    production DNS system, the Yeti DNS project provides an opportunity to gain insight
    into those consequences without threatening the stability of the DNS. This document
    neither addresses the relevant policies under which the Root Server System is
    operated nor makes any proposal for changing any aspect of its implementation
    or operation. This document aims solely to document the technical and operational
    experience of deploying a system which is similar to but different from the Root
    Server System.</p>"
