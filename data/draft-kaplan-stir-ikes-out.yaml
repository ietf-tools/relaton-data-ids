abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism and format for signing source identity
    information of communication requests, in a manner capable of crossing multiple
    communication protocol types - even if the origin's protocol type is unknown.
    This is useful for providing E.164 and other forms of Caller-ID reputability for
    various communication protocols, such as SIP, XMPP, WebRTC, H.323, and SS7/ISUP.</p>"
