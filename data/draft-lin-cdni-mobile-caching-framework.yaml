abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for in-network caching in LTE mobile
    networks. The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the
    problem space of in-network caching and to describe the relationships among the
    various components of mobile networks and the newly added entities, such as content
    nodes and content controller. The framework requires the specification of interfaces
    and mechanisms to address issues such as content placement, request routing and
    content catalog maintenance. The intent of this document is to outline what each
    interface needs to accomplish and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms
    fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other documents.</p>"
