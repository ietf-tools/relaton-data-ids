abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCP Relay Agents eliminate the necessity of having a DHCP server on
    each physical network. In certain network configurations, a DHCP server may be
    multiple subnets away from the DHCP client and multiple Relay Agents may be configured
    to relay DHCP messages to and from DHCP client. Such configuration can be supported
    only when each Relay Agent adds certain Information to DHCP messages before relaying
    them. This additional information helps in relaying the DHCP reply back to the
    DHCP client through the same path. This mechanism is referred as Relay Chaining.</p>"
