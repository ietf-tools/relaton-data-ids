abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to describe, in some detail, the meaning
    and use of the result codes used with the LDAPv3 protocol. Of particular importance
    are the error codes, which represent the majority of the result codes. This document
    provides definitions for each result code, and outlines the expected behaviour
    of the various operations with respect to how result codes and in particular,
    error conditions should be handled and which specific error code should be returned.
    The LDAPv3 RFC [RFC2251] states that 'An LDAP server MUST act in accordance with
    the X.500(1993) series of ITU recommendations when providing the service. However,
    it is not required that an LDAP server make use of any X.500 protocols in providing
    this service, e.g. LDAP can be mapped onto any other directory system so long
    as the X.500 data and service model as used in LDAP is not violated in the LDAP
    interface.' The goal of this document is to transfer the applicable information
    from X.511 to this document, and expand upon it for LDAP.</p>"
