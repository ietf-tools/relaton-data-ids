abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) has become the global standard in any computer
    network, independent of the connectivity to the Internet. Generally, an IP address
    is used to identify an interface on a network device. Routing protocols are also
    required and developed based on the assumption that a destination address has
    this semantic with routing decisions made on addresses and additional fields in
    the packet headers. Over time, routing decisions were enhanced to route packets
    according to additional information carried within the packets and dependent on
    policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers. Many proposals have
    been made to add semantics to IP addresses. The intent is usually to facilitate
    routing decisions based solely on the address and without the need to find and
    process information carried in other fields within the packets. This document
    is presented as a survey to support the study and further research into clarifying
    and understanding the issues. It does not pass comment on the advisability or
    practicality of any of the proposals and does not define any technical solutions</p>"
