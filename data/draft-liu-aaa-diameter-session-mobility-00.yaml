abstract:
- content: "<p>A mobile node will change its access router frequently during a Diameter
    session and the relevant AAA parameters may also be transferred between the access
    routers. However, the home AAA server does not know the movement of the mobile
    node before the mobile node re-authenticates, and a request from the home AAA
    server will always be forwarded to the former realm. Therefore, an efficient way
    is needed to forward the request to the new access router.</p>"
