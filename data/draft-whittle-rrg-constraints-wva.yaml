abstract:
- content: "<p>This ID will contain a version of my attempt to list the constraints
    the RRG faces in choosing a scalable routing solution due to the need for widespread
    voluntary adoption. This ID is to support and document the IRTF Routing Research
    Group discussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010. It is not a formal
    product of the RRG. To what extent its contents are supported by RRG consensus
    can only be determined by the co-chairs.</p>"
