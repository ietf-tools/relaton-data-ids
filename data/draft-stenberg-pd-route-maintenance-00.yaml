abstract:
- content: "<p>The maintenance of Prefix Delegation (PD) routing state is an issue
    that people have discussed in the IETF DHC WG, and there have been drafts on the
    topic. However, as the pros and cons of the different routing state maintenance
    solutions have not been examined thoroughly, this text attempts to shed some light
    on both the actual problem and the various alternative solutions.</p>"
