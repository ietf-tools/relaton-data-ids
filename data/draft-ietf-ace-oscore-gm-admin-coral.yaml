abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    can be secured using Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (Group OSCORE). A Group Manager is responsible to handle the joining of new group
    members, as well as to manage and distribute the group keying material. The Group
    Manager can provide a RESTful admin interface that allows an Administrator entity
    to create and delete OSCORE groups, as well as to retrieve and update their configuration.
    This document specifies how an Administrator interacts with the admin interface
    at the Group Manager by using the Constrained RESTful Application Language (CoRAL).
    The ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization is used to enforce authentication
    and authorization of the Administrator at the Group Manager. Protocol-specific
    transport profiles of ACE are used to achieve communication security, proof-of-possession,
    and server authentication.</p>"
