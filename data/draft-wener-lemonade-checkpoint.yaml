abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an IMAP extension that aids in allowing a client
    to maintain mailbox synchronization without performing a deep sync after each
    connection. The goal is to minimize, but not eliminate, the need for deep synchronizations.
    The extension defines a way for a client to receive and acknowledge state change
    responses from the server.</p>"
