abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers. When
    all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, and the request can't be found
    in the cache, during a period of time the caching DNS resolvers won't query the
    authoritative name servers, but directly return a SERVFAIL to the clients to reduce
    the recursive name server load and the network load.</p>"
