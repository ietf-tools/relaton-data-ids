abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for a policy information model
    that should help service providers in dynamically provisioning IP Virtual Private
    Networks (VPN). From this perspective, this draft aims at identifying the basic
    capabilities that need to be supported by an IP VPN service offering and thus
    reflected in an IP VPN policy information model, so that IP VPN networks may be
    dynamically deployed according to the corresponding configuration information.</p>"
