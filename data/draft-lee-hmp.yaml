abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a Hotspot Mitigation Protocol (HMP) for mobile
    ad hoc networks that use on-demand routing protocols and the IEEE 802.11 MAC.
    Hotspots represent transient but highly congested regions in wireless ad hoc networks
    that result in increased packet loss, end-to-end delay, and out-of-order packets
    delivery. Using HMP, mobile nodes independently monitor local conditions (e.g.,
    buffer occupancy, packet loss, and MAC contention and delay) in a fully distributed
    manner, and take local actions in response to the emergence of hotspots, such
    as, suppressing new route requests and rate controlling TCP flows. As a result,
    HMP improves end-to-end throughput, delay, and packet loss, balances the resource
    consumption among neighboring nodes, and finally, improves the network connectivity
    by preventing premature network partitions.</p>"
