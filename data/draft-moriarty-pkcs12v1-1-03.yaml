abstract:
- content: '<p>This document represents a republication of PKCS #12 v1.1 (Republication)
    From RSA Laboratories'' Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) series. Change
    control is transferred to the IETF, and generally all rights in the copyright
    are hereby assigned from RSA to IETF, except that RSA reserves the internal right
    to continue publishing, with the right to modify, and distributing the Republication
    and its predecessors internally to RSA and its parent company EMC, including the
    right to make modifications to the Republication and its predecessors (the "RSA
    Internal Right"). For avoidance of doubt, RSA''s Internal Right includes the right
    to post on its public website for use by other parties. The body of this document,
    except for the security considerations section, is taken directly from the PKCS
    #12 v1.1 specification. The list of references and the in-line cites have been
    updated or added where appropriate to cite the most current documents in addition
    to those current at the original publication of PKCS #12 v1.1. PKCS #12 v1.1 describes
    a transfer syntax for personal identity information, including private keys, certificates,
    miscellaneous secrets, and extensions. Machines, applications, browsers, Internet
    kiosks, and so on, that support this standard will allow a user to import, export,
    and exercise a single set of personal identity information. This standard supports
    direct transfer of personal information under several privacy and integrity modes.</p>'
