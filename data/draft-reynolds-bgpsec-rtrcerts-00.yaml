abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
    the purposes of supporting validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths in the Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that protocol known as BGPSEC.
    BGP is a critical component for the proper operation of the Internet as a whole.
    The BGPSEC protocol is under development as a component to address the requirement
    to provide security for the BGP protocol. The goal of BGPSEC is to design a protocol
    for full AS path validation based on the use of strong cryptographic primitives.
    The end-entity (EE) certificates specified by this profile are issued under Resource
    PKI (RPKI) CA certificates, containing the RFC 3779 AS number extension, to routers
    within the autonomous system. The certificate asserts that the router(s) holding
    the public key are authorized to send out secure route advertisements on behalf
    of the specified autonomous system. Note that since these certificates extend
    the RPKI [ID.sidr-arch], this profile is based on the profile for RPKI resource
    certificates [ID.res-cert-prof].</p>"
