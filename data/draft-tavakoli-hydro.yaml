abstract:
- content: "<p>HYDRO is a hybrid routing protocol for Lossy and Low power Networks
    (L2Ns) that embraces centralized and distributed routing mechanisms. Through the
    use of standard ICMP Route Advertisements and Route Solicitations, Node Routers
    build Default Routes to Border Routers. These routes, which maintain multiple
    options per each Node Router when available, are maintained through data-driven
    link estimation. Node Routers periodically report a high-quality subset of their
    Default Route Table to Border Routers, which then form a global view of the topology.
    When a Node Router attempts to route to another Node Router in the network, if
    no matching entry exists in the Node Router's Flow Table, it forwards the packet
    to a Border Router, which then installs the correct Flow Table Entries in the
    network to enable more efficient subsequent routing.</p>"
