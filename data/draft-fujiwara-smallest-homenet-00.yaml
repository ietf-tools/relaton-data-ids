abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to describe a configuration difficulty of complex
    networks and two example solutions. Although access control for home servers is
    very important, managements and setups of access controls are difficult for ordinary
    users. One of solutions is to limit smallest home network inside a L2 link and
    the smallest home network uses link-local address only. The other solutions uses
    ULA (Unique Local Address).</p>"
