abstract:
- content: "<p>For restrict use of Domain Name System (DNS) for domain names with
    alphanumeric characters only, there needs a way to find an Internet host using
    multi-lingual domain names: Internationalized Domain Name System (IDNS). This
    document describes how multi-lingual domain names are handled in a new protocol
    scheme for IDNS servers and resolvers in architectural view and it updates the
    [RFC1035] but still preserves the backward compatibility with the current DNS
    protocol.</p>"
