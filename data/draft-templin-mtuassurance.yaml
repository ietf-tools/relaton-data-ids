abstract:
- content: "<p>IP-in-IP tunnels present a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to layer
    3 via static prearrangements and/or dynamic MTU determination based on layer 2
    ICMP messages, but these methods have known operational limitations that can fail
    to enforce an assured MTU resulting in degraded performance and communications
    failures. A method for providing an assured MTU to layer 3 over IP-in-IP tunnels
    is needed.</p>"
