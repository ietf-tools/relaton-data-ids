abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a signaling protocol for secure
    communication, mobility, and multihoming that introduces a cryptographic namespace.
    This document specifies an extension for HIP that enables middleboxes to unambiguously
    verify the identities of hosts that communicate across them. This extension allows
    middleboxes to verify the liveness and freshness of a HIP association and, thus,
    to secure access control in middleboxes.</p>"
