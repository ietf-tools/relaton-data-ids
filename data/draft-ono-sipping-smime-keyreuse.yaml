abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP User Agent uses Secure MIME (S/MIME) Cryptographic Message
    Syntax (CMS) EnvelopedData to protect SIP messages for confidentiality. While
    SIP messages can be encrypted with different keying materials for each message
    in a dialog, it usually requires a public key operation for each message and the
    computational cost of such operations are relatively expensive. This draft proposes
    a method of bidirectional key exchange to reuse keying materials for S/MIME-secured
    messages in a dialog and use a symmetric key mechanism instead of an asymmetric
    key mechanism such as a public key operation. The proposed mechanism also achieves
    the sharing of keying material among multiple entities simply.</p>"
