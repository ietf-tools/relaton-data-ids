abstract:
- content: "<p>As human activity continues to spread beyond the Earth, so must the
    communications systems which support that activity continue to expand in scope.
    One such case, Internet naming, presents particular challenges when considering
    a multi-planet civilization. Proper operation of terrestrial DNS services and
    clients require constant, reasonably low latency connectivity to operate properly.
    These conditions are distinctly not present when considering interplanetary links;
    high latency and frequent disruption due to space weather events and general link
    availability prevail. To overcome these challenges in space networking, a delay
    and distruption tolerant (DTN) suite of protocols has been developed based on
    a store and forward mechanism, Bundle Protocol(BP). This DTN network, which optimizes
    to ensure bundle delivery, does not allow for end to end encapsulation of IP packets
    beyond terrestrial boundaries, as the latency still creates issues completing
    network transactions, even in the unlikely event of continuous link availability.</p>"
