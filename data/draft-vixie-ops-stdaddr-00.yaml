abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft enumerates and describes standard electronic mail addresses
    to be used when contacting the operations personnel of an arbitrary domain. As
    an operational standard, the recommendations herein pertain to vendors only inasmuch
    as their end user documentation should recommend that these mail addresses be
    aliased to appropriate end user personnel. This document should be advanced as
    a Best Current Practice, since it describes what the current practice is and should
    be.</p>"
