abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8955 defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability
    Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute (intra-domain
    and inter-domain) traffic Flow Specifications for IPv4 unicast and IPv4 BGP/MPLS
    VPN services. This allows the routing system to propagate information regarding
    more specific components of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination
    prefix. It also specifies BGP Extended Community encoding formats, which can be
    used to propagate Traffic Filtering Actions along with the Flow Specification
    NLRI. Those Traffic Filtering Actions encode actions a routing system can take
    if the packet matches the Flow Specification. This document extends RFC 8955 with
    New traffic Filtering Actions. statistic for bytes rate per second and statistic
    for packets rate per second are useful in specified Flow processing scenario.</p>"
