abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an investigation of how some common mailers (Eudora,
    Pine, Hotmail, Outlook Express, Netscape, First Class, KOM 2000) handled the use
    of multipart/alternative with different languages in the different body parts.
    None of the mailers handled this very well. It seems as if none of the mailers
    can actually choose the part in the language preferred by the user. Some of them
    displayed all language parts, some arbitrarily chose to display only one part.
    The study compares different methods of specifying language translation in e-mail,
    but finds that no format seems to give satisfactory results with all the tested
    mailers.</p>"
