abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports findings in the availability and operational
    performance of the client side translator (CLAT) feature within 464XLAT as defined
    in [RFC6877]. It also identifies remaining issues in providing ubiquitous and
    efficient CLAT support on a global scale. Since publication in April 2013, 464XLAT
    has made a significant impact on mobile networks wishing to implement endpoints
    purely with IPv6. This has allowed the IPv6 Internet to expand dramatically as
    well as increase IPv6 deployments across wireline and enterprise- style networks.</p>"
