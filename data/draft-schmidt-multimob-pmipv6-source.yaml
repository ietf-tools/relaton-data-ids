abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains
    by deploying MLD Proxy functions at Mobile Access Gateways and multicast routing
    functions at Local Mobility Anchors, or by additional route optimization schemes.
    This document describes the support of mobile multicast senders in Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 domains that is provided by this base deployment scenario, as well as in
    settings of further optimization. Mobile sources remain agnostic of multicast
    mobility operations.</p>"
