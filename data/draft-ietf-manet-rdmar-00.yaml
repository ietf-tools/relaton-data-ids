abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Relative Distance Micro-discovery Ad Hoc
    Routing (RDMAR) protocol for use in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The protocol
    is highly adaptive, bandwidth-efficient and scaleable. A key concept in its design
    is that protocol reaction to link failures is typically localised to a very small
    region of the network near the change. This desirable behaviour is achieved through
    the use of a novel mechanism for route discovery, called Relative Distance Micro-discovery
    (RDM). The concept behind RDM is that a query flood can be localised by knowing
    the relative distance (RD) between two terminals. To accomplish this, every time
    a route search between the two terminals is triggered, an iterative algorithm
    calculates an estimate of their RD, given an average nodal mobility and information
    about the elapsed time since they last communicated and their previous RD. Based
    on the newly calculated RD, the query flood is then localised to a limited region
    of the network centred at the source node of the route discovery and with maximum
    propagation radius that equals to the estimated relative distance. This ability
    to localise query flooding into a limited area of the network serves to increase
    scalability and minimise routing overhead and overall network congestion.</p>"
