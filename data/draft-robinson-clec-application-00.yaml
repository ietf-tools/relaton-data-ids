abstract:
- content: "<p>This document shows an application to obtain a permit to operate a
    telephone company. This was included as an internet-draft because of the common
    use of telephone connections for dial-up internet service and thus may be of interest
    to the Internet community. The actual tariff schedules as filed as part of this
    application will be included as a later internet-draft.</p>"
