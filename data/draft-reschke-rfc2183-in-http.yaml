abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP/1.1 defines the Content-Disposition response header field, but
    points out that it is not part of the HTTP/1.1 Standard. This specification takes
    over the definition and registration of Content- Disposition, as used in HTTP,
    and clarifies internationalization aspects.</p>"
