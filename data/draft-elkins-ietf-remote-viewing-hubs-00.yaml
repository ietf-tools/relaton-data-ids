abstract:
- content: "<p>For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has increased.
    As the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide. Remote
    participation with more than one person is considered a hub. Three types of remote
    hubs are defined. Some exist today; other types may exist in the future. Each
    has its own characteristics. - Remote Participation Hubs (future) - Remote Viewing
    Hubs (today) - Enduring Local Meetups (today) This document defines a Remote Viewing
    Hub (RVH). Other documents define the other types of hubs. A common structure
    of sections will be used as far as possible for all hub types.</p>"
