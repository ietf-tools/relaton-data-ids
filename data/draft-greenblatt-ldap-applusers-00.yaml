abstract:
- content: "<p>In working with various directory enabled applications and services,
    it has been noticed that several of them presume the existence of an auxiliary
    object class with no attributes that is used to detect 'their' users. For example,
    the foo application service will use the fooUser object class, and attach this
    object class to all of its user objects in the directory in order that it may
    later on easily detect 'its' users, by virtue of the fact that those users are
    members of the fooUser object class. This fooUser object class is a subclass of
    top with no additional attributes. This specification intends to head off the
    day when a user would get one of these applicationUser object class things attached
    to its directory object for each application that it uses. This would mean that
    that object's object class attribute would eventually have dozens of values, which
    would in turn lessen the value of this attribute.</p>"
