abstract:
- content: "<p>In today's Internet, caching proxies that intermediate between HTTP
    (and increasingly streaming media) clients and servers provide enhanced performance
    for Web page access. Both clients and servers are increasingly looking to the
    network for additional services that can't be provided directly on the client
    or server, and Web proxies are an attractive place for locating these services.
    In fact, some such services (content assembly for advertising) are already being
    offered by Web proxies for servers, but in a nonstandard way. This document describes
    the problem and solution requirements for a standardized, open and extensible
    service environment on caching proxies which enables them to provide general services
    that mediate, modify, and monitor object requests and responses. It introduces
    an architectural framework along with a set of core requirements necessary to
    design standardized implementations for this application domain, taking into account
    relevant IETF RFCs and IETF work-in-progress. The architecture and requirements
    described here are mindful of the success of end-to-end nature of Internet client/server
    interactions, and the consequences of the proposed architectural changes on end-to-end
    semantics are discussed.</p>"
