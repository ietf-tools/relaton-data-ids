abstract:
- content: "<p>In 802.11 or similar technologies, the network device enters a 'cell-search
    mode' when the signal level/quality of the serving AP drops below a certain value.
    In the cell-search mode, the device actively measures the signal level and/or
    quality of neighbouring APs in addition to that of the serving AP. This document
    describes how the use of MN originated cell-search list indications, which carry
    signal level and signal quality measurements of access points in the immediate
    vicinity of the mobile node, can assist in a handover scheme that factors in seamlessness,
    target router selection, context transfer and resource usage information.</p>"
