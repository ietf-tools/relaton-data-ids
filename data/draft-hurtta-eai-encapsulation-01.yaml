abstract:
- content: "<p>The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) is implemented by allowing
    UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers. To deliver email which uses
    UTF-8 in email headers through EAI non- compliant environment converting (i.e
    downgrading) or encapsulation mechanism is required. Some UTF-8 email may sign
    email headers or email header fields. This document describes mechanism for encapsulation
    when converting can not be used because of signed email headers. Encapsulation
    may also be used to forward EAI email through EAI non-compliant environment that
    way that original EAI email can be recovered.</p>"
