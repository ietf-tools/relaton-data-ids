abstract:
- content: "<p>Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines
    for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to support Advanced
    Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart meters for electricity. The inherent
    advantage of existing electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of
    PLC deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible devices raises the
    potential demand of IPv6 for future applications. This document describes how
    IPv6 packets are transported over constrained PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903,
    IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2 and IEEE 1901.2a.</p>"
