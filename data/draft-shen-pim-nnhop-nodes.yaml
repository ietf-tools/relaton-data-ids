- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to PIM-SM in support of next-nexthop
    downstream node discovery. This next-nexthop node information can be used for
    PIM to fast re-route multicast traffic onto explicitly routed tunnels, for downstream
    node protection in case of outbound link or nexthop node failure.</p>"
