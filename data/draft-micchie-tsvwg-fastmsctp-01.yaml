abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)[RFC4960] can support mobility
    by utilizing the multi-home feature and the Dynamic Address Reconfiguration extension
    (ADDIP)[RFC5061]. By leveraging this feature, applications that use SCTP can continue
    communication without terminating it when the mobile node migrates to another
    network. However, the migration of a mobile node often involves connectivity disruption
    due to bad wireless coverage, potential device overhead on the wireless interface
    to switch the wireless network to connect, and configuring a new IP address. The
    connectivity disruption can induce significant delay on the SCTP communications,
    because it causes retransmission time outs (RTOs) for lost packets that are transmitted
    in this period. In order to avoid the delay caused by the RTOs, this document
    describes a new retransmission trigger based on endpoint readdressing events.
    SCTP can minimize the delay caused by migration involving connectivity disruption
    with this retransmission trigger.</p>"
