abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP has a mechanism for conveying the identity of the referrer of a
    request by means of the Referred-By header field. This header field may be used
    when exploding a SIP MESSAGE request to a pre-defined group URI and when exploding
    a SIP INVITE request to an ad-hoc group or to a pre-defined group URI. The Referred-By
    header is only included if the P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header
    field in the exploded SIP requests needs to carry another value, e.g. the URI
    of a pre-defined group, or a conference focus URI. In those cases, the Referred-By
    header field in the resulting exploded requests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity
    header field or to the From header field of the original SIP request received
    before exploding to convey to the receiver the identity of the original inviting
    sender. RFC 3892 restricts the value of the header to only one SIP URI. However
    the P-Asserted-Identity header field currently allows two URI values and may be
    expanded in the future to carry more than two values as described in draft-ietf-sipping-update-pai-09.
    This document extends the Referred-By definition to support more than one value
    as well.</p>"
