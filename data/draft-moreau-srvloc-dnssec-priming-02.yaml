abstract:
- content: "<p>By assigning the SLP (Service Location Protocol, [RFC2608]) UA (User
    Agent) role to a DNS resolver, the present document opens the door to selective
    deployment of DNS root nameservice within an administrative domain. This SLP scheme
    directly addresses the DNS resolver configuration scaling issue. Usage is limited
    to DNSSEC- enabled root nameservice. Moreover, from the SLP security features,
    the proposed scheme expands the set of DNS root trust anchor key rollover options.
    Early DNSSEC support at the rot is made possible with DNSSEC root nameservice
    substitution, as well as later transparent migration to a unique DNSSEC root.</p>"
