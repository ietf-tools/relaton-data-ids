abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the current practices for handling new cryptography
    within the IETF. Some of these practices are informal and depend on individuals
    in certain relevant roles, such as Working Group Chairs, the Security Area Directors
    and the Independent Stream Editor. This document is intended to increase consistency
    and transparency in how the IETF handles new cryptography, such as new algorithms,
    ciphers and new primitives or combiners, by providing a reference for the cryptographic
    practices within the IETF. This document does not describe any new policies and
    does not prohibit exceptions in the described current practices.</p>"
