abstract:
- content: "<p>The establishment of Human Rights as a Service (HRaaS) has significant
    potential benefits. Although the generic expressions of human rights in legal
    instruments largely precludes definitive HRaaS specification, the establishment
    of a measurable objective is compelling in the global marketplace for internet
    capabilities made available to the public, including new virtualised NFV-SDN based
    implementations and protocols. This HRaaS draft provides a structured enumeration
    of human rights found in the principal global legal instruments against which
    standards bodies can evaluate their specifications, vendors can differentiate
    their offerings, and users can compare those offerings and make informed decisions.</p>"
