abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Kademlia-directed ID-based Routing Architecture
    KIRA. KIRA offers highly scalable zero-touch IPv6 connectivity, i.e., it can connect
    hundred thousands of routers and devices in a single network (without requiring
    any form of hierarchy like areas). It is self-organizing to achieve a zero-touch
    solution that provides resilient (control plane) IPv6 connectivity without requiring
    any manual configuration by operators. It works well in various topologies and
    is loop-free even during convergence. The architecture consists of the ID-based
    network layer routing protocol RÂ²/Kad in its routing tier and a Path-ID-based
    forwarding tier. The topological independent IDs can be embedded into IPv6 addresses,
    so that KIRA provides zero-touch IPv6 connectivity between KIRA nodes.</p>"
