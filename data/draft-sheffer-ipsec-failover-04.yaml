abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain
    computational and communication overhead with respect to the number of round-trips
    required and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations,
    the Extensible Authentication Protocol is used for authentication, which adds
    several more round trips and therefore latency. To re-establish security associations
    (SA) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming, especially when an IPsec
    peer, such as a VPN gateway, needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with
    various end points. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause additional
    problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment. In many failure cases it
    would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an interrupted IKE/IPsec
    session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to
    re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing
    a previously established IKE SA. A client can reconnect to a gateway from which
    it was disconnected, or alternatively migrate to another gateway that is associated
    with the previous one. The proposed approach conveys IKEv2 state information,
    in the form of an encrypted ticket, to a VPN client that is later presented to
    the VPN gateway for re-authentication. The encrypted ticket can only be decrypted
    by the VPN gateway in order to restore state for faster session setup.</p>"
