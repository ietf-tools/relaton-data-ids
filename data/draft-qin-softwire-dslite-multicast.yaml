- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for the delivery of multicast service
    offerings to DS-Lite serviced customers. The proposed solution relies upon a stateless
    IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme and does not require performing any NAT operation
    along the path used to deliver multicast traffic.</p>"
