abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the QUALDOCS (QD) protocol. The QD requirements
    are derived from the requirements for Internet Fax [1]. In summary QD is used
    to provide a synchronous, reliable exchange of image documents between clients
    and servers. The primary use envisaged of this protocol is to provide a synchronous
    image transmission service for the Internet. Contrast this with the store and
    forward fax-like protocol specified in [2] and [3]. This document proposes that
    the QD protocol should use an extended version of IPP1.1 [4], [5].</p>"
