abstract:
- content: "<p>Given that an AS collaboration scheme for inter-domain source address
    validation requires an information-sharing platform, this document proposes a
    new approach by leveraging Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) architecture
    to validate the authenticity of source address of packets. Source Address Authorization
    (SOA) is a newly defined cryptographically signed object; it provides a means
    of recording information about the last Autonomous System (AS) traversed by packets
    before reaching a specific AS. When validated, the eContent of an SOA object confirms
    that the holder of the listed AS Number (ASN) has authorized the specified pre-ASes.
    This enables other ASes to collaboratively filter spoofed traffic, enhancing global
    Internet security by mitigating source address spoofing and DDoS attacks.</p>"
