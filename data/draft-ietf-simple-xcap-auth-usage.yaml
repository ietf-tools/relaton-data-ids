abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes three usages of the Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) that allow a client to provide authorization
    decisions regarding watchers of their presence. The first of these usages, called
    permission-statements, contains statements about what permissions are to be granted
    to watchers of presence. The second of these usages, called compound-permissions,
    allows a client to define new permissions as combinations of other defined permissions.
    The third usage, called supported-permissions, allows a client to determine what
    permissions are understood by the provider.</p>"
