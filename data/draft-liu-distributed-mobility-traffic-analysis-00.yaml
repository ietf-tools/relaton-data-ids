    and more closer to the network edge. The motivation of this trend comes from several

    flatten network architecture. In this scenario, mobility solution needed to be
    studied to fit for the flatten network. This document analysis the benefit of
    distributing mobility anchor to the network edge from the traffic load pespective.</p>"
