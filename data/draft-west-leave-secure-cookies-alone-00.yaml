abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC6265 by removing the ability for a non- secure
    origin to set cookies with a 'secure' flag, and to overwrite cookies whose 'secure'
    flag is set. This deprecation improves the isolation between HTTP and HTTPS origins,
    and reduces the risk of malicious interference.</p>"
