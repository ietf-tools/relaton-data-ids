abstract:
- content: "<p>*This version of the document is aimed to be a base reference point
    to compare against to see how YANG Push Lite compares to the two core RFCs [RFC8639]
    &amp; [RFC8641] that it is based on. The next draft revision would serve as a
    better starting point to see the proposed protocol &amp; data model for YANG Push
    Lite.* YANG Push Lite is a simplified specification of YANG Push, specifically
    optimized for observability of operational data. This early draft proposes some
    enhancements to YANG-Push to optimize its behavior for operational data telemetry.
    It also lists some additional issues that could potentially be discussed if there
    is further interest in this work, in particular whether we should be attempting
    extensions to YANG-Push (as this document is currently framed) or instead should
    attempt to define a new 'YANG-Push lite'.</p>"
