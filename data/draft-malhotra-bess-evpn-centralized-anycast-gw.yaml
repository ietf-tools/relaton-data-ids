abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) fabrics provide a flexible
    and extensible method for Layer-2 and Layer-3 overlay network connectivity. [EVPN-IRB]
    defines operation for symmetric and asymmetric EVPN IRB using distributed anycast
    gateway architecture (DAG). In a DAG architecture, both bridging and first-hop
    routing functions for overlay subnets are located on leaf PEs, with first-hop
    routing provided by a distributed anycast gateway provisioned across the leaf
    PEs. This document describes an architecture and operation for EVPN Centralized
    Anycast Gateway (CAG), which allows the first- hop routing function for overlay
    subnets to be centralized on designated IRB GWs while the bridging function is
    still located on the leaf PEs. The documents also covers trade-offs of deploying
    a CAG as compared with DAG. It further describes operation for inter- op between
    CAG and DAG based EVPN-IRB network overlays.</p>"
