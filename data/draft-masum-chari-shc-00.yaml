abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple enterprises (tenants) consuming resources in a public Cloud
    shares the physical infrastructure of one or more DCs out of which the Cloud resources
    are serviced. Hence one of the major features that has to be supported in public
    Cloud DCs is multitenant isolation, which is realized via various DC isolation
    technologies, such as VLAN or VxLAN. In a hybrid Cloud environment where a public
    Cloud (more specifically off-premises public Cloud resources acquired by a tenant
    ) becomes an _extension_ of a tenant intranet or private Cloud, the multitenant
    isolation capability has to be extended beyond the public Cloud DCs. The multitenant
    isolation _domain_ has to span end-to-end from the tenant network or on-premises
    resources via the MAN/WAN and the public Cloud DC networks to tenant off-premises
    resources. While multitenant isolationI isolates one tenant from another (inter-hybrid
    Cloud isolation), an enterprise may desire controlled connectivity to a hybrid
    Cloud from another Cloud or network or tenant or select resources. In addition,
    there may be need for controlling direct reachability of resources within a hybrid
    Cloud itself (intra-hybrid Cloud). The tenant network may be connected to the
    public Cloud (DCs) over the Internet or a private IP/MPLS MAN/WAN owned or operated
    by a service provider, which also may support PPVPN (Provider Provided VPN) service,
    such as the L3 MPLS VPN. In this work we consider the latter type of network and
    describe a framework for supporting inter-hybrid Cloud multitenant isolation,
    inter-hybrid Cloud connectivity and intra-hybrid Cloud reachability.</p>"
