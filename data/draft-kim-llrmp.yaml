abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the LLRMP, a link level signalling protocol used
    to setup resources in shared-medium and bridged/switched LANs. Network layer resource
    management protocols like RSVP or STII, or a local network manager, may invoke
    the LLRMP to request a certain quality of service over a bridged LAN. The LLRMP
    protocol supports a distributed admission control over bridged LANs. Resources
    are reserved independently on each segment, on a hop-by-hop basis, as a LLRMP
    reservation message travels along the data path from the source to the receiver.</p>"
