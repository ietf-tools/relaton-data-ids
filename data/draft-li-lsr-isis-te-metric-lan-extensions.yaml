abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, network-performance criteria (e.g., latency) are
    becoming as critical to data-path selection as other metrics. This document describes
    extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions (RFC 8570) for
    LAN subnetworks. These extensions provide a way to distribute and collect network-performance
    information in LAN subnetworks.</p>"
