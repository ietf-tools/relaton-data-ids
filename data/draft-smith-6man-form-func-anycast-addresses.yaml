abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, IPv6 anycast addresses are chosen from within the existing
    IPv6 unicast address space, with the addresses nominated as anycast addresses
    through configuration. An alternative scheme would be to have a special class
    of addresses for use as anycast addresses. This memo proposes a distinct general
    anycast addressing class for IPv6, and a more specific scheme for functional anycast
    addresses.</p>"
