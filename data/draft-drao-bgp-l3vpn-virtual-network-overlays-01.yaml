abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual network overlays are being designed and deployed in various
    types of networks, including data centers. These network overlays address several
    requirements including flexible network virtualization and multi-tenancy, increased
    scale, and support for mobility of virtual machines. Such overlay networks can
    be used to provide both Layer-2 and Layer-3 network services to hosts at the network
    edge. New packet encapsulations are being defined and standardized to support
    these virtual networks. These encapsulations, such as VXLAN and NVGRE, are primarily
    based on IP and are currently defined to support a Layer-2 forwarding service.
    BGP based Layer-3 VPNs, as specified in RFC 4364, provide an industry proven and
    well-defined solution for supporting Layer-3 virtual network services. However,
    RFC 4364 procedures use MPLS labels to provide the network virtualization capability
    in the data plane. With the increasing support for IP overlay encapsulations in
    data center devices, there is a strong preference to utilize this support to deploy
    Layer-3 virtual networks using the familiarpolicy and operational primitives of
    Layer-3 VPNs. This document describes the use of BGP Layer-3 VPNs alongwith the
    new IP-based virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide a Layer-3 virtualization
    solution for all IP traffic, and specifies mechanisms to use the new encapsulations
    while continuing to leverage the BGP Layer-3 VPN control plane techniques and
    extensions. This mechanism provides an efficient incremental solution to support
    forwarding for IP traffic, irrespective of whether it is destined within or across
    an IP subnet boundary.</p>"
