abstract:
- content: "<p>Routes for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the LSP crosses
    multiple domains such as Autonomous Systems (ASs) the path may be computed by
    multiple PCEs that cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment of
    the path. However, in some cases such as when ASs are administered by separate
    Service Providers, it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE to supply a
    path segment to a PCE in another domain. This issue may be circumvented by returning
    a loose hop and by invoking a new path computation from the domain boundary LSR
    during LSP setup as the LSP enters the second domain, but this technique has several
    issues including the problem of maintaining path diversity. This document allows
    a PCE to provide a full path, but to hide the contents of a segment of that path
    called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS). The CPS may be conveyed in the PCE
    Communication Protocol (PCEP) and signaled in a Resource Reservation Protocol
    (RSVP) explicit route either by replacing it with a path key or by encrypting
    it.</p>"
