abstract:
- content: "<p>Web-based malware and attacks are proliferating rapidly on the Internet.
    New web security mechanisms are also rapidly growing in number, although in an
    incoherent fashion. This document provides a brief overview of the present situation
    and the various seemingly piece-wise approaches being taken to mitigate the threats.
    It then provides an overview of requirements as presently being expressed by the
    community in various online and face-to-face discussions.</p>"
