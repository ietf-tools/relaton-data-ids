abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol almost exclusively
    used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.
    Due to this central nature, it is important to understand the security and reliability
    measures that can and should be deployed to prevent accidental or intentional
    routing disturbances. Previously, security considerations for BGP have been described
    in RFC7454 / BCP194. Since the publications of RFC7454 / BCP194, several developments
    and changes in operational practice took place that warrant an update of these
    best current practices. This document replaces RFC7454 / BCP194, reiterating the
    best practices for BGP security from that document and adding new practices and
    recommendations that emerged since its publication. This document provides a comprehensive
    list of Internet specific BGP security and reliability related best practices
    as of the time of publication. It specifically does not cover other uses of BGP,
    e.g., in a datacenter context. While the recommendations in this document are,
    in general, best practices, operators still need to carefully weigh individual
    measures vs. their local network requirements before implementing them. Also,
    as with BCP194, best practices outlined in this document may have changed since
    its publication.</p>"
