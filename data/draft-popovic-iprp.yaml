abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable packet delivery within stringent delay-constraints is of paramount
    importance to mission-critical computer applications with hard real-time constraints.
    Because retransmission and coding techniques counteract the delay requirements,
    reliability may be achieved through replication over multiple fail-independent
    paths. Existing solutions, such as the parallel redundancy protocol (PRP), replicate
    all packets at the MAC layer over parallel paths. PRP works best in local area
    networks. However, it is not viable for IP networks that are a key element of
    emerging mission-critical systems. This limitation, coupled with diagnostic inability
    and lack of security, renders PRP unsuitable for reliable data-delivery in these
    IP networks. To address this issue, we present a transport-layer solution: the
    IP parallel redundancy protocol (iPRP). Designing iPRP poses non-trivial challenges
    in the form of selective packet- replication, soft-state and multicast support.
    iPRP replicates only time-critical unicast or multicast UDP traffic. iPRP requires
    no modifications to the existing monitoring application, end-device operating
    system or to the intermediate network devices. It only requires a simple software
    installation on the end-devices. iPRP has a set of diagnostic tools for network
    debugging. With our implementation of iPRP in Linux, we show that iPRP supports
    multiple flows with minimal processing-and-delay overhead. It is being installed
    in our campus smart-grid network and is publicly available.</p>"
