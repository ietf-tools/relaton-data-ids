abstract:
- content: "<p>This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of nodes and
    links in segment routing to represent networks in an opaque way for further extensibility
    of the link-state protocols that help with segment routing. An instance of the
    opaque definition would be optical networks that are typically transport centric.
    In the IP centric network, this will help in defining a common control protocol
    for packet optical integration that will include optical paths as opaque 'segments'
    or sub-paths as an augmentation to the defined extensions of segment routing.
    This opaque option defines a general mechanism to allow for future extensibility
    of segment routing.</p>"
