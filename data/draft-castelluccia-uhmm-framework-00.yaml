abstract:
- content: "<p>As the number of Mobile Nodes increases in the Internet, it becomes
    clear that a hierarchical mobility management protocol is necessary. The macro-mobility
    is the mobility between domains. The micro- mobility is the mobility within one
    domain. Several proposals that separate macro and micro-mobility has been proposed
    recently (CellularIP[4], HAWAI[3], HMIP[1],...).</p>"
