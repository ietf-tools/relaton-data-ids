abstract:
- content: "<p>Intermediate data formats (IDFs), also known as external data formats
    or data-interchange formats, are used to exchange data between networked applications.
    Example formats are JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Abstract Syntax Notation
    One (ASN.1). IDFs are ubiquitous in networking. Despite their importance, there's
    remarkably little written guidance about how to actually design or architect an
    IDF. This guidance gap exists despite fifty years of experience designing and
    deploying IDFs, going back to the days of ARPANET. As a result, even recently
    developed IDFs have obvious flaws that could have been avoided. The purpose of
    this memo is to provide basic basic guidance about how to design an IDF. This
    memo is NOT the product of any IETF or IRTF working group.</p>"
