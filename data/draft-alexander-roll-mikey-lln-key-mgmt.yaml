abstract:
- content: "<p>Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol used
    for real-time applications. As standardized within RFC3830 it defines four key
    distribution methods, including pre-shared keys, public-key encryption, and Diffie-Hellman
    key exchange, with allowances for ready protocol extension. A number of additional
    methods have been developed and continue to be built from the base protocol (see
    for example, RFC4442, RFC4563, RFC4650, RFC4738, RFC5410, RFC6043 and RFC6267.
    However, in spite of its extensibility and more general applicability, MIKEY and
    its related extensions have primarily focused on the support of the Secure Real-time
    Transport Protocol (SRTP). This document specifies a simple adaptation of the
    MIKEY specification to allow the base protocol and its various key management
    mode extensions to be readily applied in more general environments beyond the
    multimedia SRTP domain. In particular, the document defines a repurposing of the
    MIKEY multimedia crypto sessions structure and introduces a set of message extensions
    to the base specification to allow the MIKEY key management methods to be applied
    within Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) and other general constrained-device
    networks.</p>"
