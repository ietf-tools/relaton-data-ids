abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF [Ref1] is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used for
    routing in IP networks. Though the definition of the ABR in the current OSPF specification
    does not require a router with multiple attached areas to have a backbone connection,
    it is actually necessary to provide successful routing to the inter-area and external
    destinations. If this requirement is not met all traffic, destined for the areas
    not connected to such ab ABR or out of the OSPF domain, is dropped. The rules
    of originating and processing Summary-LSAs given in the current OSPF standard
    [Ref1] can also result in suboptimal inter-area routing. Though all these problems
    can be fixed using virtual links, this memo describes an alternative implementation
    of the OSPF ABR behavior, which allows the administrator to avoid it or, if virtual
    links are still used, to decrease the number of configured virtual links. This
    memo also describes possible situations where the proposed implementation can
    be used.</p>"
