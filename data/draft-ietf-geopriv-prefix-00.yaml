abstract:
- content: <p>RFC4119 updated by RFC5139 defines suffixes for street names and house
    numbers, but does not define prefixes. Both occur regularly in addresses and CAtypes
    are needed for them. This memo defines STP Street Prefix and HNP house number
    prefix CAtypes. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in
