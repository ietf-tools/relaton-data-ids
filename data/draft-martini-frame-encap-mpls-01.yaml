abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines frame relay pseudo-wire emulation edge-to-edge.
    A frame relay pseudo-wire is a mechanism that exists between a provider's edge
    network nodes and support as faithfully as possible frame relay services over
    IP and MPLS packet switched network (PSN). Two mapping modes are defined: One-to-one
    mapping mode characterized by a one to one relationship between a frame relay
    VC and a pair of MPLS LSPs is defined for MPLS PSN. The other mode is known as
    port mode or many-to-one mapping mode and is defined for MPLS PSN and IP PSN with
    L2TPv3.</p>"
