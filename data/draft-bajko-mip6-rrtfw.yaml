abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a slightly modified Return Routability Test (RRT)
    for MIPv6 [RFC3775]. The herein defined RRT mechanism is intended for CoA exchanges
    between the MN and the CN. Once the MN and CN find out their peers' valid addresses,
    an additional mechanism, defined in [I-D.tschofenig-mip6-ice], will be used to
    run connectivity checks to figure out which of the address pairs have connectivity
    and, if needed, open the required pinholes in the firewalls as described in [4].
    The defined mechanism is intended to work with current firewalls without requiring
    any support from them.</p>"
