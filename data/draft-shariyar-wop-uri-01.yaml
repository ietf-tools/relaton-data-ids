abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Uniform Resource Identifiers for Physical Objects
    and human.It provides a proposal for the implementation of the Concept, ”Physical
    resources as well as humans should be accessible over the Internet and an information
    object is on the web if it can have a URI ”. It emphasizes on the fact that people
    should be able to access the physical resources,they possess or even humans,from
    anywhere in the world through a common standard(URI) e.g. accessing a car from
    a remote location,or finding the location of the child via URI.As URIs are needed
    in RDF,XML,so by using them for ubiquitous resources we could easily integrate
    the world of ubiquitous computing and semantic web i.e. Ubiquitous Semantic Web.</p>"
