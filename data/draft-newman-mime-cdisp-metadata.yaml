abstract:
- content: "<p>The Content-Disposition [CDISP] header defines two disposition types:
    ``inline'' and ``attachment'' which can affect presentation of a MIME [MIME-IMB]
    body part. There have been a number of cases where one MIME body part is ancillary
    or contains meta-data for another MIME body part and is neither suitable for inline
    display by itself, nor is it useful if treated as an independent attachment and
    saved to a file by itself. If the recipient UA is not familiar with the specific
    media type, the user often is presented with a useless unrecognizable attachment.
    This memo proposes a third disposition type, ``ancillary'', to address this situation.</p>"
