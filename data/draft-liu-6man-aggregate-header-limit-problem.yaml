abstract:
- content: <p>This document first proposes introduces the concept "Aggregate header
    limit for IPv6"(AHL-IPv6) based on RFC8883 to indicate the total header size that
    a router is able to process at full forwarding rate for IPv6 packets. Then this
    document describes the problems for path calculation and function enablement without
    the awareness of AHL- IPv6, and the considerations for AHL-IPv6 collection are
    also included.</p>
