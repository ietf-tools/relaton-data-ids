abstract:
- content: "<p>Route Leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate assumptions
    of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route learned from one peer to another
    peer or to a transit provider, passing a route learned from one transit provider
    to another transit provider or to a peer. Today, approaches to leak prevention
    rely on marking routes according to operator configuration options without any
    check that the configuration corresponds to that of the BGP neighbor, or enforcement
    that the two BGP speakers agree on the relationship. This document enhances BGP
    Open to establish agreement of the (peer, customer, provider, internal) relationship
    of two neighboring BGP speakers to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides.
    Propagated routes are then marked with an iOTC attribute according to agreed relationship
    allowing prevention of route leaks.</p>"
