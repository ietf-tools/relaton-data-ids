abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the potential benefits to applications when
    they enable Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). It outlines the principal
    gains in terms of increased throughput, reduced delay and other benefits when
    ECN is used over network paths that include equipment that supports ECN-marking.
    The focus of this document is on usage of ECN, not its implementation in hosts,
    routers and other network devices.</p>"
