abstract:
- content: "<p>With the current evolution toward wireless data, wireless internet,
    and wireless multimedia applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing,
    and Video telephony, similar performance requirements to those of existing circuit
    switched or voice based wireless systems are essential to the success of this
    evolution. Among these performance requirements are the call setup time, delay,
    reliability, and Quality of Service (QoS). To ensure QoS, provide faster call
    setup time, and reduce the number of RSVP messaging across the network; this note
    introduces the concept and describes the use of bi-directional RSVP (B- RSVP)
    resource reservation protocol with both Controlled-Load and Guaranteed QoS control
    services. While RSVP allows for uni-directional resource reservations only in
    the 'send' direction, B-RSVP protocol generalizes the process by allowing simultaneous
    bi-directional (send and receive) resource reservations on each hop. B-RSVP also
    allows for a reverse route (receive only) uni-directional resource reservation.
    B- RSVP is most suitable for applications in which the originator of a service
    is solely responsible for making the necessary reservations and their cost. This
    note defines several data objects that carry resource reservation information
    required for both send and receive traffic. The proposed message formats are extensions
    to existing RSVP messages and totally backward compatible. The usage and data
    format of those objects are described herein.</p>"
