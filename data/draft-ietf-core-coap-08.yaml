abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
    a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained networks and nodes
    for machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy and building automation.
    These constrained nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of
    ROM and RAM, while networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates
    and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. CoAP provides a method/response interaction
    model between application end-points, supports built-in resource discovery, and
    includes key web concepts such as URIs and content-types. CoAP easily translates
    to HTTP for integration with the web while meeting specialized requirements such
    as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments.</p>"
