abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how the elliptic curve secure remote protocol
    (EC-SRP) is applied to SIP authentication. SIP Client and server perform mutual
    authenticate by using the modern 'zero knowledge' method without disclosing the
    password in the process. It has low computation complexity and low bandwidth consumption
    due to the use of elliptical curve cryptography. This makes it more suitable for
    resource-constrained environments,e.g. wireless network. The security of the scheme
    is based on the computational intractability of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm
    problem. It is resilient to various kinds of attacks, including off-line dictionary
    attacks.</p>"
