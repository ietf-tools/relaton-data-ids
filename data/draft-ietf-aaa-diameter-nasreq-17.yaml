abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for
    Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network Access
    Server (NAS) environment. When combined with the Diameter Base protocol, Transport
    Profile, and Extensible Authentication Protocol specifications, this application
    specification satisfies typical network access services requirements. Initial
    deployments of the Diameter protocol are expected to include legacy systems. Therefore,
    this application has been carefully designed to ease the burden of protocol conversion
    between RADIUS and Diameter. This is achieved by including the RADIUS attribute
    space to eliminate the need to perform many attribute translations. The interactions
    between Diameter applications and RADIUS specified in this document are to be
    applied to all Diameter applications. In this sense, this document extends the
    Base Diameter protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
