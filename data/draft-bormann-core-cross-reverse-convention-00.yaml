abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    In many applications, CoAP will be used via cross-protocol proxies from HTTP clients.
    HTTP client libraries may make it hard to operate an HTTP-CoAP forward proxy by
    not providing a way to put a CoAP URI on the HTTP Request-Line; reverse-proxying
    may therefore lead to wider applicability of a proxy. This specification will
    define a convention for URIs operating such a HTTP-CoAP reverse proxy. The current
    version of this specification is a placeholder only. It is meant to pick up http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/259
    and provide a home for its considerations. It might be merged with other documents
    later.</p>"
