abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive
    resolver to use either opportunistic encryption (that is, encryption with optional
    authentication) or fully-authenticated encryption when communicating with authoritative
    servers. The motivating use case for this method is that more encryption on the
    Internet is better, some resolver operators will only want to offer fully-authenticated
    encryption when encryption is available, and some resolver operators believe that
    opportunistic encryption is better than no encryption at all. The method described
    here is optional for both the recursive resolver and the authoritative server.
    This method supports both fully-authenticate encryption and opportunistic encryption
    using the same mechanism for discovery of encryption support and discovery of
    authenticated public keys for the server. IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of the
    document is completely different than the earlier version. It now covers both
    opportunistic and fully-authenticated encryption. It is in a very rough state,
    and there are many holes in the description.</p>"
