abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an approach to enable emergency services over
    Wi-Fi access networks. These services encompass emergency services such as 911
    in North America, 112 in the European Union, and equivalent emergency services
    in other regulatory domains. The proposed approach aims to provide a comprehensive
    solution for supporting emergency communication across different regions and regulatory
    frameworks. Leveraging the legal framework and infrastructure of the OpenRoaming
    federation, this proposal aims to extend emergency calling capabilities to the
    vast number of OpenRoaming Wi-Fi hotspots that have already been deployed. The
    approach addresses critical challenges related to emergency calling, including
    discovery and authentication procedures for accessing networks that support emergency
    services, emergency access credentials, the configuration of emergency voice services,
    accurate location determination of the emergency caller, and call spofing. By
    providing a comprehensive solution, this proposal ensures that emergency communication
    services can be seamlessly and effectively supported within the IEEE 802.11-based
    Wi-Fi ecosystem leveraging Passpoint Profiles.</p>"
