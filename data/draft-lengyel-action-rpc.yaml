abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETCONF protocol defines a number of operations to read and write
    configuration data. However, it does not define actions on the managed nodes.
    Such actions are useful for 1) operations that do not change the configuration
    data (e.g. ping) 2) reading or writing a set of data that forms a logical group
    but might be scattered in different parts of the management data model. This document
    defines a new Netconf capability supporting a generic &lt;action&gt; operation.
    A modeling view of how the content of the generic &lt;action&gt; operation can
    be defined is also described. Please send comments to netconf@ops.ietf.org. To
    subscribe, use netconf-request@ops.ietf.org.</p>"
