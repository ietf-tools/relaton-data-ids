abstract:
- content: "<p>In conventional enterprise data centers, there are at least two networks:
    Ethernet that allows users to access their applications on servers, optical networks
    which built on Fiber Channel, that enables those servers to access big data on
    storage network. Because of their specialized hardware, they have vastly different
    management tools and require completely different skill sets to build and maintain.
    The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed to provide
    network related information to client applications. It has developed a lot in
    Ethernet, and now we consider to build a central control in a basic Ethernet and
    Optical converged networks. Follow the concept of ALTO implementing in Ethernet
    networks, an ALTO server can get the necessary information from underlining Ethernet
    and Optical converged networks. After abstracting the network information, ALTO
    server can achieve a central resource allocation and organize them into a standard
    format so as to provide useful information to ALTO clients. This document designs
    a basic way of applying ALTO in converged networks.</p>"
