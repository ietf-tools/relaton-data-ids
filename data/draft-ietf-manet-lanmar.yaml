abstract:
- content: "<p>The Landmark Routing Protocol (LANMAR) utilizes the concept of landmark
    for scalable routing in large, mobile ad hoc networks. It relies on the notion
    of group mobility: i.e., a logical group (for example a team of coworkers at a
    convention) moves in a coordinated fashion. The existence of such logical group
    can be efficiently reflected in the addressing scheme. It assumes that an IP like
    address is used consisting of a group ID (or subnet ID) and a host ID, i.e. &lt;Group
    ID, Host ID&gt;. A landmark is dynamically elected in each group. The route to
    a landmark is propagated throughout the network using a Distance Vector mechanism.
    Separately, each node in the network uses a scoped routing algorithm (e.g., FSR)
    to learn about routes within a given (max number of hops) scope. To route a packet
    to a destination outside its scope, a node will direct the packet to the landmark
    corresponding to the group ID of such destination. Once the packet approaches
    the landmark, it will typically be routed directly to the destination. A solution
    to nodes outside of the scope of their landmark (i.e., drifters) is also addressed
    in the draft. Thus, by summarizing in the corresponding landmarks the routing
    information of remote groups of nodes and by using the truncated local routing
    table, LANMAR dramatically reduces routing table size and routing update overhead
    in large networks. The dynamic election of landmarks enables LANMAR to cope with
    mobile environments. LANMAR is well suited to provide an efficient and scalable
    routing solution in large, mobile, ad hoc environments in which group behavior
    applies and high mobility renders traditional routing schemes inefficient.</p>"
