abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    [1] to allow SIP (and IP) into existing Voice Backbone Infrastructures that require
    Multi-Level Precedence and Pre- emption [2] Service throughout those networks.
    This document will also allow MLPP networks that are ISDN-based now to evolve/
    migrate or be replaced by a SIP-based Voice Signaling network with no loss in
    capability of that original network. More likely is the case that additional functionality
    and capabilities can be realized such as mobility and reduced user headaches (ex-
    plained later) with SIP being MLPP enabled within a network infrastructure.</p>"
