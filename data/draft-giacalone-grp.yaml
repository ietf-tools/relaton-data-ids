abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a simple mechanism, termed gateway response protocol
    (GRP), which permits hosts using Zero Configuration IPv4 Addresses [1] to find
    and use a default gateway, thereby gaining access to outside networks, including
    the Internet. GRP is fully compliant with rules limiting Zero Configuration addresses
    to local networks and does not negate source/destination address assumptions.</p>"
