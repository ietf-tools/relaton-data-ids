abstract:
- content: "<p>Generally, next SDP is alternative descriptions for the previous one
    of the same session. But there is other type of SDP which describe part of the
    session, not all aspects of the session. It must be combined with the previous
    one(or ones) to show the effects. There has been such usage of SDPs in RFC3108.
    But there is no such guidance for that extension and usage. This text is aimed
    for that.</p>"
