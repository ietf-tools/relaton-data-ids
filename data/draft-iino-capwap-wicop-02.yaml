abstract:
- content: "<p>The popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) has led to widespread
    deployments across different establishments. It has also translated into an increasing
    scale of the WLANs. Large-scale deployments made of large numbers of wireless
    termination points (WTPs) and covering substantial areas are increasingly common.
    The Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP) described in this document allows for
    the control and provisioning of large-scale WLANs. It enables central management
    of these networks and realizes the objectives set forth for the Control And Provisioning
    of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP). This document defines a Historic Document
    for the Internet community.</p>"
