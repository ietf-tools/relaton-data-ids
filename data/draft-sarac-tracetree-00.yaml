abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new mechanism for discovering multicast tree
    topology in the network. It uses the existing multicast forwarding state information
    to discovery tree topology in the source-to-receiver(s) direction. Scalability
    is provided by using a modified version of standard TTL based scoping. This draft
    identifies important issues necessary for discovering tree topology in the source-to-receiver(s)
    direction and discusses potential solutions to handle them.</p>"
