abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Broadcast Trivial File Transfer Protocol
    (BTFTP), a protocol designed to be used as a datagram based, multicast enabled
    protocol with optional back-channel. The main purpose of the protocol is data
    and file transfer over broadcast, wireless channels (e.g. Digital Video Broadcasting
    channels, like terrestrial DVB-T and satellite DVB-S [ISO13818]) without the need
    of a back-channel (which is optional). The efficiency of the protocol over a satellite
    and terrestrial wireless link has been widely tested.</p>"
