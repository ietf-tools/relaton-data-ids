abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding protocol
    extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do stateful control of MPLS
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP). One application that stateful
    PCE can realize is data traffic reoptimization. Data traffic traversed in a LSP
    can be switched to another PCE-initiated LSP. Moreover, data traffic can also
    be balanced to multiple PCE-initiated LSPs using stateful PCE. This document specifies
    the extensions to Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful
    PCE to do switchover and balancing of data traffic with PCE-initiated LSPs. This
    document also specifies the usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication
    Protocol) messages and the expected behavior of PCC as the RSVP-TE headend.</p>"
