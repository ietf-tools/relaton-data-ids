abstract:
- content: "<p>Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially due
    to bandwidth-hungry applications such as rich media applications and inter-data-center
    communications. In this context, it is important to optimally use the bandwidth
    in wired networks that extensively use link aggregation groups and equal-cost
    multipaths as techniques for bandwidth scaling. This document explores some of
    the mechanisms useful for achieving this.</p>"
