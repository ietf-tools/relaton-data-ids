abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
    do provision for optional trailing data. However, Route Monitoring messages (to
    provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing Information Base) and Peer Down messages
    (to indicate that a peering session was terminated) do not. Supporting optional
    data in TLV format across all BMP message types allows for an homogeneous and
    extensible surface that would be useful for the most different use- cases that
    need to convey additional data to a BMP station. While it is not intended for
    this document to cover any specific utilization scenario, it defines a simple
    way to support optional TLV data in all message types.</p>"
