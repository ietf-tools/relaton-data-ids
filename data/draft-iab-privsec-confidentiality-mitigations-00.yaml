abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB has published [I-D.iab-privsec-confidentiality-threat] in response
    to several revelations of pervasive attack on Internet communications. In this
    document we survey the mitigations to those threats which are currently available
    or which might plausibly be deployed. We discuss these primarily in the context
    of Internet protocol design, focusing on robustness to pervasive monitoring and
    avoidance of unwanted cross-mitigation impacts.</p>"
