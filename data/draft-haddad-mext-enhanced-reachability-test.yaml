abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo aims to improve Mobile IPv6 protocol security by enabling
    an enhanced care-of address rechability test for the home agent. The main goals
    are to discourage a rogue mobile node from misleading its home agent to flood
    a targeted foreign network and to empower the latter to thwart this type of attack
    if launched at a later stage.</p>"
