abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple protocol experiments have been proposed that involve changes
    to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) as specified in RFC 3168. This memo
    summarizes the proposed areas of experimentation to provide an overview to the
    Internet community and updates RFC 3168, a Proposed Standard RFC, to allow the
    experiments to proceed without requiring a standards process exception for each
    Experimental RFC to update RFC 3168. In addition, this memo makes related updates
    to the ECN specification for RTP in RFC 6679 for the same reason. Each experiment
    is still required to be documented in an Experimental RFC. This memo also records
    the conclusion of the ECN Nonce experiment in RFC 3540, obsoletes RFC 3540 and
    reclassifies it as Historic.</p>"
