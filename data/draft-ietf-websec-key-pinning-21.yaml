abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new HTTP header that allows web host operators
    to instruct user agents to remember ("pin") the hosts' cryptographic identities
    over a period of time. During that time, user agents (UAs) will require that the
    host presents a certificate chain including at least one Subject Public Key Info
    structure whose fingerprint matches one of the pinned fingerprints for that host.
    By effectively reducing the number of trusted authorities who can authenticate
    the domain during the lifetime of the pin, pinning may reduce the incidence of
    man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised Certification Authorities.</p>
