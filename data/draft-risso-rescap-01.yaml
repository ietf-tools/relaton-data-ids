abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details a protocol that can be used to capture and sample
    frames on a remote device. This protocol could be a possible solution for the
    'Report format and report stream format document' milestone of the PSAMP Working
    Group. This protocol defines a control connection, which is used to control the
    remote device, and a data connection, which is used to transport back the sampled
    data. This protocol includes has a set of optional parameters that allows customizing
    the behavior of the sampling process. This protocol can be used also for packet
    capture and it should be possible to implement it on both network devices (router
    and switches) and workstation hosts.</p>"
