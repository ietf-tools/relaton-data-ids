abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an alternative addressing architecture for IPv6
    which controls global routing growth by very aggressive topological aggregation.
    It includes support for scalable multi-homing as a distinguished service. It provides
    for future independent evolution of routing and forwarding models with essentially
    no impact on end systems. Finally, it frees sites and service resellers from the
    tyranny of CIDR-based aggregation by providing transparent re-homing of both.</p>"
