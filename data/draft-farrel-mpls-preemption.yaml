abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling is documented in 'RSVP-TE:
    Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels', RFC 3209, using mechanisms inherited from
    'Resource ReserVation Protocol -- Version 1 Functional Specification', RFC 2205.
    MPLS includes the concept of pre-emption where, for administrative reasons such
    as contention for system resources, a new Label Switched Path (LSP) may displace
    an existing LSP. This document clarifies the procedures for MPLS pre-emption in
    the light of implementation experience. The procedures in this document update
    those described in RFC 2205 and RFC 3209, but apply only to RSVP-TE used in the
    MPLS context.</p>"
