abstract:
- content: "<p>Usually in FMIPv6, the MN will start the binding process with its home
    agent and the correspondent nodes after it has attached to NAR. Till the binding
    is completed, the mobile node continues to receive packets via a reverse tunnel
    established between PAR and NAR. The duration of this tunnel will depend on the
    time it takes for the mobile node to complete its binding, till which time the
    tunnel will continue to consume buffer and processing resources related to maintaining
    the tunnel and forwarding packets through this tunnel in both PAR and NAR. This
    document specifies an extension to FMIPv6 to enhance its performance, in terms
    of resource management, by reducing the duration of the tunnel existence. This
    is achieved by enabling the NAR to act as a proxy for the MN for FMIPv6 handover.
    Additional message(s) and message options along with modifications to existing
    FMIPv6 messages and message options and definitions of new messages and message
    options to achieve the desired functionality is also described in this document.</p>"
