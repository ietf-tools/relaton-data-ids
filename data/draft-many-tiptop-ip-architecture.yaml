abstract:
- content: "<p>Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars
    is 4-24 minutes) and intermittent communications, because of orbital dynamics.
    The IP protocol stack used on Earth's Internet is based on assumptions of shorter
    delays and mostly uninterrupted communications. This document describes the architecture
    of the IP protocol stack tailored for its use in deep space. It involves buffering
    IP packets in IP forwarders facing intermittent links and adjusting transport
    protocol configuration and application protocol timers. This architecture applies
    to the Moon, Mars, or general interplanetary networking.</p>"
