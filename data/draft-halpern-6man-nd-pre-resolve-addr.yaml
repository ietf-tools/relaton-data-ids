abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new optional event to trigger address resolution
    using IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. This helps optimize router performance, and can
    help mitigate certain potential ND-related denial-of-service attacks. Upon receiving
    a DAD-NS message, the neighbor solicitation message used to detect duplicate addresses,
    if the target address encoded in the DAD-NS is not a duplicate address, the receiving
    device responds by triggering address resolution for the target address in the
    DAD-NS, in preparation for expectant future communication with the sending device.</p>"
