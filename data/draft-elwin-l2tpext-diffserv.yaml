abstract:
- content: "<p>L2TP provides layer-2 tunneling over long distances, and a single L2TP
    session is likely to carry different type of IP packets. Currently, one L2TP session
    carries only one payload session; for PPP session (payload) the LCP controls the
    corresponding L2TP session. Assigning one diffserv code point to a L2TP session,
    as mentioned in [ref-6] can not provide differentiated services for the different
    kind of IP packets that are tunneled. For example, VoIP and FTP packets, will
    have to be treated the same in the backbone, even though the intermediate nodes
    are diffserv capable.</p>"
