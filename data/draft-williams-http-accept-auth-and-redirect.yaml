abstract:
- content: '<p>The Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) offers several authentication
    schemes, but many sites use redirection-based protocols to authenticate users.
    Some servers are faced with a connundrum, having to choose between two mutually-exclusive
    options: redirect responses or 401 (authentication required) responses without
    knowing which the user-agent is most likely to support. This document specifies
    new HTTP request headers by which many applications can improve interoperability
    even without changing their HTTP implementations. These new headers allow user-agents
    to advertise authentication- and redirect-related capbilities that servers can
    use to better make authentication and/or redirect decisions. Also specified is
    a new HTTP authentication scheme named "Redirect" that enables communication between
    redirecting and redirected authorities via preservation of "Authorization" headers
    across redirections. This enables arbitrary authentication and authorization protocols
    to work without requiring user-agent support for them and without having to (ab)use
    URI query parameters.</p>'
