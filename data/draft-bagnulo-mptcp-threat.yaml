abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-addresses/Multi-path TCP (MPTCP for short) describes the extensions
    proposed for TCP so that each endpoint of a given TCP connection can use multiple
    IP addresses to exchange data (instead of a single IP address per endpoint as
    currently defined). Such extensions enable the exchange of segments using different
    source- destination address pairs, resulting in the capability of using multiple
    paths in a significant number of scenarios. In particular, some level of multihoming
    and mobility support can be achieved through these extensions. However, the support
    for multiple IP addresses per endpoint may have implications on the security of
    the resulting MPTCP protocol. This note includes a threat analysis for MPTCP.</p>"
