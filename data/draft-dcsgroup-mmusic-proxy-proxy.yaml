abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to deploy a residential telephone service at very large scale
    across different domains, it is necessary for trusted elements owned by different
    service providers to exchange trusted information that conveys customer-specific
    information and expectations about the parties involved in the call. This document
    describes extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (RFC2543) for supporting
    the exchange of customer information and billing information between trusted entities
    in the architecture described in &lt;draft-dcsgroup- mmusic-arch-00.txt&gt;.</p>"
