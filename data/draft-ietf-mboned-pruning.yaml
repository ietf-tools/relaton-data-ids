abstract:
- content: "<p>This document calls for the MBone to be free of non-pruning multicast
    as soon as possible, due to the high cost to the Internet of the traffic resulting
    from them. Consensus is that [DATE 1 month from RFC publication] is the goal date
    for elimating non-pruning multicast routers. It cites several ways to eliminate
    non-pruning multicast from a network, allowing per-site flexibility.</p>"
