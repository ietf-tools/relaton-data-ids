abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the RTP payload format of the Secure Communication
    Interoperability Protocol (SCIP). SCIP is an application layer protocol that provides
    end-to-end capability exchange, packetization/de-packetization of media, reliable
    transport, and payload encryption. SCIP handles packetization/de-packetization
    of the encrypted media and acts as a tunneling protocol, treating SCIP payloads
    as opaque octets to be encapsulated within RTP payloads prior to transmission
    or decapsulated on reception. SCIP payloads are sized to fit within the maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) when transported over RTP thereby avoiding fragmentation.
    SCIP transmits encrypted traffic and does not require the use of Secure RTP (SRTP)
    for payload protection. SCIP also provides for reliable transport at the application
    layer, so it is not necessary to negotiate RTCP retransmission capabilities. To
    establish reliable communications using SCIP over RTP, it is important that middle
    boxes avoid parsing or modifying SCIP payloads. Because SCIP payloads are confidentiality
    and integrity protected and are only decipherable by the originating and receiving
    SCIP devices, modification of the payload by middle boxes would be detected as
    an integrity failure in SCIP devices, resulting in retransmission and/or communication
    failure. Middle boxes do not need to parse the SCIP payloads to correctly transport
    them. Not only is parsing unnecessary to tunnel/detunnel SCIP within RTP, but
    the parsing and filtering of SCIP payloads by middle boxes would likely lead to
    ossification of the evolving SCIP protocol.</p>"
