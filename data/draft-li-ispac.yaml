abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of CIDR [1, 2] substantially changed the way that
    address allocation was performed in the Internet. The result is that address allocation
    is provider-based: the address used by a host depends on which service provider
    is used by the host. One of the unfortunate implications is that if a host changes
    provider, it must renumber. In many cases this is awkward, expensive, and difficult.</p>"
