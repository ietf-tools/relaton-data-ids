abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) define a process for validating
    received data and assert them authentic and complete as opposed to forged. This
    document clarifies the scope and responsibilities of DNSSEC Resolver Operators
    (DRO) as well as operational recommendations that DNSSEC validators operators
    SHOULD put in place in order to implement sufficient trust that makes DNSSEC validation
    output accurate. The recommendations described in this document include, provisioning
    mechanisms as well as monitoring and management mechanisms.</p>"
