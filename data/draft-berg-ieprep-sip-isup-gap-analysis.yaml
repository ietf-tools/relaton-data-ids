abstract:
- content: "<p>This document begins a gap analysis of SIP-ISUP mapping from the perspective
    of ieprep. Draft-ietf-sipping-isup-02 does not address mapping/translation for
    two ISUP IAM parameters of specific interest to ieprep: the mandatory Calling
    Party's Category and the optional Precedence parameters. On the assumption that
    both of these parameters should be mapped/translated in SIP-ISUP interworking,
    this ID begins with the proposal for a new SIP Resource-Priority header in work
    in progress in ieprep. Several variations on the proposed new header are formulated
    and assessed for use in mapping/translating the two IAM parameters. The ID concludes
    that either a single header with namespace differentiation of instances or two
    distinct headers would meet the needs of ieprep. It is recommended that this choice
    be made and reflected into draft-ietf-sipping-isup-02.</p>"
