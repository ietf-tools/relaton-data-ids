abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies how to use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocols,
    such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, to setup "unauthenticated" security associations (SAs)
    for use with the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the IPsec Authentication
    Header (AH). No IKE extensions are needed, but a Peer Authorization Database (PAD)
    extension in the form of an ID selector wildcard, 'UNKNOWN', specified. Unauthenticated
    IPsec is herein referred to by its popular acronym, "BTNS" (Better Than Nothing
    Security).</p>
