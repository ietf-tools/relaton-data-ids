abstract:
- content: "<p>IP addressing with references, or IPREF for short, is a method for
    end-to-end communication across different address spaces normally not reachable
    through native means. IPREF uses references to addresses instead of real addresses.
    It allows to reach across NAT/NAT6 and across protocols IPv4/IPv6. It is a pure
    layer 3 addressing feature that works with existing network protocols. IPREF forms
    addresses (IPREF addresses) made of context addresses and references. These IPREF
    addresses are publishable in Domain Name System (DNS). Any host in any address
    space, including behind NAT/ NAT6 or employing different protocol IPv4/IPv6, may
    publish IPREF addresses of its services in DNS. These services will be reachable
    from any address space, including those running different protocol IPv4/IPv6 or
    behind NAT/NAT6, provided both ends support IPREF. IPREF is especially useful
    for transitioning to IPv6 or for operating networks with a mix of IPv4/IPv6.</p>"
