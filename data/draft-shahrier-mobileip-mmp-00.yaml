abstract:
- content: "<p>The Future Mobile Internet has to support many types of traffic flows,
    including both real-time and non real-time services. In addition, the network
    has to keep account of the location of each mobile node (MN) as it moves around
    the network. This draft proposes a novel protocol that combines mobility management
    with optimal routing for use over the mobile air interface.</p>"
