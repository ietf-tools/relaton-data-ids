abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a solution, based on fractional addresses, to face
    the IPv4 public address exhaustion. It details the solution and presents a mock-up
    implementation, with the results of tests that validate the concept. It also describes
    architectures and how fractional addresses are used to overcome the IPv4 address
    shortage. A comparison with the alternative Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT) solutions
    is also elaborated in the document. The IPv6 variant of this solution is described
    in a companion draft.</p>"
