abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method called "dry-run DNSSEC" that allows
    for testing DNSSEC deployments without affecting the DNS service in case of DNSSEC
    errors. It accomplishes that by introducing a new DS Type Digest Algorithm that
    signals validating resolvers that dry-run DNSSEC is used for the zone. DNSSEC
    errors are then reported with DNS Error Reporting, but any bogus responses to
    clients are withheld. Instead, validating resolvers fallback from dry-run DNSSEC
    and provide the response that would have been answered without the presence of
    a dry-run DS. A further option is presented for clients to opt-in for dry-run
    DNSSEC errors and allow for end-to-end DNSSEC testing.</p>
