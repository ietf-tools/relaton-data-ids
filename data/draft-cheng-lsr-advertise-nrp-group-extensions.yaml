abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network
    into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes,structures, and functions
    so that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or customers. A Network
    Resource Partition (NRP) is a collection of resources in the underlay network.
    Each NRP is used as the underlay network construct to support one or a group of
    IETF network slice services. This document describes an IGP mechanism that is
    used to advertise a large number of NRPs into a smaller number of NRP groups.</p>"
