abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver
    a Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service. These services include Virtual Private
    Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN service (VPLS). This model is intended
    to be instantiated at management system to deliver the L2VPN service, and is not
    a configuration model to be used directly on network elements. This model provides
    an abstracted view of the Layer 2 VPN service configuration components. It will
    be up to a management system(orchestrator) to take this as an input and use specific
    configurations models to configure the different network elements to deliver the
    service. It is called as north bound L2VPN Service YANG data model. How configuration
    of network elements is out of scope of the document, and is defined in document[I-D.shah-bess-l2vpn-yang].</p>"
