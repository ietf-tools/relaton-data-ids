abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol that generalizes the concept of "endpoint properties",
    which were so far tied to IP addresses, to entities defined by a wide set of objects.
    Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost
    maps in the base ALTO protocol. While supporting the endpoints and related endpoint
    property service defined in RFC7285, the ALTO protocol is extended in two major
    directions. First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering
    a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties on specific endpoints
    to entire entity property maps. These extensions introduce additional features
    allowing entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.
    This is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property
    types.</p>
