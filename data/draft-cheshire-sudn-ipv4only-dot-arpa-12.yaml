abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification for how a client discovers its local network's NAT64
    prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose, but
    in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations section that specification indicates
    that the name actually has no particularly special properties would require special
    handling, and does not request IANA to record the name in the Special-Use Domain
    Names registry. Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of
    the name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use Domain Names registry
    as a name with special properties. As a result of this omission, in cases where
    software needs to give this name special treatment in order for it to work correctly,
    there was no clear mandate authorizing software authors to implement that special
    treatment. Software implementers were left with the choice between not implementing
    the special behavior necessary for the name queries to work correctly, or implementing
    the special behavior and being accused of being noncompliant with some RFC. This
    document describes the special treatment required, formally declares the special
    properties of the name, and adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse
    mapping names.</p>"
