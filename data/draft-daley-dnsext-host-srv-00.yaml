abstract:
- content: "<p>Where multiple application servers are able to receive inbound connections
    from clients, it is desirable provide some policy control over client behaviour.
    This specification allows application service providers to provide addresses of
    multiple servers in response to DNS queries, while specifying failover and load
    balancing behaviours. Multiple servers are specified using existing protocol mechanisms
    for DNS Service records (SRV). An experimental record definition is described,
    which can be implemented on existing systems.</p>"
