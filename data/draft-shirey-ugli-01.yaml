abstract:
- content: "<p>The ASCII-text file format of Request for Comments (RFC) documents
    was devised decades ago when the authoring tools were line editors like vi and
    text processors like nroff. The format still has great utility because it meets
    the constraints of many kinds of printing and display equipment, but it is difficult
    to produce with some of today's desktop publishing tools. This paper describes
    the RFC text file format and discusses its fine points; this should be useful
    to authors of RFCs and Internet Drafts regardless of their tools. This paper also
    describes the UGLI method, a hybrid method for producing RFCs by using modern
    software for composition and editing and using older software, applied in 'cookbook'
    fashion, to finish the job. The method is described in terms of Microsoft Word
    on an Apple Macintosh but is easily adaptable for other word processors on other
    platforms.</p>"
