abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses both use cases and operational experience with
    Multipath TCP (MPTCP) in real networks. It lists several prominent use cases where
    Multipath TCP has been considered and is being used. It also gives insight to
    some heuristics and decisions that have helped to realize these use cases and
    suggests possible improvements.</p>"
