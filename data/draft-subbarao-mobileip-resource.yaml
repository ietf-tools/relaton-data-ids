abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, in Mobile IP when an MN moves from one FA to another FA/CoA,
    relevant resources at the previous FA are consumed until its visitor entry for
    the MN expires. The Resource Release Message and Resource Management Extension
    described in this draft will facilitate the release of these valuable resources
    at the previous FA as the MN moves to a new location. The HA notifies the previous
    FA of any changes in the CoA for an MN, thereby allowing the FA to release its
    resources.</p>"
