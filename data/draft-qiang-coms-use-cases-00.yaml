abstract:
- content: "<p>The Common Operation and Management of network Slicing (COMS) intends
    to provide a comprehensive approach for the overall operation and management of
    network slicing in the scope if IETF. The system is designed in a hierarchical
    and inter-operative manner. COMS is capable of recursive adaption in a hierarchical
    network management system. It is also independent of data plane technologies used
    in different administrative domains. Both network slice operator and network slice
    tenant may benefit for COMS for the purpose of slice management and maitenance.The
    purpose of this document is to discuss the use cases of COMS in different views.</p>"
