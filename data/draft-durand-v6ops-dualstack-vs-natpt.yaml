abstract:
- content: "<p>Outside of the IETF community, lot of people think that IPv4 to IPv6
    transition consist merely at solving the problem of how does a v4 box communicate
    with a v6 box and vice versa. Within the IETF, the dual stack approach has long
    been defined. There is an ongoing discussion to understand if translation with
    tools like [NAT-PT] is absolutly needed to enable IPv6 nodes to communicate with
    an IPv4 node or if we can/should mandate IPv6 nodes to also deploy an IPv4 stack
    if/when they needs to communicate with IPv4 nodes. This draft is aimed at clarifying
    the discussion without taking side by studying in 3 cases the implications of
    mandating a dual-stack versus the implications of deploying a translation device.</p>"
