- content: "<p>There is no standardized method to describe assets used in a cloud
    such that they can be moved from one cloud to the next independent of the underlying
    architecture. This document defines Cloud Assets as a lightweight description
    of cloud resources and proposes a standardization of Cloud Assets into three major
    categories: Resource Assets, Component Assets, and Composite Assets.</p>"
