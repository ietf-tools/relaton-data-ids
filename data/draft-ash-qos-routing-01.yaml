abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient QoS resource management is needed for a host of existing
    and ever-increasing new services. For service performance, flexibility, and reduced
    cost it is preferable to provide integration of these services on a shared network.
    Such integration and sharing is facilitated by QoS resource management techniques
    described in the draft which are applicable to MPLS-based networks. Such QoS resource
    management techniques are used in PSTNs to standardize service classification,
    bandwidth allocation, bandwidth protection, and priority routing treatment for
    all network services. In the draft we illustrate the principles of QoS resource
    management and describe their application to MPLS-based networks. In the proposed
    QoS resource management method, bandwidth is allocated in discrete changes to
    each of three virtual networks (VNs) corresponding to high-priority key services,
    normal priority services, and best-effort lower priority services. Bandwidth changes
    in VN bandwidth capacity are determined by edge switch/routers based on an overall
    aggregated bandwidth demand for VN capacity (not on a per-connection demand basis).
    Based on the aggregated bandwidth demand, these edge switch/routers make periodic
    discrete changes in bandwidth allocation, that is, either increase or decrease
    bandwidth on the constraint-based routing label switched paths (CRLSPs) constituting
    the VN bandwidth capacity. We propose to add optional parameters in the constraint-based
    routing label distribution protocol (CRLDP) for QoS resource management. In particular,
    we propose an optional depth-of-search (DoS) type/length/value (TLV) parameter
    in the CRLDP label request message to control the bandwidth allocation on individual
    links in a CRLSP. In addition, we propose an optional modify-TLV parameter in
    the CRLDP label request message to allow modification of the assigned traffic
    parameters (such as peak data rate, committed data rate, etc.) of an already existing
    CRL</p>"
