abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a technique for a Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) server to initiate a TLS connection to a TLS client. This is accomplished
    by the TLS client listening on a port number sent from the client to the server
    during the initial TLS Handshake. This document defines a TLS extension for conveying
    a port number from the client to the server.</p>"
