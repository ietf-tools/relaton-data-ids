abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an architecture for intelligent optical networks.
    This architecture is called the automatic switched optical networks (ASON). ASON
    is a client-server architecture with well- defined interfaces that allows clients
    to request services from the optical network (server). ASON architecture and its
    generic automatic switched transport networks (ASTN) has been an active study
    area both at T1X1 and ITU [2].</p>"
