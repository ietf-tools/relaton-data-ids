abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a RESTful interface for local deployments to demonstrate
    proof of possession to a device or to a manufacturer authorized signing authority
    (MASA). This covers the case where a MASA would not otherwise have knowledge of
    where a device is deployed, or when a MASA may not be required. Such knowledge
    is important to onboard certain classes of devices, such as those on IEEE 802.11
    networks.</p>"
