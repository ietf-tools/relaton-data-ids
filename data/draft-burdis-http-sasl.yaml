abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to use the Upgrade mechanism in HTTP/1.1
    to initiate an SASL session over an existing TCP connection, performing authentication
    using a negotiated SASL mechanism and then tunnelling subsequent HTTP messages
    over this protected connection. It is based on RFC 2817 which describes how to
    upgrade to TLS from within HTTP.</p>"
