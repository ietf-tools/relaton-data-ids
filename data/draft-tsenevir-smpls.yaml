abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for securing the MPLS data plane,
    ie securing any data carried over MPLS. This work is split into two aspects: use
    of IKE to establish the required security association for secure MPLS and definition
    of the encapsulation formats required for the encryption and authentication of
    MPLS payloads. Extensions, under the form of a new Domain of Interpretation, are
    defined for the use of IKE to set up Security Associations for secure MPLS.</p>"
