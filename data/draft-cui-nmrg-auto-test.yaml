abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an AI-assisted framework for automating the
    testing of network protocol implementations. The proposed framework encompasses
    essential components such as protocol comprehension, test case generation, automated
    script and configuration synthesis, and iterative refinement through feedback
    mechanisms. In addition, the document defines a multi-level model of test automation
    maturity, ranging from fully manual procedures (Level 0) to fully autonomous and
    adaptive systems (Level 5), providing a structured approach to evaluating and
    advancing automation capabilities. Leveraging recent advancements in artificial
    intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), the framework illustrates
    how AI technologies can be applied to enhance the efficiency, scalability, and
    consistency of protocol testing. This document serves both as a reference architecture
    and as a roadmap to guide the evolution of protocol testing practices in light
    of emerging AI capabilities.</p>"
