abstract:
- content: "<p>Data minimization is an important privacy technique, as it can reduce
    the amount information exposed about a user. This document emphasizes the need
    for data minimization among primary protocol participants, such as between clients
    and servers. Avoiding data leakage to outside parties is of course very important
    as well, but both need to be considered in minimization. This is because is necessary
    to protect against endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests
    simply do not align with the interests of users. It is important to consider the
    role of a participant and limit any data provided to it according to that role.</p>"
