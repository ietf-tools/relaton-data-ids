abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents intelligent network management scenarios based
    on reinforcement-learning approaches. Nowadays, a heterogeneous network should
    usually provide real-time connectivity, the type of network management with the
    quality of real-time data, and transmission services generated by the operating
    system for an application service. With that reason intelligent management system
    is needed to support real-time connection and protection through efficient management
    of interfering network traffic for high-quality network data transmission in the
    both cloud and IoE network systems. Reinforcement-learning is one of the machine
    learning algorithms that can intelligently and autonomously provide to management
    systems over a communication network. Reinforcement-learning has developed and
    expanded with deep learning technique based on model-driven or data- driven technical
    approaches so that these trendy techniques have been widely to intelligently attempt
    an adaptive networking models with effective strategies in environmental disturbances
    over variety of networking areas.</p>"
