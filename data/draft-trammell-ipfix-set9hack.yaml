abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reserves the IPFIX Set IDs 9 and 10 to prevent them from
    being allocated in the future. The reason behind this is to ensure that heuristic
    methods for determining PDU boundaries in files containing NetFlow V9 PDUs and
    IPFIX Messages work in a standards- compliant way.</p>"
