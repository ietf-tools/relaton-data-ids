abstract:
- content: "<p>When the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group was chartered, an object
    identifier arc was donated by RSA Data Security for use by that working group.
    This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated
    arc, transfers control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies
    for any future assignments within that arc.</p>"
