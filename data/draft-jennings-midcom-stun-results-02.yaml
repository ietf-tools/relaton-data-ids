abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF has several groups that are considering the impact of NATs on
    various protocols. Having a classification of the types of NATs that are being
    developed and deployed is useful in gauging the impact of various solutions. This
    draft records the results of classifying NATs using the STUN protocol.</p>"
