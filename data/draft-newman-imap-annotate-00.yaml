abstract:
- content: "<p>Messages accessed via the IMAP4 [RFC1730] protocol are immutable in
    order to permit efficient disconnected access. However, many message systems not
    based on IMAP4 allow individual messages to be annotated in a number of ways.
    For example, one popular mail interface permits the user to enter a short message
    description for future reference. Other interfaces may wish to add text or voice
    annotations to messages in shared mailstores, or to store window positions for
    individual messages. This document defines the ANNOTATE extension to the IMAP4
    protocol which permits storage of arbitrary read-write per-message information,
    without destroying the valuable immutable property of the basic message text and
    headers.</p>"
