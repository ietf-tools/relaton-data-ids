abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to apply the Stateless Hash-Based Digital
    Signature Algorithm in Merkle Tree Ladder mode to the DNS Security Extensions.
    This combination is referred to as the SLH-DSA-MTL Signature scheme. This document
    describes how to specify SLH-DSA-MTL keys and signatures in DNSSEC. It uses both
    the SHA2 and SHAKE family of hash functions. This document also provides guidance
    for use of EDNS(0) in signature retrieval.</p>"
