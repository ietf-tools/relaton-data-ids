abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a forwarding method for bounded latency and bounded
    jitter for Deterministic Networks and is a variant of the IEEE TSN Cyclic Queuing
    and Forwarding (CQF) method. Tagged CQF (TCQF) supports more than 2 cycles and
    indicates the cycle number via an existing or new packet header field called the
    tag to replace the cycle mapping in CQF which is based purely on synchronized
    reception clock. This memo standardizes TCQF as a mechanism independent of the
    tagging method used. It also specifies tagging via the (1) the existing MPLS packet
    Traffic Class (TC) field for MPLS packets, (2) the IP/IPv6 DSCP field for IP/IPv6
    packets, and (3) a new TCQF Option header for IPv6 packets. Target benefits of
    TCQF include low end-to-end jitter, ease of high- speed hardware implementation,
    optional ability to support large number of flow in large networks via DiffServ
    style aggregation by applying TCQF to the DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet
    flow individually, and support of wide-area DetNet networks with arbitrary link
    latencies and latency variations as well as low accuracy clock synchronization.</p>"
