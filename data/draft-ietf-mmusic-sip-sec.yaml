abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a simple protocol designed
    to enable the invitation of users to multimedia sessions. This document is a companion
    draft to draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-04.txt, which defines SIP but doesn't specify any
    security mechanisms other than possible protection by lower-level security mechanisms
    such as SSL. This leaves SIP transactions vulnerable to attack and this document
    aims to extend the SIP protocol to address such security considerations. This
    document is a product of the Multiparty Multimedia Session Control (MMUSIC) working
    group of the Internet Engineering Task Force Comments are solicited and should
    be addressed to the working group's mailing list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the
    authors.</p>"
