abstract:
- content: "<p>This document clarifies DNS response message interpretation to avoid
    denial of service attacks using DNS responses. In a recent DNS software assessment
    it has come to light that some implementations respond to DNS response messages.
    A loop occurs if the receiver of this response responds with a response. It was
    never explicitly stated that response messages must not be answered. This draft
    makes the statement explicit.</p>"
