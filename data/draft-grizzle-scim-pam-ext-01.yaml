abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
    [RFC7643] provides schemas that represent common identity information about users
    and groups. Privileged Access Management (PAM) software typically makes use of
    common user and group models - as well as defining additional constructs - to
    provide fine-grained authorization and management for privileged access. This
    document contains a SCIM 2.0 extension for Privileged Access Management, which
    includes extensions to the core User and Group objects, and new resource types
    and schemas for standard Privileged Access Management constructs. This extension
    is intended to provide greater interoperability between PAM software and clients,
    a common language for PAM concepts, and a baseline that can be further extended
    to support more complex PAM requirements.</p>"
