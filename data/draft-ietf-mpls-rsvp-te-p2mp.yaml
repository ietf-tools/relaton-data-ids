abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol
    - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the set up of Traffic Engineered (TE) point-to-multipoint
    (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multi- Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. The solution relies on RSVP-TE without requiring
    a multicast routing protocol in the Service Provider core. Protocol elements and
    procedures for this solution are described. There can be various applications
    for P2MP TE LSPs such as IP multicast. Specification of how such applications
    will use a P2MP TE LSP is outside the scope of this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
