abstract:
- content: "<p>In the current Internet, a site is often secured by firewall, which
    filters harmful traffic from outside at the border of the site. This 'Border Defense
    Model', provides only a single line of defence and hinders the deployment of many
    next-generation Internet applications and services. This memo surveys the security
    issues of the 'Border Defense Model', and proposes a network architecture 'Quarantine
    Model', to provide a better security model and promote various end-to-end Internet
    usages. In our 'Quarantine Model', nodes shareing an Enterprise network network
    are connected to separate logical networks according to their security privilege
    level and community of interest. A different security policy is implemented on
    each logical network segment using the multiple security-related techniques, such
    as filtering, authentication, and encryption. This 'Compartmentalized' framework
    provides a better depth of network defenes and additional flexibility to our 'Quarantine
    Model'. This memo enumerates requirements and issues for this architecture. However,
    it is beyond the scope of this document to propose specific implementations or
    protocols.</p>"
