abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft outlines the information to be carried by the Service
    Support Transfer Protocol (SSTP) running on top of a reliable transport layer
    (such as TCP). The SSTP is for interconnection between the Internet and the Public
    Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), specifically, involving Web Server in the former;
    and Service Node (SN) or Service Control Point (SCP), and Service Management System
    (SMS) [1] in the latter. It is to support a combination of services provided otherwise
    disjointly by either of the network types. Service examples are those integrating
    the traditional telephony services on the PSTN and the World Wide Web-based services
    on the Internet like click-to-dial, click-to-fax, click-to-fax-back, and voice-access-to-content.</p>"
