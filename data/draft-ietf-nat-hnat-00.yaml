abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Address Translation has become a popular technique that allows
    private addresses unregistered with Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA)
    to be used by organizations within a private routing realm. These private addresses
    must not be advertised in the public Internet. Hence network address translator
    (NAT) are placed at the private routing realm border to translate private addresses
    to globally unique addresses and vice versa before packets are exchanged between
    the disparate routing realms. These modifications of the packet header by the
    NAT cause problems with the use of end-to-end security protocols such as IPSec
    and DNSSEC because network address translation does exactly what the security
    protocols are trying to prevent. Host Network Address Translation (HNAT) and Host
    Network Address Port Translation (NAPT), on the other hand, enable end hosts to
    carry out address (and port) translations before applying security algorithms.
    To make dynamic HNAT and HNAPT possible, three conditions are essential. First,
    there must exist a way for end hosts to discover the IP address of Host-NA(P)T-Server.
    Second, there must be a way for externally destined packets to be routed in the
    private domain between the Host -NA(P)T-Client and Host-NA(P)T-Server. Lastly,
    Host-NA(P)T-Client must be able to obtain an address (and port) binding from the
    Host-NA(P)T -Server dynamically. This draft aims to address these issues to a
    considerable extent. Methods suggested are by no means exhaustive in coverage
    and implementation specifics may vary from vendor to vendor.</p>"
