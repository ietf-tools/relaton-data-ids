abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism for Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)
    multicast that is compatible with Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE). The
    mechanism, named "Interplanetary Multicast" (IMC), comprises (a) a single network-wide
    multicast spanning tree overlaid on any single Bundle Protocol (BP)-based network,
    (b) multicast groups that take the form of ordinary BP non-singleton endpoints,
    (c) a new CBHE-compatible URI scheme, "imc", for expressing the identities of
    these endpoints, (d) a new type of BP administrative record that propagates multicast
    "petitions" (announcements regarding nodes' membership in IMC endpoints) through
    the multicast tree, and (e) a new bundle forwarding procedure by which bundles
    whose destinations are multicast groups are forwarded through the multicast tree
    in accord with previously received petitions. IMC is designed to provide simple
    and efficient multi-source, generally reliable, delay-tolerant multi-point data
    delivery in a network of arbitrary size. Anycast, content-centric networking,
    persistent messages, and similar research challenges are not explicitly supported.
    For research purposes and small-scale deployment, it is anticipated that multicast
    tree construction and maintenance can be manual. For larger networks an automated
    protocol for IMC tree management would be required; the design of such a protocol
    is beyond the scope of this specification.</p>
