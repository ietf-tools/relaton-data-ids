abstract:
- content: "<p>There were currently no described provisions to convert from an X.509v3
    certificate to a PGP Certificate and vice versa because of format of data being
    signed differ in these two standards. This document defines a new X.509v3 certificate
    extension called pgpKey that holds a verbatim PGP Certificate, making such conversion
    possible. This draft is being discussed on the 'x509pgp@egroups.com' mailing list.
