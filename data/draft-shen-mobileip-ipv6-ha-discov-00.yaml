abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to contribute to the development of
    Dynamic Home Agent Discovery in draft-ietf-mobileip-ip6-07.txt[1]. Dynamic Home
    Agent Discovery refers to a mobile node's ability to choose their own home agents
    while in a foreign net for Mobile IPv6. We have identified some shortcomings and
    ambiguities in the current draft specification during the implementation of Dynamic
    Home Agent Discovery. We are proposing enhancements and extensions that would
    benefit the protocol.</p>"
