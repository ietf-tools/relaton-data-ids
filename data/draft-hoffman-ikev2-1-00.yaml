abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes version 2.1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
    protocol. IKEv2.1 is heavily based on IKEv2 from RFC 4306 (edited by Charlie Kaufman),
    and includes all of the clarifications from the "IKEv2 Clarifications" document
    (edited by Pasi Eronen and Paul Hoffman). IKEv2.1 makes additional changes to
    those two documents in places where IKEv2 was unclear and the clarifications document
    did not commit to a particular protocol interpretation.</p>
