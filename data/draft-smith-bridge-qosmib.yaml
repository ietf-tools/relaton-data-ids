abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a SMIv2 MIB module for a device implementing bridging
    functions with Quality-of-Service mechanisms similar to those described for the
    Differentiated Services Architecture [DSARCH] which are described in detail by
    the Differentiated Services Router Conceptual Model [MODEL]. A MIB module for
    routers, the Diffserv MIB [DSMIB], has been developed that uses this model. The
    MIB module defined in this memo is designed to work in conjunction with that module:
    it defines usage for objects in that module and defines some new objects specific
    to MAC- layer bridges (a.k.a. Layer-2 switches). Specifically, if defines layer-2
    classifier and packet marking functionality.</p>"
