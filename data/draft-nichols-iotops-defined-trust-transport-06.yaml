abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a broadcast-oriented, many-to-many Defined-
    trust Transport (DeftT) framework that makes it simple to express and enforce
    application and deployment specific integrity, authentication, access control
    and behavior constraints directly in the protocol stack. DeftT enables secure
    and completely self- contained (e.g., no external identity servers or certificate
    authorities) overlay networks where credentialed members can join and leave at
    any time. DeftT is part of a Defined-trust Communications approach with a specific
    example implementation available. Combined with IPv6 multicast and modern hardware-based
    methods for securing keys and code, it provides an easy to use foundation for
    secure and efficient communications in Limited Domains (RFC8799), in particular
    for Operational Technology (OT) networks. Conventional IP transports create optionally
    secured one-to-one sessions. Where member identities exist, they must either be
    validated via external servers or all member identities must be be preconfigured
    in each member during enrollment. Synchronization of data across a domain is carried
    out through multiple two-party transport sessions. In contrast, DeftT is a multi-party
    transport that synchronizes collections of secured information across all enrolled
    members of a domain. Security in DeftT is not optional and members are preconfigured
    only with their own identities and the secured rules to authenticate other member
    identities. This document describes an architecture that is not a standard and
    does not enjoy IETF consensus. (The community is invited to consider standardizing
    its concepts and the specification.)</p>"
