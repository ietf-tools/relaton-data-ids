abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies Pairtree, a filesystem hierarchy for holding
    objects that are located within that hierarchy by mapping identifier strings to
    object directory (or folder) paths two characters at a time. If an object directory
    (folder) holds all the files, and nothing but the files, that comprise the object,
    a "pairtree" can be imported by a system that knows nothing about the nature or
    structure of the objects but can still deliver any object''s files by requested
    identifier. The mapping is reversible, so the importing system can also walk the
    pairtree and reliably enumerate all the contained object identifiers. To the extent
    that object dependencies are stored inside the pairtree (e.g., fast indexes stored
    outside contain only derivative data), simple or complex collections built on
    top of pairtrees can recover from index failures and reconstruct a collection
    view simply by walking the trees. Pairtrees have the advantage that many object
    operations, including backup and restore, can be performed with native operating
    system tools.1. The basic pairtree algorithm The pairtree algorithm maps an arbitrary
    UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded identifier string into a filesystem directory path based
    on successive pairs of characters, and also defines the reverse mapping (from
    pathname to identifier). In this document the word "directory" is used interchangeably
    with the word "folder" and all examples conform to Unix-based filesystem conventions
    which should tranlate easily to Windows conventions after substituting the path
    separator (''\'' instead of ''/''). Pairtree places no limitations on file and
    path lengths, so implementors thinking about maximal interoperation may wish to
    consider the issues listed in the Interoperability section of this document. The
    mapping from identifier string to path has two parts. First, the string is cleaned
    by converting characters that would be illegal or especially problemmatic in Unix
    or Windows filesystems. The cleaned string is then split into pairs of characters,
    each of which becomes a directory name in a filesystem path: successive pairs
    map to successive path components until there are no characters left, with the
    last component being either a 1- or 2-character directory name. The resulting
    path is known as a _pairpath_, or _ppath_. abcd -&gt; ab/cd/ abcdefg -&gt; ab/cd/ef/g/
    12-986xy4 -&gt; 12/-9/86/xy/4/ Armed with specific knowledge of a given namespace''s
    identifier distribution, one might achieve more balanced or efficient trees by
    mapping to paths from character groupings other than successive pairs. Pairtree
    assumes that this sort of optimization, however, being tailored to individual
    and transient namespace conditions, is often less important than having a single
    generalized and shareable mapping. It uses pairs of characters to achieve hierarchies
    that exhibit a reasonable balance of path length and fanout (number of probable
    entries in any component directory).2. Pairpath termination and object encapsulation
    A ppath (pairpath) terminates when it reaches an object. A little jargon helps
    explain this. A _shorty_ is a 1- or 2-character directory name, or any file or
    directory name that begins with "pairtree" (these are reserved for future use).
    A ppath consists of a sequence of "shorties" ending in a non-shorty, such as a
    3-character directory name or the 2-character file name "xy". The pairtree below
    contains two objects with identifiers "abcd" and "abcde". ab/ | \--- cd/ | |---
    foo/ | | README.txt | | thumbnail.gif | | | |--- master_images/ | | | ... | |
    ... | | | \--- gh/ | \--- e/ | \--- bar/ | metadata | 54321.wav | index.html An
    object is reached when a non-shorty is detected. An object is _properly encapsulated_
    if it is entirely contained in a non-shorty directory that is the immediate child
    of a shorty directory, in other words, if the 1- or 2-char directory name ending
    the object''s ppath contains exactly one non-shorty directory that holds all the
    object''s descendants. The two objects "abcd" and "abcde" above are properly encapsulated.
    Any shorty directory found at the same level as the non-shorty extends the pairtree.
    So while the "foo/" directory above does not subsume "e/" at the same level, by
    encapsulation, it does subsume the "gh/" underneath it (i.e., "gh/" is invisible
    to the pairtree algorithm, at least on a first pass). Practice will vary according
    to local custom as to how to name the encapsulating object directory beneath that
    last shorty. Its name is completely independent of the object identifier. For
    example, every object directory in a pairtree could have the uniform name "thingy".
    It is common for the directory name to be a terminal substring of the object identifier,
    as in: id: 13030_45xqv_793842495 ppath: 13/03/0_/45/xq/v_/79/38/42/49/5/793842495
    All objects should be properly encapsulated. If an object is detected that is
    _improperly encapsulated_, that is, when a ppath ends with a shorty directory
    that contains more than one non-shorty, the detecting system should take corrective
    action. In this situation, also known as a "split end", all those non-shorties
    (directories and files) are considered to belong to one object (not properly encapsulated)
    identified by the containing ppath. Excluding shorties from the object permits
    one identifier to be a substring of another (e.g., "abcd" and "abcde" can co-exist
    in a pairtree), and defining ppath termination in this way prevents "hidden riders",
    or data residing in a pairtree that is not contained or accounted for in any object.
    Here is an example of an improperly encapsulated object named "bent". be/ | \---
    nt/ [ split end: two files, no encapsulation ] | README.txt | report.pdf | \---
    ef/ | ... If a "split end" is encountered, an importing system is encouraged to
    normalize it by creating a single object directory called "obj" and pushing the
    non-shorties in question underneath it, as in: be/ | \--- nt/ | |--- obj/ [ split
    end repaired with "obj" directory ] | | README.txt | | report.pdf | \--- ef/ |
    ...</p>'
