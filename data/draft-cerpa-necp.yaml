abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes 'NECP', a lightweight protocol for signalling
    between servers and the network elements that forward traffic to them. It is intended
    for use in a wide variety of server applications, including for origin servers,
    proxies, and interception proxies. The network element may also be a range of
    devices, including so-called L4 or content-aware switches and load-balancing routers.
    NECP provides methods for network elements to learn about servers' capabilities,
    availability, and hints as to which flows can and can not be serviced. This allows
    network elements to perform load balancing across a farm of servers, redirection
    to interception proxies, and cut-through of flows that can not be served by the
    farm.</p>"
