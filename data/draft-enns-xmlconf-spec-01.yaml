abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need for standardized mechanisms to manipulate, install,
    edit, and delete the configuration of a network device. In addition, there is
    a need to retrieve device state information and receive asynchronous device state
    messages in a manner consistent with the configuration mechanisms. There is great
    interest in using an XML based data encoding because a significant set of tools
    for manipulating ASCII text and XML encoded data already exists.</p>"
