abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP[1] has emerged as a preferred solution for the macro mobility
    problem. In this draft, we discuss a possible extension to the existing Mobile
    IPv4 for multi-mode wireless terminals. This extension is based on [2] and has
    several advantages, including lesser packet delay, reduced traffic load on the
    home agent and lesser packet loss during handoff. In addition. This also allows
    the mobile node to take full advantage of Layer-2 specific features provided by
    the network. The proposal in this draft is in its initial stage and needs to be
    further studied.</p>"
