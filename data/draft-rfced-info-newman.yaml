- content: "<p>The General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP), is a general purpose
    protocol to control an ATM switch. GSMP allows a controller to establish and release
    connections across the switch; add and delete leaves on a point-to-multipoint
    connection; manage switch ports; request configuration information; and request
    statistics. This memo provides information for the Internet community. This memo
    does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
