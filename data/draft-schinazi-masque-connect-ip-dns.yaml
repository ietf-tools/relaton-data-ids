abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxying IP in HTTP allows building a VPN through HTTP load balancers.
    However, at the time of writing, that mechanism doesn't offer a mechanism for
    communicating DNS information inline. In contrast, most existing VPN protocols
    provide a mechanism to exchange DNS configuration information. This document describes
    an extension that exchanges this information using HTTP capsules.</p>"
