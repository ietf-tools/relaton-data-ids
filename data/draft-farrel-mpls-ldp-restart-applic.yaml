abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) systems will be used in core networks
    where system downtime must be kept to a minimum. Similarly, where MPLS is at the
    network edges (for example, in Provider Edge routers) system downtime must also
    be kept as small as possible. Many MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs) may, therefore,
    exploit Fault Tolerant (FT) hardware or software to provide high availability
    of the core networks. The details of how FT is achieved for the various components
    of an FT LSR, including the switching hardware and the TCP stack are implementation
    specific. How the software module itself chooses to implement FT for the state
    created by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is also implementation specific
    but there are several issues in the LDP specification in RFC 3036 'LDP Specification'
    that make it difficult to implement an FT LSR using the LDP protocols without
    some extensions to those protocols. Proposals have been made in 'Fault Tolerance
    for the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)' [LDP-FT] and 'Graceful Restart Mechanism
    for LDP' [LDP-RESTART] to address these issues. This document gives guidance on
    when it is advisable to implement some form of LDP restart mechanism and which
    approach might be more suitable. The issues and extensions described here are
    equally applicable to RFC 3212, 'Constraint-Based LSP Setup Using LDP' (CR-LDP).</p>"
