abstract:
- content: <p>CBOR has many advantages over other data serialization formats. One
    of its strengths is specifications and guidelines for serializing data deterministically,
    such that multiple agents serializing the same data automatically achieve consensus
    on the exact byte-level form of that serialized data. Nonetheless, determinism
    is an opt-in feature of the specification, and most existing CBOR codecs put the
    primary burden of correct deterministic serialization and validation of deterministic
    encoding during deserialization on the engineer. This document specifies a set
    of norms and practices for CBOR codec implementors intended to support deterministic
    CBOR ("dCBOR") at the codec API level.</p>
