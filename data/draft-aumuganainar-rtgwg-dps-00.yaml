abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes a network design architecture for routing packets
    via different paths available in the network based on application port number.
    Primarily, this is targeted for Enterprise customers who have built up redundancy
    at their WAN edge but are suffering from a congested primary link whilst the secondary
    is idle. The objective of this architecture is as follows 1) Offload bulky application
    on to the secondary link 2) Achieve the above with out introducing asymmetric
    routing in the network</p>"
