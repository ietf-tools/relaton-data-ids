abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was designed to support establishment
    and maintenance of end-to-end sessions. Proxy servers provide call routing, authentication
    and authorization, mobility, and other signaling services that are independent
    of the session. Effectively, proxies provide signaling policy enforcement. However,
    numerous scenarios have arisen which require the involvement of proxies in some
    aspect of the session policy. SIP has no support for such capabilities, as the
    community has generally considering involvement of proxies in session details
    'evil'. Practical implementations have therefore resorted to non-standard manipulation
    of SDP messages in order to enforce session policy. These implementations are
    fragile and frought with problems. In this document, we discuss a middle-ground
    approach which permits proxies limited involvement in session policy, but retains
    the robustness that derives from the current prohibition on SDP manipulation.</p>"
