abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the Prague congestion control scheme, which
    is derived from DCTCP and adapted for Internet traffic by implementing the Prague
    L4S requirements. Over paths with L4S support at the bottleneck, it adapts the
    DCTCP mechanisms to achieve consistently low latency and full throughput. It is
    defined independently of any particular transport protocol or operating system,
    but notes are added that highlight issues specific to certain transports and OSs.
    It is mainly based on the current default options of the reference Linux implementation
    of TCP Prague, but it includes experience from other implementations where available.
    It separately describes non-default and optional parts, as well as future plans.
    The implementation does not satisfy all the Prague requirements (yet) and the
    IETF might decide that certain requirements need to be relaxed as an outcome of
    the process of trying to satisfy them all. In two cases, research code is replaced
    by placeholders until full evaluation is complete.</p>"
