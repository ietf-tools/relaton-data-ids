abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently a common approach to IP network traffic engineering is the
    overlay approach where explicit end to end MPLS LSPs between all possible edge
    nodes are established to form a full mesh virtual network on top of the physical
    topology. By carefully choosing the routes for these LSPs, one can completely
    control how traffic flows across the network and therefore achieve any given traffic
    engineering objective. However scalability is a serious concern with this approach
    because it requires N square number of LSPs where N is the number of nodes.</p>"
