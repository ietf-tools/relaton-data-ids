abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes the definition of a standardized DiffServ code
    point (DSCP) to identify Non-Queue-Building flows (for example: interactive voice
    and video, gaming, machine to machine applications), along with a Per-Hop-Behavior
    (PHB) that provides a separate queue for such flows. The purpose of such a marking
    scheme is to enable networks to provide and utilize queues that are optimized
    to provide low latency and low loss for such Non-Queue-Building flows (e.g. shallow
    buffers, optimized media access parameters, etc.). This marking scheme and PHB
    has been developed primarily for use by access network segments, where queuing
    delays and queuing loss caused by Queue-Building protocols are manifested. In
    particular, applications to cable broadband links and mobile network radio and
    core segments are discussed.</p>"
