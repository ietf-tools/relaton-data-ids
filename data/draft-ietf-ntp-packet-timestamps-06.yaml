abstract:
- content: "<p>Various network protocols make use of binary-encoded timestamps that
    are incorporated in the protocol packet format, referred to as packet timestamps
    for short. This document specifies guidelines for defining packet timestamp formats
    in networking protocols at various layers. It also presents three recommended
    timestamp formats. The target audience of this memo includes network protocol
    designers. It is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp
    will, in most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats. If none of
    the recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol specification
    should specify the format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines
    in this document. The rationale behind defining a relatively small set of recommended
    formats is that it enables significant reuse; network protocols can typically
    reuse the timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) or the Precision
    Time Protocol (PTP), allowing a straightforward integration with an NTP or a PTP-based
    timer. Moreover, since accurate timestamping mechanisms are often implemented
    in hardware, a new network protocol that reuses an existing timestamp format can
    be quickly deployed using existing hardware timestamping capabilities.</p>"
