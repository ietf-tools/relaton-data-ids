abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Secure Routing Protocol (SRP), a route
    discovery protocol for ad hoc networks that mitigates the detrimental effects
    of maliciously behaving nodes that disrupt the route discovery in order to obstruct
    or disable the network operation. Our protocol provides correct routing information;
    i.e., factual, up-to-date and authentic connectivity information regarding a pair
    of nodes that wish to communicate in a secure manner. The sole requirement is
    that any two such end nodes have a security association. Accordingly, SRP does
    not require that any of the intermediate nodes perform cryptographic operations
    or have a prior association with the end nodes. The end-to-end operation of SRP
    allows for efficient cryptographic mechanisms, such as message authentication
    codes. More importantly, SRP can be used in a wide range of MANET instances, without
    restrictive assumptions on the underlying trust, network size and membership.</p>"
