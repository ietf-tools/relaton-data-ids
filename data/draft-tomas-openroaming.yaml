abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Wireless Broadband Alliance's OpenRoaming
    system. The OpenRoaming architectures enables a seamless onboarding experience
    for devices connecting to access networks that are part of the federation of access
    networks and identity providers. The primary objective of this document is to
    describe the protocols that form the foundation for this architecture, enabling
    providers to correctly configure their equipment to support interoperable OpenRoaming
    signalling exchanges. In addition, the topic of OpenRoaming has been raised in
    different IETF working groups, and therefore a secondary objective is to assist
    those discussions by describing the federation organization and framework.</p>"
