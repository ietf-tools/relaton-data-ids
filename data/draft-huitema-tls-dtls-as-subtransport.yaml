abstract:
- content: '<p>The developers of "user level" transports will benefit from a standard
    implementation of authentication and encryption. This can be achieved using DTLS
    as a sub-transport. Using DTLS enables developers to benefit from the investment
    in TLS, and removes the burden and the risks of re-creating similar technology.
    There are several requirements to ensure that DTLS is a suitable sub- transport:
    zero RTT setup, low overhead, and DOS prevention. The IAB SEMI workshop outlined
    other potential requirements: start/stop indication, and ability to accept indications
    from the network. The draft presents guidelines for meeting these requirements
    in a new version of DTLS.</p>'
