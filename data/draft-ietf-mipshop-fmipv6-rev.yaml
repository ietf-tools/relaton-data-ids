abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the
    Internet when moving from an Access Router to another, a process referred to as
    handover. During handover, there is a period when the Mobile Node is unable to
    send or receive packets due to both link switching delay and IP protocol operations.
    This ``handover latency'' resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely
    movement detection, new Care of Address configuration and Binding Update, is often
    unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP. Reducing the handover
    latency could be beneficial to non real-time, throughput-sensitive applications
    as well. This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to
    Mobile IPv6 procedures. This document does not address improving the link switching
    latency.</p>"
