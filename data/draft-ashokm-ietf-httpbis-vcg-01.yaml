abstract:
- content: "<p>The delivery of inappropriate video content for OTT and Social Media
    with HTTP video streaming is a serious worldwide problem. Most of the countries
    have established age-related and parental guidelines to warn about inappropriate
    or unintended content, particularly for children. However, these guidelines do
    not offer the freedom or convenience for audiences to avoid consumption of inappropriate
    content for their target age group instead just provide warning messages only.The
    Age-Relevant Video Content Guidelines (VCG) Standard defines a standard meta data
    format which covers fully and partially scene by scene age relevancy meta data
    for video and audio content and hence establishes a mechanism for delivering video
    and audio content tailored to the viewers' age groups. The Video Content Guidelines(VCG)
    is a meta data file which can enable existing HTTP based adaptive streaming standard
    like HLS, DASH, CMAF, MSS and HDS with updating manifest file using VCG meta data,
    that ensures only the target age-appropriate content is delivered to the audience
    and in-appropriate data can be skipped or modified so that different age group
    audience can choose what they want to watch. This ensures the compatibility of
    with the standard adaptive streaming protocols and players, so that the existing
    social Media and OTT streaming infrastructure continue to work without any major
    changes.</p>"
