abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol defines a way to establish
    IPsec security association between two end points. Normally the protocol requires
    a single authentication step to complete the exchange and establish IPsec security
    association between the end points. However, there are situations were more than
    one authentication exchange is required potentially with different authenticating
    domains. It is also possible that multiple authentication steps are performed
    to authenticate the endpoints for different services with different traffic selectors.
    This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 protocol to achieve this goal with
    a single IKE SA.</p>"
