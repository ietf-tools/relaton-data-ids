abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB) architecture
    provides cross-domain authentication, authorization and accounting functionality
    by utilizing well-established technologies, such as Diameter, the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP), and the Generic Security Services API (GSS-API). This document
    defines a Diameter application for usage with the ABFAB architecture to convey
    authentication information, and authorization decisions from the Diameter server
    (acting as the identity provider) to the Diameter client (acting as a relying
    party) encoded in a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) encoding.</p>"
