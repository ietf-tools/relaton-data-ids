abstract:
- content: "<p>The PIM WG intends to progress IGMPv3 and MLDv2 from Proposed Standards
    to Internet Standards. The WG decided to conduct a survey of operators, vendors
    and implementors of these and related protocols to gather information about their
    implementation and deployment. This document presents the results of the survey
    and briefly summarizes the key findings. The survey indicates that there is widespread
    deployment and usage of of IGMPv3 and MLDv2, with numerous independent implementations
    interoperating successfully. No major issues with either protocol were identified
    and, similarly, no major unused features in the specifications were highlighted.
    These findings suggest that IGMPv3 and MLDv2 are indeed ready for progression
    to Internet Standards.</p>"
