abstract:
- content: "<p>The scenarios where a Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) contains
    heterogeneous nodes need special considerations. For example, mobile devices,
    PCs and set-top boxes may all need to access and provide service for the same
    content. To support heterogeneity and maximize the total network utilization,
    it may be necessary to have layered coding of content to achieve desired results.
    This document defines the Layered P2P Streaming in PPSP with support for heterogeneous
    peer nodes.</p>"
