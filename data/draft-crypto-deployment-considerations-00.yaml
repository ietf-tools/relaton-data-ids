abstract:
- content: "<p>Many real world problems require implementing and deploying cryptography
    as part of the solution. In general, there is no single standard or set of requirements
    by which applications determine what type of cryptographic solution is best for
    their problem. Different applications and deployments can lead to varying tradeoffs
    in computation, memory, network, and bandwidth properties of a solution. Moreover,
    practical aspects of modern software engineering, especially around long-term
    maintenance costs, may influence what type of cryptographic solutions are deployed
    in practice. This document attempts to cover different factors that influence
    what type of cryptography is deployed in practice with the goal of helping cryptographic
    researchers navigate the tradeoffs and assumptions made in new and emerging work.</p>"
