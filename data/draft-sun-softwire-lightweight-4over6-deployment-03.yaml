abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation function
    from tunnel lwAFTR (AFTR) to lwB4s (B4s), and hence reduces the mapping scale
    on the lwAFTR to per-customer level. This document discusses various deployment
    models of Lightweight 4over6. It also describes the deployment considerations
    and applicability of the Lightweight 4over6 architecture.</p>"
