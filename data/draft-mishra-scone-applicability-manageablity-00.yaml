abstract:
- content: <p>This document identifies applicability of SCONE signal in a mobile network
    and outlines operational considerations, or manageability of SCONE signal in the
    operator network. Importantly, this document also describes 3GPP network elements
    that are capable of rate- limiting a UDP 4-tuple to communicate an upper bound
    on achievable bitrate termed "throughput advice" to implement SCONE protocol.</p>
