abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateless DHCPv6 [DHCPv6Light] is a light-weight DHCPv6 [DHCPv6] protocol
    in which the server manages only the service parameters like DNS server addresses,
    NTP server addresses etc., and hence there is no need to maintain the state of
    the clients, perhaps, it doesn't need to store any information about the clients
    at all. So, a renumbering event or change in some of the configuration parameters
    cannot be notified to the clients by the stateless DHCPv6 server. This specification
    provides a solution for this.</p>"
