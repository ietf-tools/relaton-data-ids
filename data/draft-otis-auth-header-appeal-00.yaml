abstract:
- content: <p>The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a header field
    used to capture email verification results obtained at border receptions has been
    approved for publication. However, serious deficiencies remain in its secure use
    and has prompted an appeal of the publication decision. This new header field
    is to convey to Mail User Agents (MUA) and downstream processes the verification
    results that are intended to augment handling decisions and message annotations
    that might be made visible to recipients. For such use, it is crucial to include
    within an "authenticated-results" header, a truly authenticated identity. The
    draft acknowledges that it confuses authorization with authentication in section
    1.5.2. This confusion has lead the draft to incorrectly elevate the authorization
    of an SMTP client into the authentication of an email-address domain. Elevating
    the *authorization* of the SMTP client into the *authentication* of an email-address
    domain incorrectly assumes current email practices adequately restrict the use
    of an email-address domain based upon the originating IP address of the SMTP client.
    In an era of carrier grade NATs, virtual servers, aggregated services, and other
    techniques that overload the IP address, this assumption is neither safe nor practical.
    Although the draft explicitly declares Sender-ID and SPF as the authorization
    of the transmitting SMTP client, it fails to offer the authenticated identity
    being trusted. A truly authenticated identity is essential for reputation assessments
    which section 4.1 indicates should be made prior to results being revealed. A
    reputation check of a truly authenticated identifier is often a necessary step
    needed to mitigate fraud and abuse. In addition, it is unfair to attribute fraud
    or abuse to the unauthenticated identifiers. Even so, the header offers no assurance
    that any reputation check has been made, nor does it ensure that an authenticated
    identity, the IP address of the SMTP client, can be determined by the MUA or downstream
    process. The goal of the appeal is to ensure adequate information is available
    when annotating email.</p>
