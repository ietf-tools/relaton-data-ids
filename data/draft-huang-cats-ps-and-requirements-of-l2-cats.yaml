abstract:
- content: "<p>The computing intensive parts of the customer premise equipment have
    been decoupled and migrated to the cloud, therefore the thin CPE remaining at
    customer premise needs to access its “avatar” virtual CPE in the cloud which could
    be deployed in multiple edge computing sites. This draft will illustrate a use
    case of L2 traffic steering in terms of dynamic computing and networking resource
    status, together with requirements for CATS as well as solution consideration
    with regard to particularly the difference from the L3 routing framework.</p>"
