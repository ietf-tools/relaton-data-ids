abstract:
- content: <p>The BGP (RFC4271) Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute (TEA) is defined in
    RFC9012. Currently proposed BGP specifications in the IDR and BESS Working groups
    have defined new tunnels and new parameters for these tunnels in Sub-TLV. The
    Segment Routing usage of the TEA has suggested a number of new Sub-TLVs. This
    document provides guidelines to help authors quickly write correct text for new
    tunnels (defined in tunnel TLVs) and new Sub-TLVs. These guidelines are given
    as "templates" to aid new authors. More experience authors should view these templates
    as a list of expected content. One additional challenge for tunnels using the
    PMSI tunnels is to carefully define the interaction between PMSI tunnels and TEA
    tunnels.</p>
