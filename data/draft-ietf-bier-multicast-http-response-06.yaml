abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP Level Multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case in the
    BIER Use Cases document. HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's video streaming
    and delivery services such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Augmented Reality and
    Virtual Reality(AR/VR), generally realized over IP Multicast as well as other
    use cases such as software update delivery. A realization of "HTTP Multicast"
    over "IP Multicast" is described for the video delivery use case. IP Multicast
    is commonly used for IPTV services. Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and Broadband
    Forum (BBF) also develope a reference architecture for IP Multicast service. A
    few problems with IP Multicast, such as waste of transmission bandwidth, increase
    in signaling when there are few users are described. Realization over BIER, through
    a BIER Multicast Overlay Layer, is described as an alternative. How BIER Multicast
    Overlay operation improves over IP Multicast, such as reduction in signaling,
    dynamic creation of multicast groups to reduce signaling and bandwidth wastage
    is described. We conclude with a few next steps.</p>
