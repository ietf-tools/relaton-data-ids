abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an analysis grid that can be used to evaluate,
    compare and contrast the numerous Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)-based recovery mechanisms
    currently proposed at the CCAMP Working Group. A detailed analysis of each of
    the recovery phases is provided using the terminology defined in [CCAMP-TERM].
    Also, this document focuses on transport plane survivability and recovery issues
    and not on control plane resilience and related aspects.</p>"
