abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    mechanism for authentication and session key distribution using the Global System
    for Mobile Communications (GSM) Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). GSM is a second
    generation mobile network standard. The EAP-SIM mechanism specifies enhancements
    to GSM authentication and key agreement whereby multiple authentication triplets
    can be combined to create authentication responses and session keys of greater
    strength than the individual GSM triplets. The mechanism also includes network
    authentication, user anonymity support, result indications, and a fast re-authentication
    procedure. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
