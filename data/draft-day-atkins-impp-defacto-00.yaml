abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a 'de facto IMPP charter' to accompany the IMPP submissions
    to the IESG. Such an arrangement is not ordinarily part of the IETF process, but
    appears to be the most effective means of providing necessary context to the IESG
    as it considers the IMPP documents. The first part of this document describes
    the circumstances that have led to this unusual de facto charter. The second part
    describes the IMPP charter as it has been understood by the current chairs.</p>"
