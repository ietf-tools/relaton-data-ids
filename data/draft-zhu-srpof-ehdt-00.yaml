abstract:
- content: "<p>It has already been confirmed that software-defined networking (SDN)
    can make the networks more programmable, adaptive and application aware. However,
    due to the large-scale and geographically-distributed nature of wide-area networks
    (WAN), the scalability could become a critical issue if we incorporate SDN for
    WANs (i.e., realizing SD- WANs). In this paper, we design and implement a novel
    network system that can leverage source routing with the protocol-oblivious forwarding
    (POF) to facilitate efficient e-Health data transfers with low setup latency.
    We develop the POF-based source routing protocol to realize a pipeline based packet
    processing procedure, which can replace the table-lookup based approach in traditional
    SDN networks and make the forwarding plane more efficient. The proposed scheme
    is demonstrated experimentally, and the results verify that with it, the flow-tables
    installed in each core switches in a POF-controlled SD- WAN can be minimized and
    the path setup latency of traffic flows can be reduced significantly as well.</p>"
