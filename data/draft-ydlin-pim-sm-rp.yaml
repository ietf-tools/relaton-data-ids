abstract:
- content: "<p>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol establishes
    core-base tree to forward multicast datagrams in a network. In PIM-SM, the core
    or Rendezvous Point (RP) of a group is determined at each multicast router by
    hashing a group address, i.e., a class-D IP address, to one of the candidate RPs.
    The hash function is characterized by its ability to evenly and uniquely choose
    the core for a group and remains insensitive to the geographic distribution of
    the group members and the sources. However, it may result in a multicast tree
    with high cost. This draft presents a relocation mechanism which is extension
    to PIM- SM, in which RP could be relocated periodically. When a new RP is found,
    the original RP informs all members to re-join to the new RP.</p>"
