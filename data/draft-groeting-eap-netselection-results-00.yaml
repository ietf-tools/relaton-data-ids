abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to highlight implementation results on network discovery
    as well as some new ideas for its extension. The implementation is based on the
    draft on mediating network discovery, a mechanism that enables a mobile node to
    discover roaming partners of an access network via EAP. The concept allows automatic
    network selection of end hosts, based on additional parameters, hence reducing
    interacting with the user.This document should also open a discussion on the need
    on network capability mechanisms.</p>"
