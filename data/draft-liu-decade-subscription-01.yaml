abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a potential performance issue in DECADE to
    support real-time applications. It shows the current content hashing based naming
    scheme might harm the performance when the content data is generated in real time
    and low propagation latency of the data is required. This draft propose a new
    naming scheme and protocol, subscribe/unsubscribe, for real-time applications
    to address the problem caused by content hashing. DECADE clients use subscribe/
    unsubscribe to express their interests to receive data streaming. DECADE servers
    pro-actively push stream data to eligible clients, which saves the time consumed
    on exchanging the hashing of new generated data.</p>"
