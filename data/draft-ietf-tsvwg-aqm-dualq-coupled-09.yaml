abstract:
- content: "<p>The Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture allows
    data flows over the public Internet to predictably achieve ultra-low queuing latency,
    generally zero congestion loss and scaling of per-flow throughput without the
    problems of traditional TCP. To achieve this, L4S data flows have to use one of
    the family of 'Scalable' congestion controls (Data Centre TCP and TCP Prague are
    examples) and a form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) with modified behaviour.
    However, until now, Scalable congestion controls did not co-exist with existing
    TCP Reno/Cubic traffic --- Scalable controls are so aggressive that 'Classic'
    TCP algorithms drive themselves to a small capacity share. Therefore, until now,
    L4S controls could only be deployed where a clean-slate environment could be arranged,
    such as in private data centres (hence the name DCTCP). This specification defines
    `DualQ Coupled Active Queue Management (AQM)', which enables these Scalable congestion
    controls to safely co-exist with Classic Internet traffic. The Coupled AQM ensures
    that competing Scalable and Classic flows run at about the same rate. It achieves
    this indirectly, without having to inspect transport layer flow identifiers, When
    tested in a residential broadband setting, DCTCP also achieves sub-millisecond
    average queuing delay and zero congestion loss under a wide range of mixes of
    DCTCP and `Classic' broadband Internet traffic, without compromising the performance
    of the Classic traffic. The solution also reduces network complexity and requires
    no configuration for the public Internet.</p>"
