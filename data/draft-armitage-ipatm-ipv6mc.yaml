abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt ('Support for Multicast
    over UNI 3.1 based ATM Networks') describes a mechanism for handling IP multicast
    over ATM. Whilst the architecture is intended to support multiple protocols such
    as IP, IPX, AppleTalk, etc, the current examples apply only to IPv4 environments.
    This document describes the specific encodings that should be used when running
    IPv6 over ATM. It is expected that some of this text will influence the revision
    of draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt or become a separate companion document in its
    own right.</p>"
