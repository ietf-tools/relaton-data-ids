abstract:
- content: "<p>Generic requirements and framework for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-
    Edge (PWE3) have been described in [PWE3-REQ] and [PWE3-FW]. This draft provides
    encapsulation formats and semantics for connecting SONET/SDH edge networks through
    a packet network using IP or MPLS. This basic application of SONET/SDH interworking
    will allow service providers to take advantage of new technologies in the core
    in order to provide traditional SONET/SDH services.</p>"
