    wide variety of technologies including packet switching (e.g., MPLS), time-division

    2010 spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber).
    In some of these technologies network elements and links may impose additional
    routing constraints such as asymmetric switch connectivity, non-local label assignment,
    and label range limitations on links. This document describes OSPF routing protocol
    extensions to support these kinds of constraints under the control of Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS).</p>"
