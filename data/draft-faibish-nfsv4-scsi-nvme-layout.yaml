- content: "<p>This document explains how to use the Parallel Network File System
    (pNFS) SCSI NVMe Layout Types with transports using the NVMe over Fabrics protocols.
    This draft picks the previous SCSI over NVMe draft of C. Hellwig and extended
    it to support all the types of transport protocols supported by NVMe transport
    over fabrics additional to the SCSI transport protocol introduced in pNFS SCSI
    Layout. The proposed transport protocols include support for several transports
    and fabrics and support the RDMA transports.</p>"
