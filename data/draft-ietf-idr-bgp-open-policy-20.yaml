abstract:
- content: "<p>Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate assumptions
    of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route learned from one transit
    provider to another transit provider or a lateral (i.e., non-transit) peer or
    announcing a route learned from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a
    transit provider. These are usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP
    route filtering or lack of coordination between autonomous systems (ASes). Existing
    approaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration,
    with no check that the configuration corresponds to that of the eBGP neighbor,
    or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree on the relationship. This document
    enhances the BGP OPEN message to establish an agreement of the relationship on
    each eBGP session between autonomous systems in order to enforce appropriate configuration
    on both sides. Propagated routes are then marked according to the agreed relationship,
    allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.</p>"
