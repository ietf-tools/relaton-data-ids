abstract:
- content: "<p>By collocating servers at base stations, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)
    provides low latency to users for real time applications such as Virtual Reality
    and Augmented Reality. To satisfy the growing demand of users, base stations are
    deployed densely in highly populated areas. Coordinated Multipoint Transmission
    (CoMP) allows users to connect to multiple base stations simultaneously. In ultra-dense
    networks, by offloading the partials of tasks to different base stations, users
    can achieve lower latency and utilize the computation ability of the surrounding
    base stations. To control the signaling overhead, the number of base stations
    that can be connected should be limited. In this paper, we propose a user-centric
    base station assignment algorithm by considering the possible load of base stations.
    Moreover, a partial task offloading algorithm is proposed to utilize the computation
    of under-loaded base stations. Resource allocation is then solved by convex optimization.</p>"
