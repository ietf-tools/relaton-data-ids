abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the publication of [RFC5050] a number of transport and convergence
    layer protocols have been developed to carry bundles between nodes in a delay-tolerant
    network. Before the publication of Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) in [RFC9171],
    there was only one standardized version of the Bundle Protocol, version 6, and
    as many of these transport and convergence-layer protocols pre-date the publication
    of version 7, they do not include any protocol mechanism to differentiate between
    versions of the Bundle Protocol. This document describes a mechanism by which
    an implementation can efficiently determine validity and the version of the Bundle
    Protocol that was used to encode a bundle by examining the initial octets of the
    encoded data, allowing this document to be used as a normative reference for updates
    to existing protocols. Additionally, this document updates [RFC9171] by defining
    a CBOR [RFC8949] tag that may be used as an explicit indicator that a particular
    indefinite-length CBOR array is a Bundle Protocol version 7 bundle.</p>"
