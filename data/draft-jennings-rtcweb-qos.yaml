abstract:
- content: "<p>Many networks, such as Service Provider and Enterprise networks, can
    provide per packet treatments based on Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCP)
    on a per hop basis. This document defines the recommended DSCP values for browsers
    to use for various classes of traffic. This draft is a very early and far from
    done. It is meant to provide the structure for the idea of how to do this but
    much discussion is needed about the details.</p>"
