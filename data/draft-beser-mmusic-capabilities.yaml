abstract:
- content: "<p>The need for assured communication arisen protocols like RSVP [2] and
    SBM [3] which are linked to access technologies to guarantee the delay and drop
    probabilities of a given IP flow. One of the side-effects of the assurance is
    that when the bandwidth of the IP flow goes outside the contracted region then
    the IP flow will be disturbed and the communication will be effected. This document
    discusses the effects of assured communication to SDP protocol, identifies the
    weaknesses and proposes a new attribute to rectify these weaknesses.</p>"
