abstract:
- content: "<p>A major responsibility of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers
    is to provide application-layer routing. SIP routing can be quite complex and
    lead to similarly complicated paths that SIP requests traverse on the way to their
    actual destinations. It is therefore important to be in position to troubleshoot
    errors that occur along a SIP path, inside and outside troubleshooters' administrative
    domains. Particularly important for the troubleshooters is knowledge of where
    an error occurred in a SIP path. This document introduces a new header field called
    Debug. The purpose of the header field is to convey extra debugging information
    that can be used to locate errors in SIP implementations involved in processing
    of a SIP transaction.</p>"
