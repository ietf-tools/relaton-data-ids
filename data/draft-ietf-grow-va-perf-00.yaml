abstract:
- content: <p>The document "FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation" [I-D.francis-intra-va]
    describes how router FIB size may be reduced. This approach entails a trade-off
    between path-length and load versus FIB size. It also has the potential to reduce
    convergence time. This document describes the results of several studies that
    examine these characteristics. The results of a study for a Tier-1 ISP with a
    relatively sophisticated deployment of VA, shows that FIB size could be reduced
    ten times or more with a worst-case latency penalty of 4ms and a worst-case load
    increase of &lt;1.5%. Another study, examining a much simpler style of VA deployment,
    also for a Tier-1 ISP, shows that FIB size can be reduced by four times (in routers
    serving as APRs), and more than 10 times in other routers. Here, worst-case latency
    increase was 16 ms, though this is almost certainly an over-estimate, both because
    traceroute was used to make the measurement, and because popular prefixes were
    not considered.</p>
