abstract:
- content: "<p>MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and Association of Music Electronics
    industry (AMEI) have recently produced the Scalable Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI) standard
    [1]. The SP-MIDI standard has been developed in particularly for mobile MIDI applications.
    SP-MIDI has been approved for 3GPP standardization and a dedicated SP-MIDI profile
    has been defined for 3GPP SP-MIDI devices [2]. Since MIDI information is a very
    compact media type 3GPP is initially focusing on the application of SP-MIDI for
    music downloading and messaging applications that require MIME registration.</p>"
