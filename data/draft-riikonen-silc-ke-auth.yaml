abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes two protocols used in the Secure Internet Live
    Conferencing (SILC) protocol, specified in the Secure Internet Live Conferencing,
    Protocol Specification [SILC1]. The SILC Key Exchange (SKE) protocol provides
    secure key exchange between two parties resulting into shared secret key material.
    The protocol is based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and its functionality
    is derived from several key exchange protocols. The second protocol, SILC Connection
    Authentication protocol provides user level authentication used when creating
    connections in SILC network. The protocol supports passphrase (pre-shared secret)
    authentication and public key (and certificate) authentication based on digital
    signatures.</p>"
