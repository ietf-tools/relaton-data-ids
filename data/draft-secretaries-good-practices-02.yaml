abstract:
- content: <p>The role of Working Group Secretaries has greatly evolved and increased
    in value since the writing of RFC 2418 ("IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures").
    This document further refines and enriches the description of the Working Group
    Secretarial role, and consequently updates RFC 2418. This document complements
    the succinct description of the role of Working Group Secretaries by providing
    a compilation of good practices and some general guidelines regarding the fulfilment
    of the role. This document may also be useful for Working Group Chairs to help
    develop and better appreciate the value of Working Group Secretaries.</p>
