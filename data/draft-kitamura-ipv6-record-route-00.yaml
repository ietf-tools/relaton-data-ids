abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a 'Record Route for IPv6 (RR6)' mechanism. It
    is composed of one new IPv6 hop-by-hop option (RR6 option) extension. The RR6
    mechanism is redesigned to establish an optimized record route mechanism for IPv6.
    Two types of new features are introduced. 1. In order to prevent scalability problems
    and to make the mechanism flexible, the beginning and ending points of the data
    recording range are controlled by using their specifiers. 2. In order to record
    long IPv6 addresses efficiently, a simple address compression method is introduced.
    Since the compression is achieved by utilizing characteristics of recorded IPv6
    addresses effectively, the mechanism is efficient and optimized for IPv6.</p>"
