abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts
    of hosts in the data center. There was a discussion, in ARMD, involving the issues
    with address resolution for non ARP/ND multicast traffic in data centers with
    massive number of hosts. This document provides a quick survey of multicast in
    the data center and should serve as an aid to further discussion of issues related
    to large amounts of multicast in the data center.</p>"
