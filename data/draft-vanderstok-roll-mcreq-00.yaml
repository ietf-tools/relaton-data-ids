abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a working document intended to focus discussion on requirements
    for multicast in Low-power and Lossy Networks in the area of M2M communication
    for control purposes. The Trickle algorithm, which uses re-broadcasting to assure
    that messages arrive at all destinations, is proposed as the ROLL multicast protocol.
    In this draft additional requirements on Trickle, such as timeliness and ordering,
    are motivated by building control. Re-broadcasting and timeliness can be mutually
    exclusive properties. To alleviate that problem, this draft considers the possibility
    of reducing interference by limiting the number of transmission paths between
    any two devices in the mesh.</p>"
