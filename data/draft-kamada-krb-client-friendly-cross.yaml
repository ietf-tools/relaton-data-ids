abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a cross-realm traversal model, which is suitable
    for resource-limited clients, for Kerberos Version 5. This model relieves the
    clients of the traversal cost by two means. One moves the cost of consecutive
    Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) exchanges from clients to Key Distribution Centers
    (KDCs). The other reduces the traversal cost itself by generating a direct inter-realm
    relationship between two realms. The document describes behavior of clients and
    KDCs, but does not specify any wire format, which need to be specified separately.</p>"
