abstract:
- content: "<p>Protocol mechanisms for fast mobile multicast in IPv6 based on multicast
    listening context transfer are proposed. The focus is the context transfer for
    mobile multicast listeners using Multicast Listener Discovery protocol Version
    2 (MLDv2). Multicast context transfer block and operational considerations for
    optimised multicast context transfer based on Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 and
    Candidate Access Router Discovery are described. The requirements for MLDv2 context
    extension and operation at access routers to support multicast context transfer
    for mobile IPv6 are specified. Interactions of MLDv2 with Protocol Independent
    Multicast Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) for multicast routing state update based on multicast
    listening context transfer are overviewed. Operational considerations for MLDv2
    and PIM-SM to support multicast receiver and source mobility based on context
    transfer are discussed. Comparison with other multicast protocol proposals for
    Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is given.</p>"
